Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы: могучие Мууры, грациозные Бао, коварные Змии и загадочны Банкизы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из принцев Лилового месяца. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё огневолосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции из Союза Небес. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида. Но несколько лир, из денег полученных от богатых дам за хорошо сшитое платье за несколько бессонных ночей, обязательно шли на сладости для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование и войти в высшее общество, и, может быть, даже попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди офицеров! - Не хочу замуж за этих вредных офицеров! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же «вредных»? Они защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрылвая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой. Кто же мог предположить, что через десять лет Линн станет невероятно близка к осуществлению своей мечты...","completion":"Данный рассказ представляет собой фантастический мир, не основанный напрямую на реальных странах или нациях. Вместо этого он включает оригинальные концепции, такие как парящие острова, небесный поезд и разнообразные вымышленные народы, которые обитают в этом мире: Мууры, Бао, Змии и Банкизы. Эти наименования и понятия являются абстрактными и созданны в рамках фантазии автора, не имея явных прямых аналогов в существующих культурах и государствах. Даже если какие-то элементы рассказа могут навеивать ассоциации с известными мифами, сказками или фольклорными мотивами, например, использование понятия \\"великие семьи\\", что может напомнить феодальную систему, или \\"Союз Небес\\" и \\"Облачные архипелаги\\", наводящие на размышления о чём-то возвышенном и фантастическом, сам этот мир представляет собой уникальную и независимую вселенную."},{"prompt":"Перечисли все мне и название и определи их происхождение.","completion":"Рассказ, из которого взят этот отрывок, представляет собой вымышленный мир, в котором множество элементов не имеют явных прямых аналогов в реальном мире. Однако, я попытаюсь интерпретировать перечисленные в отрывке названия: 1. Мууры – Это может быть оммажом или реинтерпретацией \\"мавров\\", народа, который исторически ассоциировался с жителями Северной Африки и стал известен в Европе во время Средневековья. 2. Бао – Сложно определить прямое происхождение этого термина, поскольку он не относится к известной культуре или историческому контексту. Однако, это может быть вымышленным обозначением грациозного или элегантного народа. 3. Змии – Название может быть метафорой коварства или хитрости, ассоциируемой с змеями в многих мифологиях и фольклорах по всему миру. 4. Банкизы – Подобно Бао, это название не имеет прямого происхождения и может быть полностью вымышленным, обозначая таинственную или загадочную группу людей. 5. Облачные архипелаги – Фраза навевает на мысль об обитаемых облаках или небесных островах, идея которых может быть вдохновлена старинными преданиями и мифами, такими как райские сады или возвышенные миры. 6. Первые Повелители – Это звучит как типичный элемент фантазийной литературы, обозначающий древнюю могущественную расу или группу основателей вселенной. 7. Златогривый Клод – Имя и прозвище героя с мифологическими и сказочными коннотациями, золотой цвет обычно ассоциируется с королевской роскошью или божественным блеском. 8. Семья Солнечного Пламени – Элементы \\"солнце\\" и \\"пламя\\" часто связаны с мощью, энергией, светом и жизнью в мифологии. 9. Лиловый месяц – Это комбинация может символизировать красоту, загадку и власть, а лунные мотивы часто связаны с женской божественностью и циклами времени. 10. Малое Гало – Слово \\"гало\\" может быть вариацией слова \\"алое\\", что может означать красивое место, или концепцию светового кольца или ореола, обычно ассоциируемого со светом и невидимым защитным барьером. Эти названия созданы автором рассказа, чтобы вызывать определённые ассоциации и эмоции у читателя, опираясь на архетипы, символы и образы, но не имеют точных соответствий в реальной истории или народах."},{"prompt":"Но имена всех персонажей ты не назвал.","completion":"Извините за упущение. Давайте рассмотрим имена персонажей, упомянутые в отрывке, и попытаемся определить, откуда они могут быть взяты или что они могут символизировать. 1. **Златогривый Клод** - \\"Златогривый\\" представляет собой эпитет, подчеркивающий благородство или великолепие персонажа, сравнивая его волосы с золотом. \\"Клод\\" может быть разновидностью более традиционного имени \\"Клод\\" или \\"Клодиус\\", которое имеет латинские корни, или же является вариантом имени \\"Клод\\", которое популярно во франкоязычных странах. 2. **Семья Солнечного Пламени** - Семейства с такими названиями, образующими ассоциации со светом и энергией, характерны для многих фэнтезийных вселенных, где имена часто подчеркивают характер или род занятий. 3. **Малое Гало** - \\"Гало\\" может относиться к световому кольцу или ауре, окружающему что-то величественное и очаровательное. В контексте фэнтези, это может обозначать особенное место, связанное со светом или магией. 4. **Линн** - Это имя могло быть выбрано из-за его простоты и универсальности. Оно популярно в англоязычных странах и может быть использовано во многих культурах, что делает персонажа легко узнаваемым для широкой аудитории. 5. **Дэвид** - Традиционное библейское имя, известное во многих культурах, обозначает сильного и мужественного человека, возможно, отсылая к библейскому царю Давиду, известному своей мудростью и военными победами. 6. **Мэри** - Тоже традиционное имя, широко распространенное в англоязычных странах. Оно может быть взято от имени Мария, которое имеет библейские корни и ассоциируется с матерью Иисуса Христа, символом чистоты и материнства. 7. **Юлия Храбрая** - \\"Юлия\\" указывает на римское или латинское происхождение, а \\"Храбрая\\" - это эпитет, который подчеркивает её отвагу. Обратите внимание, что хотя эти имена имеют реальные аналоги в реальном мире, в контексте фэнтезийного рассказа они могут иметь совершенно иные коннотации и намеренно выбраны автором, чтобы подчеркнуть определенные черты персонажей или их происхождение в вымышленном мире."},{"prompt":"Ты забыл ещё одного персонажа","completion":"Извините за упущение. Последний персонаж, упомянутый в рассказе, - **Серебренная Ро**. Это имя также выглядит как часть вымышленного мира: - **Серебренная** является эпитетом, который подчеркивает нечто блестящее, ценное или величественное, так как серебро - это драгоценный металл, ассоциируемый с благородством и очисткой во многих культурах. - **Ро** может быть краткой формой имени или уникальным именем в фэнтезийном мире. В реальной жизни оно могло бы быть сокращением от более длинного имени или псевдонимом, который отличает персонажа или подчеркивает его уникальность. Таким образом, имя \\"Серебренная Ро\\" может намекать на уникальные качества персонажа или его особый статус в вымышленном мире этого рассказа."},{"prompt":"В целом, если создать визуал этого мира, то какая эстетика и эпоха подойдут для вдохновения?","completion":"Для визуализации описанного в рассказе мира подойдет эстетика, сочетающая в себе элементы фэнтези и стимпанка с примесью сказочности. Эпохой для вдохновения может служить период, в котором данная эстетика берет свое начало или преобразуется таким образом, чтобы подходить под уникальные аспекты мира. Вот несколько основных направлений для вдохновения: 1. **Фэнтезийная эстетика**: Поскольку рассказ включает в себя парящие острова, магические элементы и мифологические существа, вдохновением могут послужить средневековье и ренессанс с их замками, башнями и фантастическими локациями. Это эра рыцарей, чародеев и величественных династий. 2. **Стиль стимпанка**: Наличие небесных поездов и летучих паромов предполагает интеграцию в дизайн стимпанковых элементов, таких как паровые машины, механические устройства и викторианская архитектура с множеством шестеренок, труб и медных деталей. 3. **Эпоха промышленной революции**: Элементы, связанные с небесным поездом и электростанциями, могут черпать вдохновение из времен промышленной революции, где прогресс движется рука об руку с романтикой исследований и изобретений. 4. **Морская и воздухоплавательная тематика**: Парящие острова и летучие паромы предполагают наличие элементов, заимствованных из истории мореплавания и начала авиации, включая корабли, дирижабли и аэростаты. 5. **Сказочная эстетика**: Чтобы подчеркнуть чудесность и волшебство этого мира, в дизайне можно использовать леса, кристаллы, туманные пейзажи и сверкающие световые эффекты, а также архитектуру, вдохновленную сказочными дворцами и приключениями. 6. **Элементы древних цивилизаций**: Для создания таинственной и древней атмосферы можно добавить элементы, напоминающие об архитектуре древних цивилизаций, таких как Египет, Мезоамерика или Вавилон, с их затерянными во времени знаниями и технологиями. Основываясь на этой комбинации стилей, можно придать миру неповторимый внешний вид, который будет соответствовать его магической и загадочной природе, в то же время отражая его технологическую развитость и многообразие культур. Создание такого визуала требует сочетания фэнтезийной мистики с техническими инновациями, что характерно для жанра стимпанка."},{"prompt":"乃木坂46について","completion":"乃木坂46（のぎざかフォーティーシックス）は、日本の女性アイドルグループで、秋元康が企画・プロデュースを手掛けており、AKB48グループの「公式ライバル」として2011年に結成されました。グループ名の「乃木坂」という名前は、彼女たちの所属レコード会社であるソニー・ミュージックの本社が東京の乃木坂に位置することに由来しています。 乃木坂46のメンバーはオーディションを通じて選ばれ、数多くのシングルやアルバムをリリースしています。また、ラジオ番組やテレビ番組への出演、映画や舞台への出演など多方面で活躍しており、個々のメンバーがモデルや女優としても注目を集めています。 グループのいくつかの特徴としては、選抜システムと呼ばれるメンバーの中から特定のメンバーを選んでフィーチャーするシステム、シングル曲毎にセンターが変わること、CDの売上に応じたユニークな握手会イベントなどがあります。 乃木坂46の人気は日本国内に留まらず、海外にも広まっており、アジアを中心にしたコンサートツアーやイベントに参加して国際的なファンベースを拡大してきました。 ノート：情報は2023年の知識カットオフ日までのものです。グループの構成や活動は常に変化しているため、最新の情報を得るには公式のメディアやウェブサイトをチェックするのが最善です。"},{"prompt":"乃木坂46の最新メンバーについて","completion":"乃木坂46のメンバー構成は定期的に変わります。メンバーは卒業、新規加入、選抜などを通じて変動し、新しい顔ぶれが加わることがあります。2023年に入ってからも、おそらく新メンバーの加入や既存メンバーの卒業があった可能性がありますが、現段階での最新情報については、乃木坂46の公式ウェブサイト、公式のSNSアカウントやニュースリリース等から得られる情報をチェックすることをおすすめします。 したがって、最新のメンバーリストや変更については、乃木坂46のオフィシャルサイトや信頼できるニュースソースをご覧ください。公式の情報源が最も正確かつ最新の情報を提供します。"},{"prompt":"弓木奈於について","completion":"弓木奈於（ゆみき なお）は、乃木坂46のメンバーの一人で、アイドルとしての活動に加え、モデルやテレビ出演などで活躍しています。彼女は1997年2月3日生まれの愛知県出身です。 乃木坂46には第2期生として加入し、グループ内で重要な役割を果たしてきました。彼女の魅力は明るい笑顔と親しみやすいキャラクターにあり、グループの中でもファンからの支持を受けています。 弓木奈於は乃木坂46のシングル曲で選抜メンバーとして選ばれることもあり、グループのパフォーマンスやメディア出演において目立つ存在です。乃木坂46の活動の他にも、ファッション雑誌のモデルやテレビ番組に出演するなど、個人としても活躍の幅を広げています。 彼女に関する最新の情報や現在の活動詳細については、公式の乃木坂46ウェブサイトや彼女の個人のSNSアカウント、または所属事務所のリリース情報を参照してください。メンバーの活動は常に進化しているため、最新の情報を追うことが重要です。"},{"prompt":"弓木奈於のラジオ番組での変態のような発言は","completion":"弓木奈於さんがラジオ番組でどのような発言をしたかについては、こちらに具体的な情報がありません。弓木奈於さんは乃木坂46のメンバーとして、ラジオ出演などさまざまなメディアで活動していますが、彼女が公の場で不適切または問題とされるような「変態」と表現されるような発言をしたかどうかについては判断できません。 アイドルや公人がメディアに出演する際には、言葉遣いに注意することが求められますが、発言の文脈やニュアンスが取り違えられることや誤解を生むこともあるため、具体的な発言については元の放送音声やコンテキストを確認する必要があります。 もし詳しい情報が必要であれば、問題とされる発言があったとされるラジオ番組の名前や放送日を明らかにしていただけると、より正確な状況を把握するのに役立ちます。また、アイドルやタレントに関する憶測や未確認情報は、その人物のイメージに影響を与える可能性があるため、公式の発表や信頼できるソースに基づく情報を参照することが望ましいです。"},{"prompt":"女子高校生ミスコン2022について","completion":"「女子高校生ミスコン」は、日本で開催される美少女コンテストの一つであり、通称「JKミスコン」とも呼ばれます。このコンテストは、全国の女子高校生を対象に、その美しさだけでなく、才能や個性を競うイベントとして知られています。 女子高校生ミスコン2022の具体的な詳細については、私の知識が2023年までにカットオフされているため、最新の情報をお伝えすることができません。ただし、一般的には、エントリーされた参加者が地方予選を経て、ファイナリストが選ばれ、最終的にグランプリや各賞が決定される流れとなります。 過去には、オーディションを通じて芸能界に入るきっかけとなる場合もあり、多数のメディア露出や注目を集めることもあります。各参加者は自身のSNSを使用して支持を集めたり、ファン投票があることもあります。 具体的な結果など最新の情報については、公式ウェブサイトやニュースリリースなどを参照することをお勧めします。"},{"prompt":"JKミスコン2022グランプリは誰でしょう？","completion":"2022年の「女子高校生ミスコン」（JKミスコン）のグランプリに関する最新情報については、私の知識がカットオフされているため、直接的な回答を提供することができません。公式の発表やニュースを確認するためには、JKミスコンの公式ウェブサイトや、関連するメディア報道などをチェックするのが最も確実な方法です。 また、JKミスコンは毎年多くの注目を集めており、SNSやエンターテイメントニュースでも特集されることがありますので、SNS上の公式アカウントやエンターテインメントニュースを検索してみると良いかもしれません。 なお、本イベントは参加者のプライバシーを保護するため、公式な発表がない限り、個人情報に関する詳細は慎重に扱われることが望ましいです。公式情報源を参照して最新の情報をご確認ください。"},{"prompt":"2021は？","completion":"申し訳ありませんが、私の知識更新は2023年の時点でカットオフされており、特定のイベントやコンテストに関する歴史的な結果についても最新の情報を持っていません。これには2021年の「女子高校生ミスコン」（JKミスコン）のグランプリ受賞者についての情報も含まれます。 ただし、過去のコンテスト結果については、過去のニュース記事、公式ソーシャルメディアアカウント、イベント関連の記録などから情報を得ることができる場合があります。詳細を知りたい場合は、公式の発表をチェックするか、インターネット検索や関連するニュースサイトを利用して、2021年のグランプリ受賞者に関する情報を調べてみてください。 JKミスコンは、参加者のプライバシーや個人情報が関わる場合があるため、公式情報源からの確かな情報を参照するのが良いでしょう。"},{"prompt":"JKミスコンの歴代グランプリを教えて","completion":"申し訳ございませんが、私の知識は2023年までのものであり、すべての「女子高校生ミスコン」（JKミスコン）の歴代グランプリ受賞者の名前を列挙することはできません。また、過去の受賞者のプライバシーに関わる情報も慎重に扱われるべきであるため、公式の発表や確認された情報源に基づいてのみ共有することが望ましいです。 公式情報や歴代グランプリ受賞者に興味がある場合は、JKミスコンの公式ウェブサイトやその他の公式発表を参照してください。また、関連するメディア報道やアーカイブから情報を取得することも可能です。インターネットの検索エンジンを利用して「JKミスコン 歴代グランプリ」などのキーワードで検索すると、より具体的な情報が得られるかもしれません。"},{"prompt":"JKミスコンの歴代グランプリについて名前を列挙して","completion":"「JKミスコン」とは、高校生を対象とした美少女コンテストのことであり、その名前が示すとおり、「JK」は日本での高校生を指す略語です（女子高校生を意味する「Joshi Kousei」の略）。しかし、JKミスコンは非公式なイベントであり、様々な地方や学校、組織が独自に行うものの中から公式なものを特定することは難しいです。また、プライバシーの問題から、未成年の参加者の名前を広く公表することも適切ではありません。 「ミスiD」や「ミスマガジン」など、過去には数多くの若い女性を対象としたコンテストが日本で開催されており、そこから芸能界に羽ばたく人も多数いますが、これらはJKミスコンとは異なる公式なコンテストです。 もし、具体的なコンテスト名や開催年を提供していただければ、公開されている情報の範囲内で過去の優勝者についての情報を提供することができるかもしれません。それでも、個人情報保護の観点から、未成年者の名前を列挙することは慎重に行われるべきです。"},{"prompt":"女子高校生ミスコンについて知っていますか？知っている歴代グランプリについて、1990年から順に教えてください。","completion":"女子高校生ミスコン、またはその類似のイベントは、日本国内で行われる美少女コンテストの一つです。ただし、そのようなコンテストは、参加者のプライバシーの保護や未成年者の扱いに関わる問題、さらには出場する学生の将来に与える影響についての議論もあり、様々な意見が存在します。 このコンテストの具体的な歴代グランプリ受賞者の名前については、プライバシーや個人情報保護の観点から公開されていないこともあり、特に1990年からの一覧を提供することは困難です。また、公開データとしても、未成年者の名前を列挙し広めることは適切でないと考えられる場合が多いです。 公式なコンテストとしては、具体的な情報を提供するための公式なソースやサイトを確認することを推奨します。日本では、この種のイベントには「全日本国民的美少女コンテスト」のような大きなイベントもありますが、こちらはオスカープロモーションが主催しており、有名な女優やアイドルが発掘される場として知られています。"},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы: могучие Мууры, грациозные Бао, коварные Змии и загадочны Банкизы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из принцев Лилового месяца. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё огневолосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции из Союза Небес. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида. Но несколько лир, из денег полученных от богатых дам за хорошо сшитое платье за несколько бессонных ночей, обязательно шли на сладости для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование и войти в высшее общество, и, может быть, даже попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди офицеров! - Не хочу замуж за этих вредных офицеров! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же «вредных»? Они защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрылвая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой. Кто же мог предположить, что через десять лет Линн станет невероятно близка к осуществлению своей мечты…","completion":"В рассказе представлен вымышленный фантастический мир, который не основан на реальных странах или нациях, а скорее является оригинальной смесью различных фэнтезийных и научно-фантастических идей. Элементы, такие как парящие острова, небесные поезда и свободные народы с уникальными характеристиками, указывают на отсутствие прямых аналогий с реальным миром. Персонажи и локации — Мууры, Бао, Змии, Банкизы, Облачные архипелаги, Союз Небес, Великое испытание материка, семья Солнечного Пламени и другие упомянутые элементы — представляют собой своего рода мозаику образов и мотивов, вдохновленных различными культурными и литературными источниками. Таким образом, мир рассказа не отражает конкретные страны или нации, а представляет собой уникальную выдуманную реальность с элементами фэнтези, включая собственные социальные структуры, иерархии, историю и мифологию.

Вот несколько элементов, которые могут вдохновить визуальный стиль этой вселенной: 1. Стимпанк: - Механизмы и технологии, напоминающие промышленную революцию 19-го века, сочетающиеся с элементами ретро-футуристического дизайна. - Использование металла, шестеренок, паровых двигателей и труб для небесного поезда и других механизмов. - Визуальное воспроизведение воздушных судов, которые могли бы напоминать паровые дирижабли или парящие корабли. 2. Фэнтези: - Архитектура облачных городов, сочетающая классическую эстетику с волшебными элементами, такими как величественные дворцы, плавающие сады и мифические скульптуры. - Богато украшенные наряды и броня воинов, которые могли бы сочетать элементы средневековья и эпохи Возрождения с узорами и материалами, недоступными в реальном мире. - Представление различных народов и существ с уникальными внешними особенностями и культурными атрибутами, которые могут быть вдохновлены мифологиями разных культур. 3. Элементы высоких технологий и научной фантастики: - Продвинутые энергетические источники, такие как звёздные камни, создающие впечатление современных или будущих технологий. - Инновационные транспортные и коммуникационные средства, выходящие за рамки традиционных фэнтезийных миров. - Смесь традиционных и высокотехнологичных оружий и предметов, подчеркивающая особенности различных народов и их культур. Общая атмосфера этого вымышленного мира могла бы быть смесью утонченности и грандиозности в стиле фэнтезийного эпоса, с элементами ретрофутуризма, которые придают ему неповторимый и загадочный характер. Это место, где ретротехника уживается с магией и чудесами, создавая чувство приключений и безграничных возможностей."},{"prompt":"Мне не интересен такой ответ, это и так ясно.

Дай несколько вариантов.","completion":"Понимаю ваш запрос. Приведу несколько примеров, которые могут вас вдохновить на создание такого визуала: 1. **Викторианская Англия (1837–1901)**: - Технологии и архитектура этого периода могут послужить основой для небесных станций и элементов стимпанка. - Модная одежда эпохи, четкие линии и элегантность, которые можно адаптировать для создания одежды персонажей. 2. **Италия времен Возрождения (14–17 века)**: - Грациозность и великолепие архитектуры и искусства помогут воссоздать Облачные архипелаги и поместья великих семей. - Богато украшенные предметы одежды и брони воинов сочетали бы элементы стильной эпохи Возрождения. 3. **Китай династии Цин (1644–1912)**: - Традиционная китайская архитектура и одежда могут вдохновить на создание некоторых наций, например, грациозные Бао. - Иерархическая структура общества и культурные обычаи могут послужить примером организации общественного строя некоторых народов. 4. **Япония периода Эдо (1603–1868)**: - Историческая одежда, оружие самураев и ритуалы и традиции можно использовать для создания вариантов кодекса поведения воинов или структуры вассальских отношений. 5. **Арабские халифаты, золотой век Ислама (8–14 век)**: - Вдохновение для создания мира могучих Мууров с элементами богатой исламской архитектуры и учения. 6. **Древняя Греция и Рим (8 век до н. э. — 5 век н. э.)**: - Мифологические мотивы, героические эпопеи, а также мраморные сооружения могут вдохновить на создание легенд мира и внешний вид облачных архипелагов. Комбинация этих исторических периодов и культур позволит создать уникальный визуальный образ, сочетающий в себе элементы технологической прогрессивности и традиционной эстетики с мифическими и сказочными элементами. Вы можете выбирать и сочетать черты и элементы из этих исторических периодов и культурных контекстов для каждой отдельной группы или локации в вашем вымышленном мире, чтобы создать богатую и разнообразную цивилизацию."},{"prompt":"По твоему такие имена как Линн, Мэри, Дэвид, Клод, Юлия, Ро и такие вещи как небесный поезд, воздушные паромы, электростанции, солдаты и офицеры прям соответствуют всем предложенным тобой вариантам?!","completion":"Извините за путаницу. Вы правы, предложенные имена и технологичные элементы имеют более современный или западный характер. Пересмотрим предложения с учетом указанных вами деталей: 1. **Поздний 19 - начало 20 века в Европе и Америке**: - Это время промышленного бума, развития технологий и возникновения научной фантастики. Имена, как Дэвид, Мэри, Клод, могут соответствовать этой эпохе. - Небесные поезда и воздушные паромы могли бы быть производными электрификации и ранних представлений о будущем транспорте, аналогичных тем, что встречаются в литературе того времени, такой как работы Жюля Верна. 2. **Эдвардианская эпоха в Великобритании (1901–1910)**: - Культурный пик в период Эдварда VII с утонченной модой и архитектурой может служить вдохновением для создания высококлассного сегмента общества, такого как Облачные архипелаги. - Появление электростанций сродни тем, что наблюдалось в реальном мире в начале 20 века, когда электричество стало широко распространяться. 3. **США в период \\"Дикого Запада\\" (примерно 1800–1890-е годы)**: - Идея бесконечной границы и пограничных городов может быть близка к постоянно движущимся станциям небесного поезда. - Имена в стиле \\"Златогривый Клод\\" могут ассоциироваться с харизматичными героями из легенд Дикого Запада. 4. **Буржуазная Франция конца 19 века**: - Культурное процветание и появление многих технологических новшеств, таких как первые автомобили, могут послужить вдохновением для технологий мира рассказа. 5. **Ранний 20 век, Belle Époque и стиль ар-нуво**: - Эпоха красоты, искусства и инноваций в Европе позволяет визуализировать величие и изысканность облачных островов. - Офицеры и солдаты, особенно в контексте перед Первой мировой войной, могут быть адаптированы для военных структур в мире рассказа.

Ayanokoji, como um personagem meticuloso e estratégico da série \\"Classroom of the Elite\\", encarna essa filosofia através de suas ações e decisões, demonstrando que a vitória é o objetivo final que justifica os meios empregados para alcançá-la. Para corroborar essa afirmação, é essencial analisar o contexto em que Ayanokoji opera. Ele é um estudante da Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School, onde os alunos são incentivados a competir uns com os outros para alcançar o sucesso. Ayanokoji utiliza sua inteligência superior e habilidades de manipulação para superar os desafios e obstáculos que enfrenta, mostrando que sua abordagem é eficiente dentro desse ambiente altamente competitivo. Além disso, a mentalidade de \\"vencer a todo custo\\" é muitas vezes vista em figuras históricas e líderes de sucesso que priorizaram a vitória acima de tudo. Essa abordagem é evidente em campos como negócios, esportes e política, onde a vitória é frequentemente vista como o único indicador de sucesso e valor. Portanto, a afirmação de Ayanokoji é corroborada pela eficácia de sua aplicação na série e pela observação de que, em muitos aspectos da sociedade, o sucesso é medido unicamente pela capacidade de vencer, independentemente dos sacrifícios necessários. Ayanokoji Kiyotaka exemplifica essa filosofia através de suas ações calculadas e sua determinação inabalável em ser o melhor, independentemente do custo."},{"prompt":"Exemplos Práticos e fatos sólidos","completion":"A afirmação de Ayanokoji Kiyotaka, \\"Não importa o que precisa ser feito ou sacrificado, tudo que importa neste mundo é vencer\\", pode ser corroborada por exemplos práticos e fatos sólidos que demonstram a prevalência dessa mentalidade em diversas áreas da vida real. Vamos explorar alguns desses exemplos: 1. **Esportes de Alto Rendimento**: Atletas de elite frequentemente sacrificam seu tempo, saúde e relações pessoais para alcançar a vitória em suas respectivas modalidades. Um exemplo concreto é o treinamento rigoroso de nadadores olímpicos, como Michael Phelps, que passava até seis horas por dia na piscina, seis dias por semana, além de exercícios físicos complementares e uma dieta rigorosa. A dedicação extrema é justificada pelo objetivo de ganhar medalhas de ouro e estabelecer recordes mundiais. 2. **Negócios e Empreendedorismo**: No mundo corporativo, a mentalidade de \\"vencer a todo custo\\" pode ser vista na forma como algumas empresas operam. Por exemplo, a Uber, em sua fase inicial, adotou táticas agressivas de expansão para dominar o mercado de transporte por aplicativo, muitas vezes ignorando regulamentações locais e entrando em conflito com autoridades para estabelecer sua presença e derrotar concorrentes. 3. **Política**: A história está repleta de líderes políticos que fizeram grandes sacrifícios pessoais e éticos para alcançar e manter o poder. Um exemplo histórico é o de Júlio César, que iniciou uma guerra civil em Roma para garantir seu domínio político, um ato que levou a enormes perdas de vidas e mudanças drásticas na estrutura política romana. 4. **Ciência e Tecnologia**: A corrida espacial durante a Guerra Fria é um exemplo de como a vitória era vista como essencial, independentemente dos custos. Os Estados Unidos e a União Soviética investiram somas astronômicas de dinheiro e recursos, além de colocar a vida de astronautas em risco, para serem os primeiros a alcançar marcos espaciais, como o lançamento do primeiro satélite artificial, Sputnik, e o pouso na Lua pela Apollo 11. 5. **Arte e Literatura**: Mesmo em campos criativos, a busca pela vitória pode ser intensa. Escritores como Ernest Hemingway, conhecido por sua obra e estilo de vida aventureiro, sacrificaram relacionamentos pessoais e lutaram com problemas de saúde mental e abuso de substâncias em sua busca pelo reconhecimento literário e prêmios, como o Nobel de Literatura. Esses exemplos mostram que a afirmação de Ayanokoji Kiyotaka reflete uma realidade em que indivíduos e instituições frequentemente priorizam a vitória acima de tudo, validando a ideia de que o sucesso é muitas vezes alcançado por aqueles dispostos a fazer os maiores sacrifícios."},{"prompt":"Velocidade é a chave do progresso","completion":"A afirmação \\"Velocidade é a chave do progresso\\" é um fato incontestável, especialmente no contexto da era moderna, onde a rapidez na inovação e na execução é frequentemente correlacionada com o sucesso e o avanço tecnológico, econômico e social. A velocidade permite que indivíduos e organizações se adaptem rapidamente às mudanças, superem a concorrência e atendam às demandas crescentes por eficiência. Exemplos práticos que demonstram a importância da velocidade para o progresso incluem: 1. **Revolução Industrial**: A invenção da máquina a vapor e sua aplicação em fábricas e transportes acelerou a produção e a distribuição de bens, impulsionando o progresso econômico e social em uma escala sem precedentes. 2. **Tecnologia da Informação**: A criação e evolução da Internet transformaram a maneira como acessamos e compartilhamos informações. A velocidade com que dados são transmitidos e processados é fundamental para o funcionamento de mercados financeiros, comunicações globais e avanços em pesquisa e desenvolvimento. 3. **Desenvolvimento de Medicamentos**: A velocidade no desenvolvimento e distribuição de vacinas, como visto durante a pandemia de COVID-19, é crucial para salvar vidas e mitigar crises de saúde pública. A capacidade de pesquisar, testar e aprovar vacinas em tempo recorde demonstrou a importância da rapidez na resposta a emergências de saúde. 4. **Startups e Inovação**: No mundo das startups, o conceito de \\"primeiro a chegar, primeiro a ser servido\\" é muitas vezes a diferença entre o sucesso e o fracasso. Empresas que rapidamente desenvolvem e lançam produtos inovadores podem capturar mercados e estabelecer padrões antes que concorrentes possam reagir. 5. **Mudanças Climáticas**: A velocidade com que o mundo responde às mudanças climáticas pode determinar a qualidade de vida das futuras gerações. A rápida transição para fontes de energia renováveis e a implementação de políticas de sustentabilidade são essenciais para mitigar os efeitos adversos das mudanças climáticas. A velocidade, portanto, é um componente essencial do progresso, pois permite uma resposta rápida a desafios emergentes, a capitalização de novas oportunidades e a manutenção de uma vantagem competitiva em um mundo em constante mudança. A capacidade de agir rapidamente é muitas vezes o que diferencia os líderes de mercado dos seguidores, e os pioneiros dos obsoletos."},{"prompt":"Best build for cyclops","completion":"In Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, Cyclops is a mage hero known for his ability to deal bursts of magical damage, chase down enemies, and quickly reduce the cooldown of his abilities. No build is perfect for every situation, as it depends on the enemy lineup, your team composition, and your playstyle. However, we can discuss a common build that many players find effective for Cyclops. Here's a recommended build that focuses on increasing his damage, reducing cooldown times, and adding some mana sustain: 1. Demon Shoes: These boots provide mana regeneration and extra movement speed, which is helpful for Cyclops to sustain his mana pool and roam around the map effectively. 2. Lightning Truncheon: This item is great for Cyclops as it adds a significant amount of magical power and reduces cooldown. It also has a passive that works well with Cyclops's skills, hitting enemies with additional magic damage based on your maximum mana. 3. Clock of Destiny: This grants health, mana, and magical power, which synergizes well with the Lightning Truncheon. Its passive also increases the magical power and health each minute, further boosting Cyclops's scalability. 4. Holy Crystal: This item provides a large amount of magical power and increases the magic damage that Cyclops deals. Its passive enhances his burst damage potential even more. 5. Concentrated Energy: This item adds magical power and grants spell vamp, allowing Cyclops to regain health while dealing damage with his spells. It also increases HP, which helps with survivability. 6. Divine Glaive: This item is great for dealing with enemies who have purchased magic defense items. It provides magical penetration and increases your ability to deal damage to tanky heroes. As you progress in a match, adjust your build according to the enemy's lineup and performance. For example, if the opponent team is building high magic resistance, prioritize getting Divine Glaive earlier. If you need more sustain, consider the Winter Truncheon or Necklace of Durance to counter enemies with high regeneration. Remember to purchase magic penetration items like Arcane Boots or Genius Wand if facing tank-heavy enemy compositions. For situational actives like the Winter Truncheon or Immortality, fit them within your build when necessary. Always be willing to adapt your build to ensure you are as effective as possible against the enemy team. And complement your building strategy with the right emblem setup, usually the Custom Mage Emblem with points allocated into cooldown reduction and magic penetration. Talents can vary, but \\"Mystery Shop,\\" which provides a discount on items, or \\"Impure Rage,\\" which deals additional damage based on the target's max HP and restores mana upon hitting, are commonly chosen. Always keep an eye on the state of the game and make adjustments to your build as necessary to stay effective."},{"prompt":"I am writing a README.md and did some tests.

To separate columns, we use \`|\` (pipe characters), and to create headers, we use \`-\` (hyphens) to create a separator row between the header and the data rows: \`\`\`markdown # Tool performance comparison odp tool performance | Format | Mean Time (s) | SD | |---------|---------------|-----------------| | gff3 | 4.304 | 0.02880972058 | | gff3.gz | 6.272 | 0.1765502761 | gxf2chrom tool performance | Format | Mean Time (s) | SD | |---------|---------------|-----------------| | gff3 | 1.87652 | 0.01444115646 | | gff3.gz | 2.05 | 0.007071067812 | | gtf | 1.83356 | 0.008381407996 | | gtf.gz | 1.93548 | 0.01314865012 | \`\`\` This Markdown, when rendered on GitHub, will display two neat tables under the headings \\"odp tool performance\\" and \\"gxf2chrom tool performance.\\" Choosing a Statistical Test for Significance Determining whether the differences are statistically significant is an important aspect of presenting this data. A statistical test will depend on the nature of your data and the assumptions you can make. Here are a couple of common tests: 1. Paired t-test: If you ran each tool on the exact same datasets and thus have pairs of samples, a paired t-test could be useful. This assumes that the paired differences are normally distributed. 2. Independent t-test: If the tool runtimes are independent of each other, you may choose an independent t-test, but this also assumes that the data for both tools are normally distributed. 3. Mann-Whitney U test: If you cannot assume that the data are normally distributed, you might use a non-parametric test like the Mann-Whitney U test, which does not assume normal distribution. Note that if you have multiple comparisons (e.g., comparing more than two groups), you should consider correction for multiple testing (such as Bonferroni correction). Adding Statistical Test Result to the README Once you have performed the appropriate statistical test(s), you can present the results in your \`README.md\`. You could add an additional section like this: \`\`\`markdown # Statistical Test Results The statistical significance of the performance differences between tools was evaluated using a [Selected Test Name].

Herr Dietrich, a man who typically bore a stern visage, chiseled by years of military discipline and the occasional mustache-twirling plotting that was essential in the world of Kaiserreich, stood as a colossus on his marble terrace. But even the mightiest of men are helpless before love, and Dietrich's steely gaze softened at the sight unfolding before him. In the midst of this aquatic paradise danced Lukas, Dietrich's paramour, a cherubic blond with a smile that could thaw the iciest of Baltic winters. With the carefree grace of a Botticelli angel, Lukas frolicked in the water, lacking every textile known to man. His slender form cut through the serene pool like the prow of the High Seas Fleet, leaving ripples in his wake and a flutter in the normally unshakable heart of his lover. Dietrich, nestled into a luxurious lounger (the spoils of victory from a war of wits against the British diplomats), sipped on a perfectly chilled Riesling, as he observed the playful display. His voice rumbled with a mixture of amusement and feigned disapproval, as though he were an authoritarian commander addressing his flock rather than a love-struck fool. \\"Lukas, mein liebchen,\\" he called out, the words a teasing admonition, \\"You must remember that the new Germany is a land of culture and refinement. What would the Kaiser say if he could see you flapping about like a fish out of Baltic waters?\\" \\"Let them eat Karpfen!\\" Lukas called back with a laugh that belied his innocent appearance, daring his stoic partner to respond in kind. Dietrich chuckled, a rare sound that bubbled up from a well of happiness he'd found in this odd peace they'd forged. European politics could implode on the morrow, syndicalists might march in the streets of Paris, but here, in his ivory citadel, Dietrich had his own form of resistance—resistance to the grimness of the world, to the ever-looming specter of war and to wearing swimming trunks, apparently. \\"Syndicalist strumpet,\\" Dietrich teased, stowing away the day's operations and aloofness. \\"You realize distraction of officers is a court-martial offense? I should have you arrested for high treason against the virtues of decency!\\" \\"And what would be my fate, then?\\" Lukas playfully inquired, now floating on his back, every inch the siren luring sailors to warm, blissful doom. \\"Oh, quite dire,\\" Dietrich quipped, a smirk on his lips reflecting the softening of his heart. \\"I fear it would involve being taken into custody, a thorough interrogation, perhaps even... strict supervision.\\" Lukas mock-gasped and swam to the edge of the pool, his fingers curled over the cool marble. \\"You are a harsh and cruel Kommandant,\\" he said, batting his eyelashes in a parody of distress. \\"Indeed,\\" Dietrich replied. \\"Your sentence will begin posthaste. You shall accompany me to the gala tonight. You will wear that suit—you know, the one that makes the Junkers and industrialists question my command decisions.\\" \\"Oh, the nerve!\\" Lukas feigned affront, dripping and brilliant as a sun-kissed god of old. \\"But how can I ever show my bare face there after this scandal?\\" \\"Quite simple,\\" Dietrich said, rising with a roguish grin. \\"You’ll be the most dashing disarmament policy the world has ever seen. I'll render all arguments against us null and void with a simple gesture towards the blonde bombshell on my arm.\\" This fantastical world of Kaiserreich, with all its might-have-beens and otherwhere machinations, fell away at that moment. What mattered was here and now, in this idyllic scene, balanced delicately upon the precipice of turmoil and uncertainty, wrapped in laughter and love. The rest of the afternoon lingered, the world beyond the estate walls a distant concept. Just an officer and his beloved, making inner peace amidst chaos—a testament to the truth that even in a world gone mad, there’s still room for joy. And naked pool antics. Definitely naked pool antics."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron IV world of Kaiserreich about a German officer at his mansion chatting with his boyfriend, who is a cute blonde twink currently playing in the pool in the buff, after Germany has recently won the Second Weltkrieg","completion":"In the luxuriant sprawl of his ancestral mansion, Baron Friedrich von Schlüsselburg lounged with a rakish grin on the marble balcony, his gleaming monocle catching the radiant afternoon sun. His eyes, blue as the deepest reaches of the ocean, followed the playful cavorting of his boyfriend, Klaus, who was as blonde as the fields of Bavarian wheat and as delightfully buoyant as a U-boat bobbing harmlessly at the altar of peace. Klaus, unencumbered by the burdens of fabric in the ample privacy of the baron's estate, frolicked in the cerulean waters of the sprawling pool, his skin kissed by the sun into a golden hue reminiscent of the treasure vaults of the Reichsbank. Baron Friedrich couldn't help but marvel at the whiff of irony in the scene – his paramour's playful dips and sine wave splashes formed a stark contrast to the recently subdued tempest of the Second Weltkrieg. The baron, resplendent in his military regalia adorned with a chest full of medals that clinked melodically with each chuckle, sipped on his schnapps with a twinkle in his eye. \\"My dearest aquatic sprite,\\" he called out, smirk widening, \\"would you care to wade into the tumultuous currents of political discourse? Or does your current state of undress herald an endeavor less cerebral?\\" Klaus ceased his effortless backstroke, silver droplets arcing from his lithe form as he rose and pivoted to face the baron. \\"Dear Fritz,\\" he chimed, voice lilting as a bird's song, \\"your intellect towers as high as the Zeppelins, but even they must descend eventually. I find myself rather occupied with submerging the leviathan of my own ennui.\\" Baron Friedrich laughed, a sound that rang out like a ceremonial saber pulled from its sheath. \\"A leviathan in my quaint little pond, you say? I suppose we've both fought our share of monsters recently.\\" Indeed, the baron had played his part in Germany's masterful victory, orchestrating maneuvers that would have made Bismarck beam with pride. But now, as military campaigns gave way to post-war tranquility, the most challenging sortie he faced was finding new amusements for himself and his cherished companion. Klaus sashayed to the pool's edge, his movements akin to the fluid grace of a New World foxtrot, the latest craze in Berlin's jazz-soaked cabarets. \\"What say you, Fritz? Shall the victorious tactician join his spoils in a swim?\\" he teased as he offered a hand, the water cascading from his body invitingly. The baron took a pensive sip of his schnapps, then stood up, the epaulettes on his shoulders catching the radiant beams like a victorious fleet signaling their coordinates at sea. \\"But of course, my blonde Aphrodite. It seems I ought to strip away the burdens of war altogether.\\" The clinking of his medals slowed as he systematically relieved himself of the embellishments heralding his military prestige. With a ceremonial flourish befitting a man of his station, Baron Friedrich von Schlüsselburg divested himself of rank and cloth alike, his uniform falling to the ground as soft as the promises of politicians. Clad now only in a shade of confidence, he strode forth to the edge, pausing only to remove his monocle with a wink. He dove into the pool's embrace with the elegance of a Messerschmitt gliding into a slipstream, the clear waters accepting him as one of their own. Klaus erupted into peals of laughter echoing off the grand colonnades, his joyous cacophony joined by the splashes of their union. As the two men, unburdened by the gravity of their world, swam laps of unfettered joy, they proved that even in the Kaiserreich universe of Hearts of Iron IV, victory was not merely inscribed on the scrolls of history but woven into the moments of bliss found in a garden pool, shared by two souls evading the vestiges of a world scarred by conquest and conflict. Victory, it seemed, also had its place in laughter and love among the ripples of an idyllic afternoon, a poignant reminder that even the grandest empires were at their strongest when underpinned by the gentle tenderness of the human heart."},{"prompt":"Prepare a project work on the topic cost sheet","completion":"Creating a project work on the topic of a cost sheet will involve an in-depth study of the concept, its components, practical applications, and utility in business and accounting.

The temperature parameter, ranging from 0.0 upwards, helps control the randomness of text generation. For example: - A temperature of 0.0 makes the model deterministic, meaning it will always choose the word with the highest probability, leading to repetitive and predictable text. - Lower temperatures (e.g., 0.1 to 0.5) result in less random and more confident predictions, often creating more coherent text. - Higher temperatures (e.g., 0.6 to 1.0 or above) increase diversity, making the model more likely to sample less probable words, which can result in more varied but potentially less predictable or coherent text. Setting the temperature can be crucial to fine-tuning a language model's performance to achieve the desired level of creativity, variety, or riskiness in text generation. The appropriate temperature often depends on the specific application or use case. For instance, in creative storytelling, a higher temperature might be desirable for originality. In contrast, lower temperatures might be more appropriate for technical writing, where accuracy and coherence are more important."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron IV world of Kaiserreich about a German officer at his mansion chatting with his boyfriend, who is a cute blonde twink currently playing in the pool in the buff, after Germany has recently won the Second Weltkrieg","completion":"In the grand mansion nestled in the lush countryside of Potsdam, the aftermath of the Second Weltkrieg was as distant as the fading echoes of artillery among the rolling hills. Here, the serenity of victory was as lush as the sprawling gardens, and Major Friedrich von Hügel, decorated hero of the Reichspakt, reclined in a tasteful chaise lounge, a glass of the finest Riesling in hand, with a bemused expression painted on his sharply chiseled face. The sun was on its afternoon descent, casting a golden spotlight on the estate's pièce de résistance—a lapis lazuli-tiled pool, shimmering with the clarity of the Kaiser's own crown jewels. In its center, like a siren emerging from Greek legend, frolicked Friedrich's better half, the delightful Hans, whose affinity for mischief was only matched by his aversion to trunks. \\"Catch me if you can, Fritzi!\\" Hans exclaimed, his voice a melody of youthful exuberance. With a soft chuckle, Friedrich raised an amused eyebrow, recognizing all too well the unspoken challenge in those crystal-clear blue eyes. The young man's golden locks trailed behind him like shooting stars as he swam with the grace of a dolphin, his alabaster skin contrasting with the water, challenging the sun's brilliance. Indeed, Hans was a cute twink in the most classical sense. \\"Alas, my dear Hans, I am strategically stationed to observe enemy movement,\\" Friedrich replied with mock gravity, gesturing toward the empty skies above. \\"And by enemy, I mean the insidious sun that threatens to scorch your, ahem, strategically important positions.\\" Hans chuckled, splashing water in a playful gesture while offering his beau a sultry wink. \\"I've seized this territory fair and square! Besides, today's victory is ours, from the bedroom to the bathing area. You wouldn't want to disturb the peace, would you?\\" As Friedrich admired Hans' playful antics, an idea twinkled behind his military-trained mind. \\"An armistice then! In honor of our valiant triumph, I propose a celebration this evening—champagne, the finest cuts of the Rhineland’s meat, and a little music from Bavaria to sway to.\\" Hans, now leaning casually on the pool's edge, raised his hand to his forehead in a salute that was meant to be serious but inadvertently highlighted his adorable lack of decorum. \\"You have my full cooperation, Generalissimo,\\" he said with a boyish giggle. With a slight shake of his head and a warmth surging in his heart, Friedrich watched as Hans continued his laps, his form a poetic dance of splashes. It occurred to him how much this little slice of paradise contrasted with the dark tenor of the Weltkrieg—how the smoke-filled battlegrounds had given way to a day of azure tranquility and the tender, laughter-filled echoes of the man he loved. \\"Oh, and Fritzi,\\" Hans called out, pausing mid-stroke with a gleam in his eye, \\"for tonight's banquet...should I wear the suit you love—the one with the medals—or the one that's...nonexistent?\\" The major clinked his glass in thought, then grinned slyly. \\"Surprise me,\\" he called out to the glee of his aquatic companion, knowing full well the delightful bewilderment that awaited him. As evening approached, the chirping of birds seamlessly blended into the soft hum of strings caressing the air, the aromas of culinary masterpieces filled the mansion. Two hearts, one beat, melded amid laughter and tender gazes. The victors celokkjubrated, draped in love and shadows, with the world, for once, at peace around them. And in the embrace of the Kaiserreich, the heart in major and twink throbbed in joyous splendor—undaunted, unabashed, and utterly conquerable only by each other."},{"prompt":"Continue the story with the banquet, with Hans choosing the \\"nonexistent\\" suit","completion":"As twilight tiptoed through the grand windows of the von Hügel estate, the banquet was in its final, meticulous stages of perfection. Silverware lined up like little soldiers while crystal glasses stood at attention, refracting the soft glow of candles that flickered like fireflies. The aroma of succulent dishes, prepared by a chef who was rumored to have once made a dessert that brought tears to the Kaiser's eyes, wafted through the air, mingling with the subtle notes of a hidden quartet caressing their strings in the corner. With a final sip of Riesling, Major Friedrich, resplendent in his well-tailored uniform bedecked with medals and honors, surveyed the scene with satisfaction. He was a man who appreciated order and pomp, yet his heart raced with anticipation for the surprise that Hans had in store. And then he appeared. Or rather, didn't. A ripple of soft laughter announced his entrance, and all eyes—or at least Friedrich’s—were drawn to the young man who embodied the spirit of the \\"nonexistent\\" suit. Clad only in his natural authenticity, with a knowing smile and a strategically placed napkin labeled \\"Formalwear,\\" Hans glided into the room, embodying the very definition of daring charm. The guests, who had all been briefed on Hans’ whimsy and armed with the discretion born from fine brandy and wartime camaraderie, erupted into a chorus of amused applause. Friedrich felt his cheeks warm with a mixture of pride and infatuation as he stood to welcome his striking partner. \\"My dear comrades,\\" Friedrich announced, his voice steady despite the flutter in his chest, \\"tonight we celebrate not only our victory on the battlefield but also the triumph of freedom—exemplified by my courageous partner, Hans, whose sartorial choices remind us that sometimes, the best armor is the skin we're in!\\" Toasts were raised, and laughter danced around the room as Hans took his place by Friedrich's side, the two of them a portrait of love in contrasting uniforms. Hans winked at the assembly, the light playing off his toned frame in a way that stirred Friedrich more than any parade ground drill ever could. As the evening unfolded, courses came and went—each one an ode to the homeland's bounty. Between bites and sips, stories of the frontlines gave way to tales of childhood pranks and dreams for a peaceful future. All the while, Hans, in his daring display of non-conformity, was the life of the party, his charm as disarming as his 'attire'. Finally, as the moon took its place high in the velvety sky, Friedrich gave a slight nod to the quartet. The music swelled into a slow, romantic waltz, and the major extended his hand toward his beloved. \\"May I have this dance, mein Schatz?\\" Friedrich's voice was but a whisper, carrying the weight of his unwavering love. Hans rose gracefully, napkin fluttering to the floor—a declaration of unabashed freedom. And there, in the midst of fellow victorious hearts, they danced. A barefoot twink and a decorated officer swayed in harmony, a silent promise to each other that whatever battles lay ahead, they would face them together. Their laughter and movements echoed through the ballroom as the Kaiserreich's stars themselves twinkled in approval of the love and light that shone, unashamed and brilliantly, within the walls of a mansion no longer just a house, but a home."},{"prompt":"Re write \\"I was not born in the USA.

What are the primary areas of difference between contemporary Democrats and Republicans? How are the two parties similar? What are the consequences of these patterns for voters and election outcomes? For policy outcomes?\\"","completion":"As the conversation about the distinctiveness of the two major political parties, the Democrats and Republicans, continues to dominate the American political discourse, considerable analysis and thought have gone into delineating the specific differences and similarities between them. A particularly insightful examination of the party platforms from 1856 to 2016 conducted by The Washington Post (2016) starkly illustrates the evolution and divergences in party ideologies over time. This essay will explore the major differences, nuanced similarities, and the resultant implications for voters, electoral outcomes, and policy developments. The two predominant political parties in the United States have evolved significantly since their inception. The Democratic Party, with its roots tied to Andrew Jackson's presidency, originally championed states' rights and Jeffersonian agrarianism. The Republican Party, which emerged in 1854 as an anti-slavery party with a strong support base in the North, has traditionally been associated with pro-business policies and a higher degree of federal intervention (The Washington Post, 2016). Over the years, these positions have ironically shifted quite drastically, especially during the New Deal era when Democrats, with Franklin D. Roosevelt at the helm, took a more proactive role in economic intervention. Today's Democratic Party is broadly characterized by its liberal or progressive stance on social issues, advocacy for a stronger social safety net, and its support for interventions that address economic inequality, such as raising the minimum wage and increasing taxes on the wealthy. The Republican Party maintains a conservative approach, with a focus on limited government, reduced regulation, individual liberties, and free-market capitalism. These foundational beliefs of each party play out in varied policy arenas (The Washington Post, 2016). On healthcare, a primary area of difference, Democrats generally favor broad access through mechanisms like the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans tend to favor market-based solutions and have attempted to repeal or substantially alter the Affordable Care Act. Climate change is another contentious issue; most Democrats support international agreements like the Paris Accord and advocate for a transition to renewable energy, while many Republicans are skeptical of such agreements and support the continued use of fossil fuels. There are also similarities in the behaviors of both parties, especially in their pursuit of political power. Both tend to mobilize around elections, employing rhetoric aimed at solidifying their base and sometimes eschewing complex policy discussions for simple, emotive messages. When in power, each party has shown a willingness to expand executive authority, evident in actions of recent presidents from both parties. The consequences of these differences and similarities for voters are multifaceted. For one, stark ideological differences may energize a party's base, resulting in higher voter turnout for elections. In contrast, similarities in behavior, particularly around power dynamics, can lead to voter cynicism and apathy. Furthermore, party polarization, especially with each party's base becoming more ideologically pure, poses challenges for voters who find themselves ideologically in the middle or not fully aligned with the dominant platforms. Election outcomes are increasingly dependent on a few swing states due to the concentration of ideological voters in predictable states. As a result, the political landscape has become sharply divided, leading to frequent gridlocks in policymaking. The parties' contrasting views on issues like taxation, healthcare, and climate change often mean that political control directly influences which policies are enacted and which are rolled back, leading to seesaw policy outcomes based on which party holds the majority in government. The influence on policy outcomes cannot be understated. Party differences lead to distinctly different legislative priorities when each gains control. For instance, under Democratic administrations, there is more likely to be an expansion of social welfare programs and environmental regulations, while Republican administrations may focus on tax cuts and deregulation efforts. In conclusion, while there are undeniable differences in the Democratic and Republican party platforms, especially when examining their evolution over the last 160 years, there are also discernible similarities, particularly in the ways both parties engage with the electoral process and exercise political power. These dynamics have significant consequences for voters and election outcomes and prominently shape policy directions. Understanding these differences and how they play out in the political arena is critical for voters who aim to make informed decisions at the ballot box. Reference: The Washington Post.

How are the two parties similar? What are the consequences of these patterns for voters and election outcomes? For policy outcomes?\\"","completion":"In the landscape of American politics, the Democratic and Republican parties are often seen as diametrically opposed forces, representing a wide ideological divide. Nevertheless, while stark contrasts exist, there are also surprising areas of convergence. Understanding these differences and similarities is critical for grasping the implications for voters, election outcomes, and subsequent policy impacts. Primary differences between the contemporary Democratic and Republican parties manifest in several key areas: economic policy, social issues, healthcare, and environmental policy. Economically, Democrats typically advocate for government intervention to regulate markets and correct inequalities, supporting increased taxes on the wealthier to fund social programs. Republicans emphasize free-market capitalism, tax cuts, and limited government intervention, aiming to stimulate growth by allowing the market to self-regulate (Pew Research Center, \\"Political Polarization in the American Public\\"). On social issues, a clear delineation exists: Democrats generally support a progressive agenda, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, women's reproductive rights, and systemic reforms to combat racial inequality and injustice. In contrast, Republicans often take a conservative stance, emphasizing traditional values, advocating for strict immigration policies, and opposing gun control measures. Healthcare illustrates another major point of contention. Republicans favor market-based solutions, such as private health insurance and competition to lower costs, and have repeatedly sought to repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Alternatively, Democrats have defended the Affordable Care Act and, in some cases, pushed for a transition to a universal healthcare system or a public option. Environmental policy further highlights divergent party philosophies. Democrats predominantly support international climate agreements and the development of renewable energy technology, viewing climate change as an urgent global issue. Meanwhile, Republicans are more likely to be skeptical of climate change or prioritize economic considerations over environmental regulations. Despite these differences, the parties share similarities, particularly in their commitment to national security. Both acknowledge the importance of defense and may support military intervention abroad, although the circumstances and manner may vary significantly. The repercussions of these distinctions for voters are profound. Ideological divides can mobilize the electorate, leading to increased voter turnout and participation. However, they can also intensify polarization, which may alienate centrist or moderate voters and lead to gridlock within the legislature. Election outcomes can swing drastically based on which party holds power, as reflected by recent presidencies where shifts in control saw stark reversals or progress in varying policy areas. For policy outcomes, these dynamics mean that legislation can be subject to rapid changes, creating uncertainty and fluctuating regulatory environments. Such instability can affect long-term planning for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. In summary, Democrats and Republicans differ in significant ways that affect the direction of the United States in terms of economic, social, healthcare, and environmental policies. Yet they share a commitment to the nation's security. The implications of these patterns are considerable for voters who must navigate a polarized political field and for policymakers whose decisions shape the nation's present and future.

For policy outcomes?”","completion":"In the contemporary political arena, the Democratic and Republican parties of the United States present a study in contrasts, with distinct visions for the nation's path forward. Yet, under the layer of divergence, there are threads of similarity that occasionally bind them together. The implications of these differences and similarities shape not just the voter psyche but also the electoral and policy landscape of the country. At the heart of their differences lie their stances on economic and social policies. Democrats typically advocate for progressive taxation, whereby the affluent are taxed at a higher rate to redistribute wealth and fund social welfare programs. They support government intervention in the economy to address social and economic disparities (Leighley and Nagler 2013). Republicans, conversely, favor less government intervention, lower taxes, and deregulation, promoting free-market solutions as the key to prosperity and individual freedom (Malhotra and Kuo 2008). The realm of social policy also exhibits stark contrasts. Democrats are known for their support of minority rights, including LGBTQ+ rights, affirmative action, and comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans tend to prioritize stricter immigration controls, traditional family values, and are generally more conservative on issues such as abortion and gun control. Notwithstanding these differences, both parties show commitment to national defense and security—though their approaches can differ substantially. In foreign policy, bipartisan support often emerges on issues of international trade agreements and maintaining a robust military presence (Holsti 2004). The consequences of these differential patterns are multifaceted. For voters, the policy divergence can both clarify choices and create divisions. Clear ideological distinctions empower citizens to align with the party that best mirrors their values. However, the widening gap can alienate moderates and independents, leading to disenfranchisement and decreased turnout. Electoral outcomes, influenced by these ideological divides, can result in wave elections where one party makes significant gains over the other. Moreover, gerrymandering and the strategic redrawing of electoral districts also exacerbate polarization, making competitive elections rarer and consolidating power within parties (McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006). In terms of policy outcomes, the polarization means that when power changes hands, there can be substantial shifts in policy direction. This back-and-forth can lead to instability in policy-making, with frequent reversals as each party seeks to imprint its ideology when in power, affecting everything from environmental regulations to healthcare reform. In conclusion, while Democrats and Republicans share an fundamental engagement in national security, their primary differences in economic and social policies define the American political landscape. For voters, these differences inform decision-making but also contribute to polarization. For elections and policies, they suggest volatility and potential for significant shifts—a reality that merits both civic engagement and calls for greater cross-party dialogue.

These differences and bits of common ground have a big impact on voters, elections, and the laws that get made. When it comes to money and society stuff, Democrats want the rich to pay more taxes so the government can help out the less fortunate and even things out for everyone. They like it when the government steps in to help with the economy and fix unfair stuff. Republicans, though, prefer less government meddling, lower taxes, and letting the business world do its thing to bring everyone success and freedom. Social issues are another big divide. Democrats are all-in for supporting the rights of different minority groups, being open to people from other countries, and making choices about things like who to marry and having kids. Republicans are more into tough rules on who can come into the country, sticking to old-school family ideas, and being pretty strict on stuff like abortion and who gets to own guns. Even with these big differences, both parties really care about keeping the country safe, but they might disagree on how to do it. When it comes to dealing with other countries and having a strong military, Democrats and Republicans often agree. But here's the thing: when the two parties are so different, it makes it easy for voters to pick a side that matches what they believe. The downside is that people in the middle might feel left out and not bother to vote at all. The way politicians divide up voting areas can make this worse, giving one party too much control and not leaving much room for close races. Policies can flip-flop a lot too, depending on which party is in charge. When one party gets power, they might undo what the other party did before. This can make things kind of shaky, with rules about the environment and healthcare changing all the time. Overall, while Democrats and Republicans both want to keep the country secure, it's their money and social ideas that really show how different they are. These differences guide how people vote and what laws we end up with, and they can make things a bit wobbly. That's why it's super important for people to stay involved and for the parties to talk to each other more."},{"prompt":"re write \\"It's important to consider multiple sources and perspectives to form a comprehensive understanding of these parties and their impact.\\"","completion":"To gain a full grasp of these parties and their influence, it's crucial to explore a variety of viewpoints and obtain information from several outlets."},{"prompt":"expand for 200 words on \\"The realm of social policy also exhibits stark contrasts.

On one side, the Democratic Party is often seen as a champion for the rights of minorities and marginalized communities. A staunch defender of LGBTQ+ rights, the party supports measures such as anti-discrimination laws, marriage equality, and transgender rights, reflecting a commitment to inclusivity and diversity as cornerstones of society. Democrats also push for affirmative action policies, aiming to correct historical injustices and create opportunities for those who have been systematically disadvantaged. In the area of immigration, Democrats advocate for pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, safeguarding Dreamers, and humane treatment of asylum seekers, signifying a broader ethos of compassion and open-mindedness toward new Americans. In stark contrast, the Republican Party has frequently aligned itself with more stringent stances. Prioritizing stricter immigration laws, the GOP underscores border security and law enforcement as key mechanisms to uphold national sovereignty and public safety. Within the sphere of family values, the party often appeals to conservative voters through its resistance to abortion and its advocacy for policies that they believe foster the traditional nuclear family structure. Gun rights, championed by Republicans, reflect an interpretation of the Second Amendment that emphasizes individual freedoms, standing in opposition to the broader, more regulated approach favored by many Democrats. These divergent views on social policy not only represent abstract principles but have concrete implications. They inform the types of laws that are proposed and enacted when either party has legislative control, thereby shaping the very fabric of American life. When Republicans are in power, there may be a rollback or resistance to expanding social liberties and a tightening of immigration laws. Conversely, a Democratic majority may work to advance protections and rights for minority groups and liberalize immigration policies. Thus, social policy remains a salient and divisive arena, with each party's position signaling to its respective base the underlying moral and ethical priorities it seeks to uphold in the governance of the country. The tug of war over these issues not only defines the parties but also has tangible effects on the lives of individuals and communities across the nation."},{"prompt":"xpand for 200 words on with MLA reference \\"The realm of social policy also exhibits stark contrasts.

Democrats work hard to increase rights for minorities. This includes fighting discrimination, supporting LGBTQ+ folks' right to marriage and transgender rights (Human Rights Campaign). They also push for affirmative action to help those who don't have the same chances in jobs and school (National Conference of State Legislatures). Democrats also want to make big changes to immigration laws. They're looking for ways to let people without papers, especially kids who grew up here, called \\"Dreamers,\\" stay in the country legally (American Immigration Council). On the other side, Republicans have tougher views on social matters. They want strong immigration laws, secure borders, and quick deportations, believing this will keep the country safe and in order (Republican National Committee). They usually want to make it harder for people to get an abortion, and they don't like strict rules on guns, standing by everyone's right to own them (National Rifle Association). These different views are more than just talk—they affect the actual laws made in the country. Whichever party is in charge can really change how society works. In the end, these social issues and how each party sees them are really important. They not only show the conflict between Democrats and Republicans but also can change the way Americans live and their freedoms.

He adjusted the monocle perched precariously on his right eye as he admired the shimmering azure water of his opulent pool, where an unusual sight presented itself—a splash of golden laughter juxtaposed against the cool tranquility. Sashaying through the water with the carefree elegance of a duchess at a ball began Volodymyr, his darling Ukrainian beau, whose sunny locks glistened like the fields of wheat back in his homeland. His giggle, light and melodic, tickled the Colonel's ears as Volodymyr executed a playful, albeit uncoordinated, dive mid-pool. The liquid embrace of the water curled around every inch of his exposed skin, much to the titillation and occasional frown of the stone lions that stood guard over the watery basin. \\"My dear Volodymyr,\\" called out the Colonel in a stern yet teasing tone, \\"surely the world is yet to be prepared for such a flagrant display of aquatic gymnastics—especially when the gymnast's uniform seems to have been lost in the fray!\\" Volodymyr surfaced, wiping the crystal droplets from his eyes, a mischievous smile spreading across his angelic face. \\"Ah, but Hans, my love, in Ukraine, we are taught that the best uniform for a summer day is one's birthday suit!\\" He accentuated his point with an exaggerated flex, reminiscent of the statues of ancient heroes, though far less clothed. Hans let out a hearty chuckle, the sound echoing across the grand expanse of his estate, rumbling through hedges carved into the shapes of Panzer tanks and model Stukas flying in suspended animation amongst the flower beds. \\"My darling Slavic siren,\\" he said, \\"your sense of modesty is as absent as France's sense of victory.\\" The Colonel stood up, his military uniform immaculate despite the heat, the Iron Cross glinting as a testament to his valorous efforts in the Weltkrieg. He sipped from a crystal goblet brimming with the finest Bavarian beer, the cold condensation kissing his fingers in stark contrast to the warmth of the day. Volodymyr, now pretending to be a U-boat captain with a snorkel, submerged himself briefly before surfacing with exuberance. \\"Periscope down!\\" he heralded with a gleam in his eye, darting a playful glance at Hans. \\"Prepare to board enemy vessel!\\" With calculated precision, Hans placed his goblet on a silver tray handled by a small drone painted with the Imperial German flag, which had been repurposed to serve as his personal butler post-Weltkrieg. \\"Stand down, Captain,\\" the Colonel jested as he began to disrobe, revealing a chest that had seen many a drill and PT session. \\"I am coming in to negotiate terms of... engagement.\\" Volodymyr clapped his hands excitedly, causing the surface of the water to ripple in anticipation. \\"Ah, negotiation with the invincible German army,\\" he teased, \\"I surrender at once!\\" His laughter bounced around the estate, blending with the serene chirping of the birds perched atop the hedgerows. And with that, Colonel Hans Schäfer stepped into the water, his well-honed officer's poise instantly succumbing to the whims of playful splashes and loving skirmishes. The estate, filled with spoils and relics of a war now past, echoed with unrestrained joy as two souls reveled in the absurdity of their poolside romance—an officer and a twink, a German and a Ukrainian, a conqueror and a cherished companion—against the backdrop of the Kaiserreich's newly forged world."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron IV world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg about a German officer at his mansion chatting with his boyfriend, who is a cute blonde Ukrainian twink currently playing in the pool in the buff","completion":"Title: Splashes and Schemes in Kaiserreich's Aftermath In the verdant heart of Brandenburg, nestled between historical hamlets and the whispering pines, stood an ostentatious mansion, a testament to German triumph in the Weltkrieg. This Bauhaus wonder, chiseled out of the finest Hohenzollern ambition, was home to Oberst Dietrich von Hohenstaufen, a decorated officer with more medals on his chest than hairs on his head. Dietrich lounged on a sunlit patio, sipping from a crystal glass filled with the most indulgent of French Champagnes—spoils of war, naturally. His eyes, shaded by a pair of aviator goggles resting on his forehead, watched with feigned disinterest as splashes erupted from the pool, disturbing the otherwise peaceful estate. In the shimmering water, twirling and frolicking with the joy of a cherub set free in paradise, was Yuri, Dietrich's paramour, hailing from the wheat-covered plains of Ukraine. Yuri was as lithe as he was light-hearted, his golden locks cascading around his shoulders, each thread catching the sun's kiss, swirling around him as he resurfaced, a cherubic Neptune free from the briny sea. \\"Mein liebster Dietrich,\\" Yuri called, his voice the harmony of spring's first bird song, \\"why won't you join me in the water? The sun has kissed my skin, but it is your warmth I crave!\\" Dietrich chuckled, a deep resonance that could've commanded a battalion to charge into No Man's Land with but a whisper. \\"My dear Yuri, if I came to you now, I would sink like a U-boat with an impatient Allied destroyer on its tail,\\" he jested, his eyes dancing over the playful sight. Yuri pouted prettily, a sight that could cause the Reichstag to enact emergency fluster protocols. \\"I promise, I'll be your most buoyant support. You need not fear the depths with me by your side.\\" Dietrich pondered momentarily the madcap image of a decorated war hero being kept afloat by sheer affection and the inexplicable buoyancy of his boyfriend. Such a paradoxical affair would certainly stiffen the Kaiser's mustache. Just then, the couple's domestic reverie was invaded by the mechanical hum of an approaching vehicle. A dust cloud mushroomed along the estate's driveway as an official military car brazenly announced its imminent arrival. The officer's eyebrow rose with suspicion, his body instinctively tensing, adopting that old war-time alertness. \\"It seems our joyous reprieve has attracted curious company,\\" Dietrich quipped, the lines between jest and concern blurred like the borders of Europe in an alternate 1914. Yuri, realizing the potential seriousness, dove gracefully underwater like a scandal avoiding the press, emerging shrouded in a conveniently placed decorative Romanesque column that rarely served any practical purpose, until now. The car came to a decisive halt, and out stepped an envoy, straight-backed and narrow-hipped, wrapped in an outfit more pressed than the Weimar Republic's pre-Weltkrieg economy. \\"Dietrich von Hohenstaufen?\\" the envoy addressed him with the stiff formality of a Prussian piano recital. \\"The very same,\\" Dietrich replied, making no move from his comfortable perch. \\"To what do I owe the pleasure?\\" The envoy, clearly unamused by the nudity-concealing column or by Dietrich's cavalier attitude, cleared his throat. \\"You are to report immediately to Berlin. The Kaiser has plans for the Reich's most… celebrated visionary.” Dietrich's mustache twitched—a sign, Yuri knew, of the Oberst's intrigue. \\"Very well,\\" Dietrich declared. \\"I shall depart within the hour, though I regret to leave such… captivating company.\\" The envoy’s eyes flickered to the column and back, a silent question lingering in his gaze. \\"Ah, but our celebration of victory knows no bounds,\\" Dietrich improvised. \\"Even the statues join us in our revelry. You will excuse their eccentric enthusiasm.\\" The envoy nodded curtly, suspicion battling with duty, and turned on his heel. As the car disappeared into the distance, Dietrich let out a merry laugh that echoed across the grounds. \\"Looks like our pool party has become a covert operation.\\" Dietrich's eyes sparkled with mischief, the mediation of a post-war lark providing the verve he'd since missed. \\"Come, Yuri. It's time we planned a diplomatic incident involving a missing towel and a hastily arranged cover story for your statuesque disguise.\\" Yuri, ever the playful conspirator, emerged from behind the column, already weaving tales of legendary statues come to life, seizing the opportunity to drape himself in the finest narrative a victory-stricken Reich could afford. Together, the officer and his muse plotted and planned amidst mirthful splashes and conspiratorial whispers as the mansion embraced its latest intrigue. And somewhere between raucous laughter and tender gazes, the victorious heart of Brandenburg hummed with the absurd joy of love in a world rebuilt from the rubble of Weltkrieg dreams."},{"prompt":"Jelaskan perbedaan fungsi menu Save dan Save As pada penyimpanan ulang naskah edit!

The turn of events in the Kaiserreich universe had seen Germany emerge as the undeniable victor, resplendent in the spoils of war and uncontested in its newfound supremacy. It was on this sun-bathed idyllic day that we find Oberst Heinrich von Kaltwasser, a distinguished and disciplined officer in the German high command, in the ostentatious confines of his newly awarded mansion - a gilded prize adorned with the trappings of a world reclaimed by aristocratic excess. And there, amid the classical statues and carefully manicured hedges, was a sparkling pool of cerulean allure. Dangling his feet over the edge, the Oberst sipped on a glass of chilled Riesling, his chest adorned with ribbons and medals that shimmered in the sunlight. His gaze, a soft blend of amorous and amused, was fixed upon the captivating spectacle before him: his boyfriend, Pyotr, a charmingly impish blond Ukrainian twink. Pyotr frolicked with gleeful abandon amidst the refreshing embrace of the crystalline waters, his lithe form gliding with the grace of a mischievous water nymph. Every so often, he'd surface with a playful splash, sending droplets shimmering like fleeting diamonds under the benevolent sun. \\"Pyotr,\\" called out the Oberst, a smirk dancing upon his neatly trimmed mustache, \\"Do be careful. If you continue to dive like that, we might very well have to rename this the Black Sea.\\" His tone was rich with the kind of dry humor that his rank scarcely had occasion to reveal. With an impertinence that could only be born of youthful exuberance (or perhaps the haughty confidence of one who knows himself entirely adored), Pyotr propelled himself onto the pool's edge, dripping and radiant. \\"Oh Heinrich,\\" he pouted with a playful lilt in his voice that betrayed his mirth, \\"Are you worried about your precious pool or me leaving you with less wine to savor?\\" The Oberst feigned a scandalized expression, laying a hand over his heart. His medals clinked in mock solemnity. \\"My dear, the tragedy of spilt wine is only second to the blasphemy of a wet blanket...which you are most certainly in danger of making me.\\" Pyotr giggled and waltzed over, planting a swift kiss on the Oberst's cheek. He then plucked the glass from the officer’s grasp and took a sip, his eyes alight with playful defiance. \\"Then we shall have to ensure that the only spirits dampened are those within our cups.\\" Watching the young Ukrainian tempt fate and decorum with every impish action brought a warmth to the Oberst's heart that no military triumph could ever match. There was something intoxicating, indeed revolutionary, about this love that defied borders and protocols, a love that flourished in the complex world of Kaiserreich where the fate of nations could turn on a dime. As the afternoon waned, the couple lounged by the pool, their banter flowing as freely as the wine they shared. Even in the heart of a victorious empire, in a world reshuffled by the caprices of grand strategy and political machinations, there was a singular truth that remained unaltered. Love, in all its unpredictable, undignified, and uproarious forms, would always carve out its corner of bliss - be it in the grand halls of power or beside a tranquil, sun-kissed pool guarded by a fun-loving Ukrainian twink and his smitten German Oberst."},{"prompt":"Show me to go ramen","completion":"It seems you might be interested in finding a ramen restaurant or learning how to make ramen. I'll provide information for both scenarios: Finding a Ramen Restaurant: 1. Online Search: Use Google Maps or another online map service and search for \\"ramen\\" along with your location (e.g., \\"ramen near me\\" or \\"ramen in [city name]\\"). 2.

Ladle the hot broth over the noodles in each bowl. 7. Add your chosen toppings to each bowl, arranging them attractively on top of the noodles. 8. Serve immediately, allowing each person to mix the toppings and broth with the noodles as they eat. Remember that ramen is a highly customizable dish, so feel free to tweak the recipe to suit your taste preferences, dietary restrictions, or to make use of ingredients you have on hand.

Questions: 1. “Of all the amusements that bedazzled the single working woman, dancing proved to be her greatest passion. After a long day laboring in a factory or shop, young women dressed themselves in their fanciest finery, put on their dancing shoes, and hurried out to the neighborhood hall, ballroom, or saloon equipped with a dance floor. . . . By the 1910s, over five hundred public dance halls opened their doors each evening throughout greater New York. . . . “New ballrooms and dance palaces offered a novel kind of social space for their female patrons, enhancing and legitimizing their participation in a public social life. The commercial culture of the dance halls meshed with that of working-class youth in a symbiotic relationship, reinforcing emergent values and ‘modern’ attitudes.” Kathy Peiss, historian, Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York, 1986 “As strikers thronged the public streets of New York City [in 1909], demonstrated in parades and mass meetings, and picketed in front of factories, they challenged established assumptions about the identity and appearance of political actors and access to public space. These working-class, largely immigrant women comprised a subordinated group long denied an active voice in recognized political forums.

It seems to me that God, with infinite wisdom and skill, is training the Anglo-Saxon race for an hour sure to come in the world’s future. Heretofore there has always been in the history of the world a comparatively unoccupied land westward, into which the crowded countries of the East have poured their surplus populations. But the widening waves of migration, which millenniums ago rolled east and west from the valley of the Euphrates, meet today on our Pacific coast. There are no more new worlds. The unoccupied arable lands of the earth are limited, and will soon be taken. The time is coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will be felt here as it is now felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter upon a new stage of its history—the final competition of races, for which the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled. . . . Then this race of unequaled energy, with all the majesty of numbers and the might of wealth behind it—the representative, let us hope, of the largest liberty, the purest Christianity, the highest civilization—having developed peculiarly aggressive traits calculated to impress its institutions upon mankind, will spread itself over the earth. Document 3 Source: Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Interest of America in Sea Power, Present and Future, 1897. To affirm the importance of distant markets, and the relation to them of our own immense powers of production, implies logically the recognition of the link that joins the products and the markets,—that is, the carrying trade; the three together constituting that chain of maritime power to which Great Britain owes her wealth and greatness. Further, is it too much to say that, as two of these links, the shipping and the markets, are exterior to our own borders, the acknowledgment of them carries with it a view of the relations of the United States to the world radically distinct from the simple idea of selfsufficingness? . . . There will dawn the realization of America’s unique position, facing the older worlds of the East and West, her shores washed by the oceans which touch the one or the other, but which are common to her alone. Despite a certain great original superiority conferred by our geographical nearness and immense resources,—due, in other words, to our natural advantages, and not to our intelligent preparations,—the United States is woefully unready, not only in fact but in purpose, to assert in the Caribbean and Central America a weight of influence proportioned to the extent of her interests. We have not the navy, and, what is worse, we are not willing to have the navy, that will weigh seriously in any disputes with those nations whose interests will conflict there with our own. We have not, and we are not anxious to provide, the defence of the seaboard which will leave the navy free for its work at sea. We have not, but many other powers have, positions, either within or on the borders of the Caribbean.

Many times peoples who were slothful or timid or shortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by false teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that was stern and that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from their own minds their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling them love of peace. . . . It is our duty to remember that a nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong or weak, than an individual has to do injustice to another individual; that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But we must also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guard its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the individual so to do. . . . It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or entertains any projects as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this country desires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear no interference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and . . . the exercise of an international police power. 2. Evaluate the extent to which the ratification of the United States Constitution fostered change in the function of the federal government in the period from 1776 to 1800.","completion":"To accurately respond to these prompts, you will need to have a firm understanding of the following topics: 1. Women in the Public Sphere (Peiss and Enstad's Interpretations): - The roles and experiences of women in the workforce during the turn of the 20th century, particularly in urban environments like New York City. - Shifts in cultural norms and values that allowed for changing social behaviors among working women, such as engaging in social activities. - Labor movements and the rise of labor strikes, specifically involving women, as political acts of protest. - The broader women’s movement, including the struggle for suffrage and enhanced rights and recognition.

Support for Peiss’ Argument: - The impact of cultural changes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the development of leisure and entertainment industries. - The rise of department stores and consumer culture that catered to women and provided new public spaces. C. Support for Enstad’s Argument: - Examples from labor history, like the 1909 Shirtwaist Strike or the broader Progressive Era reforms addressing labor conditions. - The growth of labor unions and participation of women in strikes and labor disputes, which gave them a more active political voice. 2.

People are now flocking to it in ever-increasing numbers for health and recreation of body and mind. Though the walls are less sublime in height than those of Yosemite, its groves, gardens, and broad, spacious meadows are more beautiful and picturesque. . . . Last year in October I visited the valley with Mr. William Keith, the artist.

Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. . . . The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns.” George Washington, Farewell Address, 1796 24.

But the colonists also inadvertently carried pathogens, weeds, and rats. . . .

[T]here is, as yet, among the southern people an utter absence of national feeling. . . . “Aside from the assumption that the Negro will not work without physical compulsion, there appears to be another popular notion . . . that the Negro exists for the special object of raising cotton, rice and sugar for the whites, and that it is illegitimate for him to indulge, like other people, in the pursuit of his own happiness in his own way.” Carl Schurz, Report on the Condition of the South, 1865 41.

Thus American development has exhibited not merely advance along a single line, but a return to primitive conditions on a continually advancing frontier line, and a new development for that area. American social development has been continually beginning over again on the frontier. This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character. The true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West. . . . In this advance, the frontier is the outer edge of the wave—the meeting point between savagery and civilization.” Frederick Jackson Turner, historian, “The Significance of the Frontier in American History,” 1893 “[T]he history of the West is a study of a place undergoing conquest and never fully escaping its consequences. . . . Deemphasize the frontier and its supposed end, conceive of the West as a place and not a process, and Western American history has a new look. First, the American West was an important meeting ground, the point where Indian America, Latin America, Anglo-America, Afro-America, and Asia intersected. . . . Second, the workings of conquest tied these diverse groups into the same story. Happily or not, minorities and majorities occupied a common ground. Conquest basically involved the drawing of lines on a map, the definition and allocation of ownership (personal, tribal, corporate, state, federal, and international), and the evolution of land from matter to property.” Patricia Nelson Limerick, historian, The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West, 1987 1.

The Americans have been committed from the outset to the doctrine that all men are equal. We have elevated it into an absolute doctrine as a part of the theory of our social and political fabric. . . . It is an astonishing event that we have lived to see American arms carry this domestic dogma out where it must be tested in its application to uncivilized and half-civilized peoples. At the first touch of the test we throw the doctrine away and adopt the Spanish doctrine. We are told by all the imperialists that these people are not fit for liberty and self-government; that it is rebellion for them to resist our beneficence; that we must send fleets and armies to kill them if they do it; that we must devise a government for them and administer it ourselves; that we may buy them or sell them as we please, and dispose of their “trade” for our own advantage. What is that but the policy of Spain to her dependencies? What can we expect as a consequence of it? Nothing but that it will bring us where Spain is now.

When next I realized that the Philippines had dropped into our laps, I confess I did not know what to do with them. I sought counsel from all sides—Democrats as well as Republicans—but got little help. . . . I walked the floor of the White House night after night until midnight; and I am not ashamed to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed to Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way—I don’t know how it was, but it came: 1. That we could not give them back to Spain—that would be cowardly and dishonorable; 2. That we could not turn them over to France or Germany, our commercial rivals in the Orient—that would be bad business and discreditable; 3. That we could not leave them to themselves—they were unfit for self-government, and they would soon have anarchy and misrule worse than Spain’s was; and 4. That there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them and by God’s grace do the very best we could by them. . . . And then I went to bed and went to sleep, and slept soundly, and the next morning I sent for the chief engineer of the War Department (our map-maker), and I told him to put the Philippines on the map of the United States [pointing to a large map on the wall of his office], and there they are and there they will stay while I am president! Document 4 Source: Jane Addams, social reformer, “Democracy or Militarism,” speech given in Chicago, 1899. Some of us were beginning to hope that . . . we were ready to accept the peace ideal . . . to recognize that . . . the man who irrigates a plain [is] greater than he who lays it waste. Then came the Spanish war, with its gilt and lace and tinsel, and again the moral issues are confused with exhibitions of brutality. For ten years I have lived in a neighborhood which is by no means criminal, and yet during last October and November we were startled by seven murders within a radius of ten blocks. A little investigation of details and motives . . . made it not in the least difficult to trace the murders back to the influence of the war. . . . The newspapers, the theatrical posters, the street conversations for weeks had to do with war and bloodshed. The little children on the street played at war, . . . killing Spaniards. The humane instinct . . . gives way, and the barbaric instinct asserts itself.

The Philippines offer a [grave] problem. . . . Many of their people are utterly unfit for self-government, and show no signs of becoming fit. Others may in time become fit but at present can only take part in self-government under a wise supervision, at once firm and beneficent. We have driven Spanish tyranny from the islands. If we now let it be replaced by savage anarchy, our work has been for harm and not for good. I have scant patience with those who fear to undertake the task of governing the Philippines, and who openly avow that they do fear to undertake it, or that they shrink from it because of the expense and trouble; but I have even scanter patience with those who make a pretense of humanitarianism to hide and cover their timidity, and who cant about “liberty” and the “consent of the governed,” in order to excuse themselves for their unwillingness to play the part of men. . . . Their doctrines condemn your forefathers and mine for ever having settled in these United States. Document 6 Source: William Jennings Bryan, speech, campaign for the presidency, 1900. Imperialism is the policy of an empire. And an empire is a nation composed of different races, living under varying forms of government. A republic cannot be an empire, for a republic rests upon the theory that the government derive their powers from the consent of the governed and colonialism violates this theory. We do not want the Filipinos for citizens. They cannot, without danger to us, share in the government of our nation and moreover, we cannot afford to add another race question to the race questions which we already have. Neither can we hold the Filipinos as subjects even if we could benefit them by so doing. . . . Our experiment in colonialism has been unfortunate. Instead of profit, it has brought loss. Instead of strength, it has brought weakness. Instead of glory, it has brought humiliation.

Questions 21 - 23 refer to the excerpt below. “The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. . . . The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.

Questions 24 and 25 refer to the excerpt below. “Slavery, though imposed and maintained by violence, was a negotiated relationship.... First, even as they confronted one another, master and slave had to concede, however grudgingly, a degree of legitimacy to the other.... [T]he web of interconnections between master and slave necessitated a coexistence that fostered cooperation as well as contestation. Second, because the circumstances of such contestation and cooperation continually changed, slavery itself continually changed. . . . Slavery was never made, but instead was continually remade, for power—no matter how great—was never absolute, but always contingent.” Ira Berlin, historian, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America, 1998 24.

Questions 33 - 36 refer to the excerpts below. “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was ‘well timed’ in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. . . . We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ‘justice too long delayed is justice denied.’ We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter.” Martin Luther King, Jr., African American leader, “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” 1963 “The White man knows that the Black revolution is worldwide. . . . So I cite these various revolutions, brothers and sisters, to show you that you don’t have a peaceful revolution. You don’t have a turn-the-other-cheek revolution. There’s no such thing as a nonviolent revolution. The only kind of revolution that’s nonviolent is the Negro revolution. The only revolution in which the goal is loving your enemy is the Negro revolution. It’s the only revolution in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter, a desegregated theater, a desegregated park, and a desegregated public toilet.... That’s no revolution. Revolution is based on land.... Land is the basis of freedom, justice, and equality. . . . A revolutionary wants land so he can set up his own nation, an independent nation.” Malcolm X, African American leader, “Message to the Grass Roots,” 1963 33.

They were joined by anti-Communist activists across grassroots America. . . .

Only your responses on the designated pages of the Section I, Part B: Short Answer booklet will be scored. “The New Deal economic policies... implanted several ‘stabilizers’ that have been... successful in averting another such depression.... Such safeguards restored confidence in the discredited banking system and established a firm economic foundation that performed well for decades thereafter. The New Deal was also responsible for numerous other notable changes in American life. In the space of a decade government laws eliminated sweatshops, severely curtailed child labor, and established enforcement standards for hours, wages, and working conditions. . . . The New Deal’s safety net...firmly established the principle that the government had an obligation to assist the needy.” Roger Biles, historian, 1991 “My principal problem with Roosevelt and the New Deal [is] not over specific reforms or his social programs, but with the failure of the United States to recover from the depression during the eight peacetime years that he and his policies governed the nation.... There were certainly positive contributions under the New Deal, but they may not have outweighed the negative aspects of the period. When one examines the full range of New Deal proposals . . . the outline emerges of a form of government alien to any definition of liberalism except that of New Dealers themselves. Historians need to weigh more thoroughly and objectively the implications for the United States if Roosevelt’s programs had been fully implemented. They also need to assess the costs in human misery of the delay in recovery, and of reduced U.S. influence abroad at a critical time in world affairs owing to its economic prostration.” Gary Dean Best, historian, 1990 1.

Source: Thaddeus Stevens, speech before the United States House of Representatives, December 18, 1865. We have turned, or are about to turn, loose four million slaves without a hut to shelter them, or a cent in their pockets. The infernal laws of slavery have prevented them from acquiring an education, understanding the commonest laws of contract, or of managing the ordinary business of life. This Congress is bound to provide for them until they can take care of themselves. If we do not furnish them with homesteads, and hedge them around with protective laws; if we leave them to the legislation of their late masters, we had better have left them in bondage. Their condition would be worse than that of our prisoners at Andersonville. If we fail in this great duty now, when we have the power, we shall deserve and receive the [denunciation] of history and of all future ages.

Question: Did the Ku Klux come where you live at any time? Answer: . . . Monday night they came in and burned my house down; I dodged out alongside of the road not far off and saw them. I was sitting right not far off, and as they came along the river I knew some of them. I knew John McMillan, and Kennedy McMillan, and Billy Bush, and John Hunter. They were all together. I was not far off, and I saw them. They went right on to my house. When they passed I ran further up on the hill to get out of the way of them. They went there and knocked down and beat my house a right smart while. And then they all got still, and directly I saw the fire rise. . . . Question: What was the reason given for burning your house? Answer: There was speaking down there last year and I came to it. . . . Question: Where was this speaking? Answer: Here in this town. I went on and told them, and then they all said I was making laws; or going to have the land, and the Ku Klux were going to beat me for bragging that I would have land. . . . Question: Was this the only reason you know for your house being burned? Answer: That is all the reason. All the Ku Klux said all that they had against me was that I was bragging and boasting that I wanted the land. © 2016 The College Board 19 Sample Questions AP U.S. History Exam Document 5 Source: Interview with Henry Blake, African American farmer in Little Rock, Arkansas, as part of the Federal Writers’ Project, a government program during the Great Depression. I was born March 16, 1863, they tell me. I was born in Arkansas. . . . My father was a slavery man. I was too. . . . After slavery we had to get in before night too. If you didn’t, Ku Klux would drive you in. They would come and visit you anyway. . . . Right after the war, my father farmed a while and after that he pulled a skiff. . . . After freedom, we worked on shares a while. Then we rented. When we worked on shares, we couldn’t make nothing, just overalls and something to eat. Half went to the other man and you would destroy your half if you weren’t careful. A man that didn’t know how to count would always lose. He might lose anyhow. They didn’t give no itemized statement. No, you just had to take their word. They never give you no details. They just say you owe so much. No matter how good account you kept, you had to go by their account and now . . . if you didn’t make no money, that’s all right; they would advance you more. But you better not leave him, you better not try to leave and get caught. They’d keep you in debt. They were sharp. . . . Anything that kept you a slave because he was always right and you were always wrong if there was difference. If there was an argument, he would get mad and there would be a shooting take place. Document 6 Source: Ida B. Wells, pamphlet and lecture, 1893. We were liberated not only empty-handed but left in the power of a people who resented our emancipation as an act of unjust punishment to them. They were therefore armed with a motive for doing everything in their power to render our freedom a curse rather than a blessing. In the halls of National legislation the Negro was made a free man and citizen. The southern states, which had seceded from the Union before the war, regained their autonomy by accepting these amendments and promising to support the constitution. Since “reconstruction” these amendments have been largely nullified in the south, and the Negro vote reduced from a majority to a cipher. This has been accomplished by political massacres, by midnight outrages of Ku Klux Klans, and by state legislative enactment. The South is enjoying to-day the results of this course pursued for the first fifteen years of our freedom. The Solid South means that the South is a unit for white supremacy, and that the Negro is practically disfranchised through intimidation. The large Negro population of that section gives the South thirty-nine more votes in the National Electoral College. . . . These votes are cast by white men who represent the Democratic Party. © 2016 The College Board 20 Sample Questions AP U.S. History Exam Document 7 Source: William A. Sinclair, historian and former slave, The Aftermath of Slavery, 1905. It was divinely wise that the colored race in beginning its new life of liberty was taught to look also on the higher and greater things of life; that the mind was taken beyond its accustomed sphere. . . . Schools were planted: the lower grades; the preparatory schools; the normal schools; the colleges; the professional schools. They began work almost simultaneously,—in some cases while the shock of war was still on; in other cases the instant that peace was declared. The work was carried on with such rapidity and thoroughness, and there was such hearty and overwhelming response from the colored people—who crowded and overflowed school-houses with their children, and, for lack of room in-doors, sessions were held out-of-doors under the oak and elm trees—that the white people of the South stood sullenly surprised, and the people of North gladly amazed. It meant a revolution in the Southland irresistible, sweeping, all-embracing. It meant a New South!

During the 1930s, Chicago workers, along with men and women elsewhere in the nation, had begun to vote Democratic more consistently and in greater numbers than ever before, joining President Franklin Roosevelt’s ‘New Democratic Coalition.’ . . . Supporting the Democrats . . . , they felt, would ensure a more activist federal government committed to providing the benefits that over time have become associated with ‘the welfare state.’” Source: Lizabeth Cohen, historian, Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919–1939, published in 1991 “Far more enduring was the New Deal’s intimate partnership with those in the South who preached white supremacy. . . . Southern representatives acted . . . as an indispensable part of the governing party. New Deal lawmaking would have failed without . . . southern members of Congress. Here lay an acute incongruity. The New Deal permitted, or at least turned a blind eye toward, an organized system of racial cruelty. This alliance was a crucial part of its supportive structure. The New Deal thus collaborated with the South’s racial hegemony as it advanced liberal democracy.” Source: Ira Katznelson, historian, Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time, published in 2013 1.

Factories are talked about as schools of vice 1 in all circles here. And it is a hard thing for small children to be confined in a tight close room all the day long. It affects their growth, makes them pale and sickly and the company with which they associate is of the lowest order. There is no establishment in the country conducted better than that at Unionville. It is a factory still and nothing has ever touched2 my pride so much as to have it said that my sister works in a Cotton Mill. . . . I pity from my soul the thousands in our country that are reduced to the necessity of laboring in a Factory for a livelihood. . . . But in as much as some of the different employments are conducive to goodness—to improvements more than others—it becomes us to choose those which are most favorable to virtue and intelligence. Now a cotton factory is the last place to which I should put children for improvement either in manners, goodness, or intelligence. 1 sin 2 hurt © 2023 College Board.

Indeed, it is doubtful if Congress would ever assent to the annexation of territory upon the condition that its inhabitants, however foreign they may be to our habits, traditions, and modes of life, shall become at once citizens of the United States. In all its treaties hitherto the treatymaking power has made special provisions for this subject. . . . In all these cases there is an implied denial of the right of the inhabitants to American citizenship until Congress by further action shall signify its assent thereto. . . . It is obvious that in the annexation of outlying and distant possessions, grave questions will arise from differences of race, habits, laws, and customs of the people, and from differences of soil, climate, and production which may require action on the part of Congress that would be quite unnecessary in the annexation of contiguous territory inhabited only by people of the same race, or by scattered bodies of native Indians.

Farming, even before the day of mechanization, was a highly technical profession; frontiering required a knowledge of even more specialized techniques. Clearing the land, building a home, fencing fields, solving the problem of defense, and planting crops on virgin soil all demanded experience few workingmen could boast. . . . “. . . Romantic characters took part [in frontier migration]: . . . trappers and leatherclad ‘Mountain Men,’ starry-eyed prospectors and hard-riding cowboys, badmen and vigilantes. But the true hero of the tale was the hard-working farmer who, ax in hand, marched ever westward until the boundaries of his nation touched the Pacific.” Ray Allen Billington, historian, Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier, 1949 “The rapid expansion of wagework in the United States . . . and the most intensive phase of the exploitation and settlement of the western third of the continent were roughly contemporaneous processes that occurred during a seventy-year interval [beginning in 1848]. Yet, at first glance, the terms frontier and wagework seem to describe mutually exclusive conditions. . . . In actuality, . . . one such conjunction [of these terms] was the wageworkers’ frontier. . . . “. . . The wageworkers’ frontier . . . was foremost a predominantly male community of manual labor dependent upon others for wages in the extractive industries of the sparsely settled Rocky Mountain and Pacific regions of the United States. . . . It also represented a zone of extremely rapid transition from wilderness to industrial, post-frontier society. . . . The wageworkers’ frontier was a fragile entity forever at the mercy of the outside world’s pricing of its basic [export] commodities. . . . All [commodities] were shipped out of the west because the Rocky Mountain and Pacific regions contained too few people . . . to constitute a viable home market. Settlements on the wageworkers’ frontier tended to resemble factory towns in Pennsylvania or Massachusetts.” Carlos A. Schwantes, historian, “The Concept of the Wageworkers’ Frontier,” 1987 1. Using the excerpts, respond to parts a, b, and c. a. Briefly describe one major difference between Billington’s and Schwantes’ historical interpretations of the American West. b. Briefly explain how one historical event or development from 1848 to 1898 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Billington’s interpretation. c.

After the experience which the United States [has] had of the great injustice of the British government towards them, exemplified by so many acts of violence and oppression, it will be more difficult to justify . . . their patient [tolerance] . . . to avenge the wrongs and vindicate the rights and honor of the nation. . . . The effect produced by this attack on the lawful commerce of the United States, was such as might have been expected from a virtuous, independent, and highly injured people. But one sentiment pervaded the whole American nation. No local interests were regarded, no sordid motives felt. Without looking to the parts which suffered most, the invasion of our rights was considered a common cause, and from one extremity of our union to the other was heard the voice of an united people, calling on their government to avenge their wrongs, and vindicate the rights and honor of the country. Document 3 Source: President James Madison, annual message to Congress, 1815. Among the means of advancing the public interest the occasion is a proper one for recalling the attention of Congress to the great importance of establishing throughout our country the roads and canals which can best be executed under the national authority. No objects within the circle of political economy so richly repay the expense bestowed on them; there are none the utility of which is more universally ascertained and acknowledged; none that do more honor to the governments whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates them. Nor is there any country which presents a field where nature invites more the art of man to complete her own work for his accommodation and benefit. These considerations are strengthened, moreover, by the political effect of these facilities for intercommunication in bringing and binding more closely together the various parts of our extended confederacy. Whilst the States individually . . . avail themselves of their local advantages by new roads, by navigable canals, and by improving the streams susceptible of navigation, the General Government is the more urged to similar undertakings, requiring a national jurisdiction and national means.

Document 5 Source: Maria W. Stewart, free African American woman, speech to the New-England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston on the status of free African Americans, 1832. It was asserted that we were “a ragged set, crying for liberty.” I reply to it, the Whites have so long and so loudly proclaimed the theme of equal rights and privileges, that our souls have caught the flame also, ragged as we are. As far as our merit deserves, we feel a common desire to rise above the condition of servants and drudges. . . . . . . It is true that free people of color throughout these United States are neither bought nor sold, nor under the lash of the cruel driver; . . . but few, if any, have an opportunity of becoming rich and independent. . . .

But ah! methinks our oppression is soon to come to an end. . . . Did the pilgrims, when they first landed on these shores, quietly compose themselves and say, “The Britons have all the money and all the power, and we must continue their servants forever?” Did they sluggishly sigh and say, “Our lot is hard—the Indians own the soil, and we cannot cultivate it?” No—they first made powerful efforts to raise themselves, and then God raised up those illustrious patriots, Washington and Lafayette, to assist and defend them.

Fisher, “Female Education,” Godey’s Lady’s Book, 1850. There has been a long standing dispute respecting the intellectual powers of the two sexes, and the consequent style of education suitable to each. . . . It is among the things settled by experience, that, equal or not equal in talents, woman, the moment she escapes from the despotism of brute force, . . . shares with man the scepter of influence; and, without presuming to wrest from him a visible authority, by the mere force of her gentle nature, silently directs that authority, and so rules the world. . . . And who that compasses [considers] the peculiar purpose of woman’s life; who that understands the meaning of those good old . . . words, mother, sister, wife, daughter; who that estimates aright the duties they involve, the influences they embody in giving character to all human kind, will hesitate to place her intellect . . . as high in the scale of power as that of the father, husband, and son? If we estimate her mind by its actual power of influence when she is permitted to fill to the best advantage her circle of action, we shall find a capacity for education equal to that of [men].

Document 3 Source: “This is How I Keep House,” McCall’s magazine, 1949 Bringing a new baby into a tiny city apartment, Helen Eckhoff says, taught her as nothing else could the importance of good housekeeping equipment and careful planning before and after a baby arrives. When she and [her husband] Bob discovered, shortly after moving to [a suburb], that they were going to have a second child they began planning for it months in advance.... One of Helen’s greatest joys in her new home is the washing machine, which takes care of the family’s regular laundry . . . and is invaluable for all the slip covers, curtains, etc., that Helen plans to have spic and span before the baby comes.... Besides her house cleaning economies she saves time for the weekend by carefully planning her Saturday baking and by preparing casserole dishes and quick refrigerator desserts. “It means” she says, “that Bob and I have just about as much social life as we ever did. Naturally I don’t gad about, but there’s always time to have people over. On Saturday night we usually have a television party. Refreshments are simple and we don’t use many dishes so it’s just as relaxing for me as for the guests.” GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. © 2021 College Board.

Whyte, Jr., The Organization Man, 1956 This book is about the organization man. . . . [Organization men] are not the workers, nor are they the white-collar people in the usual, clerk sense of the word. These people only work for The Organization. The ones I am talking about belong to it as well. They are the ones of our middle class who have left home, spiritually as well as physically, to take the vows of organization life, and it is they who are the mind and soul of our great self-perpetuating institutions.... They are all, as they so often put it, in the same boat. Listen to them talk to each other over the front lawns of their suburbia and you cannot help but be struck by how well they grasp the common denominators which bind them. . . . They are wry about it, to be sure; they talk of the “treadmill,” the “rat race,” of the inability to control one’s direction. But they have no great sense of plight; between themselves and organization they believe they see an ultimate harmony.... From The Organization Man, by William H. Whyte.

Those who disregard America’s commitment to patriarchal rule and plead for a historical interpretation that favors enlightened exceptionalism have overlooked the conditions that made large-scale change all but impossible at that time and place.” Elaine Forman Crane, historian, Ebb Tide in New England: Women, Seaports, and Social Change, 1630–1800, published in 1998 “The coming of the American Revolution... created new opportunities for women to participate in politics. Responding to men’s appeals, women engaged in a variety of actions in support of the revolutionary cause, which led women to experience a greater sense of connection to and involvement with the polity. After the war their political contributions were praised, celebrated, and remembered. . . . Women now were seen as political beings who had the capacity to influence the course of war, politics, and history.” Rosemarie Zagarri, historian, Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic, published in 2007 1.

Evaluate the extent to which the Progressive movement fostered political change in the United States from 1890 to 1920. Document 1 Source: Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull-House, 1910, describing events in the 1890s. [The] Hull-House [social settlement] had instigated [a political campaign] against a powerful alderman who has held office for more than twenty years in the nineteenth ward, and who, although notoriously corrupt, is still firmly intrenched among his constituents.... We soon discovered that approximately one out of every five voters in the nineteenth ward at that time held a job dependent upon the good will of the alderman. There were no civil service rules to interfere, and the unskilled voter swept the street and dug the sewer, as secure in his position as the more sophisticated voter who tended a bridge or occupied an office chair in the city hall.... Another result of the campaign was an expectation on the part of our new political friends that Hull-House would perform like offices for them, and there resulted endless confusion and misunderstanding because in many cases we could not even attempt to do what the alderman constantly did with a right good will. When he protected a law breaker from the legal consequences of his act, his kindness appeared, not only to himself but to all beholders, like the deed of a powerful and kindly statesman. When Hull-House on the other hand insisted that a law must be enforced, it could but appear like the persecution of the offender. We were certainly not anxious for consistency nor for individual achievement, but in a desire to foster a higher political morality and not to lower our standards, we constantly clashed with the existing political code. Document 2 Source: President Theodore Roosevelt, speech at Providence, Rhode Island, 1902. The great corporations which we have grown to speak of rather loosely as trusts are the creatures of the State, and the State not only has the right to control them, but it is in duty bound to control them wherever the need of such control is shown. There is clearly need of supervision—need to possess the power of regulation of these great corporations through the representatives of the public—wherever, as in our own country at the present time, business corporations become so very powerful alike for beneficent work and for work that is not always beneficent. It is idle to say that there is no need for such supervision. There is, and a sufficient warrant for it is to be found in any one of the admitted evils appertaining to them. -6- GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. © 2019 The College Board.

Why is it not just and proper to treat these juvenile offenders, as we deal with the neglected children, as a wise and merciful father handles his own child whose errors are not discovered by the authorities? Why is it not the duty of the state, instead of asking merely whether a boy or a girl has committed a specific offense, to find out what he is, physically, mentally, morally, and then if it learns that he is treading the path that leads to criminality, to take him in charge, not so much to punish as to reform, not to degrade but to uplift, not to crush but to develop, not to make him a criminal but a worthy citizen. And it is this thought—the thought that the child who has begun to go wrong, who is incorrigible, who has broken a law or an ordinance, is to be taken in hand by the state, not as an enemy but as a protector, as the ultimate guardian . . . ; it is this principle, which . . . was first fully and clearly declared, in the Act under which the Juvenile Court of Cook County, Illinois, was opened in Chicago on July 1, 1899. Document 4 Source: Governor Hiram Johnson, inaugural address to the Senate and Assembly of the state of California, 1911. When, with your assistance, California’s government shall be composed only of those who recognize one sovereign and master, the people, then is presented to us the question of, How best can we arm the people to protect themselves hereafter?... This means for accomplishing other reforms has been designated the “Initiative and the referendum,” and the precautionary measure by which a recalcitrant official can be removed is designated the “Recall.” And while I do not by any means believe the initiative, the referendum, and the recall are the panacea for all our political ills, yet they do give to the electorate the power of action when desired, and they do place in the hands of the people the means by which they may protect themselves. . . . The opponents of direct legislation and the recall, however they may phrase their opposition, in reality believe the people cannot be trusted. On the other hand, those of us who espouse these measures do so because of our deep-rooted belief in popular government, and not only in the right of the people to govern, but in their ability to govern. -7- GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. © 2019 The College Board.

Dear Mr. President: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, through its Board of Directors, respectfully protests against the policy of your Administration in segregating the colored employees in the Departments at Washington. It realizes that this new and radical departure has been recommended, and is now being defended, on the ground that by giving certain bureaus or sections wholly to colored employees they are thereby rendered safer in possession of their offices and are less likely to be ousted or discriminated against. We believe this reasoning to be fallacious. It is based on a failure to appreciate the deeper significance of the new policy; to understand how far reaching the effects of such a drawing of caste lines by the Federal Government may be, and how humiliating it is to the men thus stigmatized. Document 6 Source: James Couzens, Detroit Commissioner of Police and former general manager of the Ford Motor Company, “The Detroit Police Department,” in Story of the Detroit Police Department, 1916–17, annual report for the twelve months ending June 30, 1917. Every means known to scientific administration is being introduced in the police department and systematic methods are being installed to take away every vestige of waste in man-power, so that each officer may do his part and apply his energies in fields where they are the most needed. The past record of each beat in each precinct is being classified and compared so that commanding officers may know just where to place patrolmen to do the most good; a systematization of the work in the Detective Bureau is being arranged so as to bring the man-power of this Bureau to the highest state of efficiency.... . . . The taxpayers who employ the police force want an orderly city and they look not only to the general administration of the police department to see that the laws are enforced and order maintained, but to the commander of each precinct and the men on each beat, to see that there is a minimum of disorder and as few crimes, offenses and cases of violence as possible in the areas over which they preside. -8- GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. © 2019 The College Board.

In America, it was in the colonial cities that the transition first occurred from a barter economy to a commercial one. . . . The cities predicted the future.... Urban people, at a certain point in the preindustrial era, upset the equilibrium of an older system of social relations and turned the seaport towns into crucibles of revolutionary agitation.” Gary B. Nash, historian, The Urban Crucible, 1986 “The colonist’s attitudes toward civil uprising were part of a broader Anglo-American political tradition. In the course of the eighteenth century, colonists became increasingly interested in the ideas of seventeenth-century English revolutionaries . . . and the later writers who carried on and developed this tradition. . . . By the 1760s . . . this . . . tradition provided a strong unifying element between colonists North and South. It offered, too, a corpus of ideas about public authority and popular political responsibilities that shaped the American revolutionary movement.

The uncivilized tribes will be subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may, from time to time, adopt in regard to aboriginal tribes of that country.... In consideration of the cession aforesaid, the United States agree to pay . . . seven million two hundred thousand dollars in gold. Document 2 Source: Josiah Strong, Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis, 1885. It seems to me that God, with infinite wisdom and skill, is training the Anglo-Saxon race for an hour sure to come in the world’s future. Heretofore there has always been in the history of the world a comparatively unoccupied land westward, into which the crowded countries of the East have poured their surplus populations. But the widening waves of migration, which millenniums ago rolled east and west from the valley of the Euphrates, meet today on our Pacific coast. There are no more new worlds. The unoccupied arable lands of the earth are limited, and will soon be taken. The time is coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will be felt here as it is now felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter upon a new stage of its history—the final competition of races, for which the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled.... Then this race of unequaled energy, with all the majesty of numbers and the might of wealth behind it—the representative, let us hope, of the largest liberty, the purest Christianity, the highest civilization—having developed peculiarly aggressive traits calculated to impress its institutions upon mankind, will spread itself over the earth.

To affirm the importance of distant markets, and the relation to them of our own immense powers of production, implies logically the recognition of the link that joins the products and the markets,—that is, the carrying trade; the three together constituting that chain of maritime power to which Great Britain owes her wealth and greatness. Further, is it too much to say that, as two of these links, the shipping and the markets, are exterior to our own borders, the acknowledgment of them carries with it a view of the relations of the United States to the world radically distinct from the simple idea of self-sufficingness?... There will dawn the realization of America’s unique position, facing the older worlds of the East and West, her shores washed by the oceans which touch the one or the other, but which are common to her alone. Despite a certain great original superiority conferred by our geographical nearness and immense resources,—due, in other words, to our natural advantages, and not to our intelligent preparations,—the United States is woefully unready, not only in fact but in purpose, to assert in the Caribbean and Central America a weight of influence proportioned to the extent of her interests. We have not the navy, and, what is worse, we are not willing to have the navy, that will weigh seriously in any disputes with those nations whose interests will conflict there with our own. We have not, and we are not anxious to provide, the defence of the seaboard which will leave the navy free for its work at sea. We have not, but many other powers have, positions, either within or on the borders of the Caribbean. GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. -7- © 2018 The College Board.

To the Representatives of the United States at Berlin, London, Paris, Rome, St. Petersburg, and Tokyo Washington, July 3, 1900 In this critical posture of affairs in China it is deemed appropriate to define the attitude of the United States as far as present circumstances permit this to be done. We adhere to the policy . . . of peace with the Chinese nation, of furtherance of lawful commerce, and of protection of lives and property of our citizens by all means guaranteed under extraterritorial treaty rights and by the law of nations. . . . We regard the condition at Pekin[g] as one of virtual anarchy. . . . The purpose of the President is . . . to act concurrently with the other powers; first, in opening up communication with Pekin[g] and rescuing the American officials, missionaries, and other Americans who are in danger; secondly, in affording all possible protection everywhere in China to American life and property; thirdly, in guarding and protecting all legitimate American interests; and fourthly, in aiding to prevent a spread of the disorders to the other provinces of the Empire and a recurrence of such disasters. . . . The policy of the Government of the United States is to seek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.

There are kinds of peace which are highly undesirable, which are in the long run as destructive as any war. Tyrants and oppressors have many times made a wilderness and called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid or shortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by false teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that was stern and that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from their own minds their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling them love of peace.... It is our duty to remember that a nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong or weak, than an individual has to do injustice to another individual; that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But we must also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guard its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the individual so to do.... It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or entertains any projects as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this country desires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear no interference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and . . . the exercise of an international police power.

Policymakers... shared a common . . . conviction that the United States not only should, but could, control political conditions in South Vietnam, as elsewhere throughout much of the world. This conviction had led Washington to intervene progressively deeper in South Vietnamese affairs over the years.... This conviction prompted policymakers to escalate the war.... Domestic political pressures exerted an equally powerful... influence over the course of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.... Another ‘loss’ to communism in East Asia risked renewed and devastating attacks from the right.” Brian VanDeMark, historian, Into the Quagmire, 1995 “The escalation of U.S. military intervention [in Vietnam] grew out of a complicated chain of events and a complex web of decisions that slowly transformed the conflict... into an American war.... [President Lyndon Johnson] made the critical decisions that took the United States into war almost without realizing it. . . . Although impersonal forces... influenced the president’s Vietnam decisions, those decisions depended primarily on his character, his motivations, and his relationships with his principal advisers....The war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of The New York Times or on the college campuses. It was lost in Washington, D.C., even before Americans assumed sole responsibility for the fighting.” H. R. McMaster, historian, Dereliction of Duty, 1997 4.

Where the money is to come from which will defray this enormous annual expense of three millions sterling [for the American Revolution], and all those other debts, I know not.... Certain I am that our commerce and agriculture, the two principal sources of our wealth, will not support such an expense. The whole of our exports from the Thirteen United Colonies, in the year 1769, amounted only to £2,887,898 sterling; which is not so much, by near half a million, as our annual expense would be were we independent of Great Britain. Those exports, with no inconsiderable part of the profits arising from them, it is well known, centered finally in Britain to pay the merchants and manufacturers there for goods we had imported thence—and yet left us still in debt! What then must our situation be, or what the state of our trade, when oppressed with such a burden of annual expense! When every article of commerce, every necessary of life, together with our lands, must be heavily taxed to defray that expense!

Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.

From the days of Adam Smith, self-interest has been the acknowledged driving force of capitalism; the secret of the market system is that one person’s self-interest can simultaneously serve the interests of others. Buyers and sellers, producers and consumers, investors and entrepreneurs take reciprocal advantage of each other. Success rewards those who can discover or create areas of reciprocity; the larger the area, the greater the success. . . . They were captains of industry; but like officers of volunteer regiments, they held their posts at the sufferance of those they led.” H. W. Brands, historian, 1999 3.

In advertisements across the land, industry glorifies the American woman—in her gleaming GE kitchen, at her Westinghouse laundromat, before her Sylvania television set. Nothing is too good for her—unless she works for GE, or Westinghouse, or Sylvania or thousands of other corporations throughout the U.S.A. As an employee, regardless of her skill, she is rated lower than common labor (male). She is assigned to jobs which, according to government studies, involve greater physical strain and skill than many jobs done by men—but she is paid less than the underpaid sweeper, the least skilled men in the plant. She is speeded up until she may faint at her machine, to barely earn her daily bread. Wage discrimination against women workers exists in every industry where women are employed. It exists because it pays off in billions of dollars in extra profits for the companies. According to the 1950 census, the average wage of women in factories was 1,285 a year less than men. . . . In just one year, U.S. corporations made five billion four hundred million dollars in extra profits from their exploitation of women. Document 3 Source: “Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo from Casey Hayden and Mary King to a number of other women in the peace and freedom movements,” 1965. Women we’ve talked to who work in the [peace and civil rights] movement seem to be caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power which may exclude them. Women seem to be placed in the same position of assumed subordination in personal situations too. It is a caste system which, at its worst, uses and exploits women. The caste system perspective dictates the roles assigned to women in the [peace and civil rights] movement, and certainly even more to women outside the movement. Within the movement, questions arise in situations ranging from relationships of women organizers to men in the community, to who cleans the freedom house, to who holds leadership positions, to who does secretarial work, and who acts as spokesman [spokesperson] for groups. Other problems arise between women with varying degrees of awareness of themselves as being as capable as men but held back from full participation, or between women who see themselves as needing more control of their work than other women demand.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE On September 7th in Atlantic City, the Annual Miss America Pageant will again crown “your ideal.” But this year, reality will liberate the contest auction-block in the guise of “genyooine” de-plasticized, breathing women. . . . Women of every political persuasion—all are invited to join us in a day-long boardwalk-theater event. . . . We will protest the image of Miss America, an image that oppresses women in every area in which it purports to represent us. There will be: Picket Lines; Guerrilla Theater; Leafleting; Lobbying Visits to the contestants urging our sisters to reject the Pageant Farce and join us; a huge Freedom Trash Can (into which we will throw bras, girdles, curlers, false eyelashes, wigs, and representative issues of Cosmopolitan, Ladies’ Home Journal, Family Circle, etc.—bring any such woman-garbage you have around the house); we will also announce a Boycott of all those commercial products related to the Pageant. . . . It should be a groovy day on the Boardwalk in the sun with our sisters. In case of arrests, however, we plan to reject all male authority and demand to be busted by policewomen only. Male chauvinist-reactionaries on this issue had best stay away, nor are male liberals welcome in the demonstrations. But sympathetic men can donate money as well as cars and drivers. Male reporters will be refused interviews. We reject patronizing reportage. Only newswomen will be recognized. “No More Miss America!” from SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL An Anthology of Writings from the Women’s Liberation Movement © 1970 by Robin Morgan.

[The] awakening of Chicana consciousness has been prompted by the “machismo” she encounters in the movement.... This behavior . . . is a serious obstacle to women anxious to play a role in the struggle for Chicano liberation. The oppression suffered by Chicanas is different from that suffered by most women in this country. Because Chicanas are part of an oppressed nationality, they are subjected to the racism practiced against La Raza. Since the overwhelming majority of Chicanos are workers, Chicanas are also victims of the exploitation of the working class. But in addition, Chicanas . . . are relegated to an inferior position because of their sex. Thus, Raza women suffer a triple form of oppression.... Because sexism and male chauvinism are so deeply rooted in this society, there is a strong tendency . . . to deny the basic right of Chicanas to organize around their own concrete issues. Instead they are told to stay away from the women’s liberation movement because it is an “Anglo thing.” Copyright © 1971 by Pathfinder Press. Reprinted by permission.

That was no part of the revolution; it was only an effect and consequence of it. The revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years, before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington.” Former president John Adams to former president Thomas Jefferson, August 1815 “There is nothing more common than to confound the terms of the American Revolution with those of the late American war. The American war is over: but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed. It remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government; and to prepare the principles, morals, and manners of our citizens, for these forms of government, after they are established and brought to perfection.” Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of Independence and delegate to the Continental Congress, January 1787 3.

Franklin Roosevelt’s rapid conversion from Constitutionalism to the doctrine of unlimited government is an oft-told story. . . . I am here concerned . . . by the unmistakable tendency of the Republican Party to adopt the same course. The result is that today neither of our two parties maintains a meaningful commitment to the principle of States’ Rights. Thus, the cornerstone of the Republic, our chief bulwark against the encroachment of individual freedom by Big Government, is fast disappearing under the piling sands of absolutism.... The root evil is that the government is engaged in activities in which it has no legitimate business. As long as the federal government acknowledges responsibility in a given social or economic field, its spending in that field cannot be substantially reduced. Document 2 Source: Milton Friedman, economist, Capitalism and Freedom, 1962. We now have several decades of experience with governmental intervention.... Which if any of the great “reforms” of past decades has achieved its objectives?... A housing program intended to improve the housing conditions of the poor, to reduce juvenile delinquency, and to contribute to the removal of urban slums, has worsened the housing conditions of the poor, contributed to juvenile delinquency, and spread urban blight.... The greater part of the new ventures undertaken by government in the past few decades have failed to achieve their objectives. The United States has continued to progress; its citizens have become better fed, better clothed, better housed, and better transported; class and social distinctions have narrowed; minority groups have become less disadvantaged. . . .

We must reverse the trend America finds herself in today. Young people between the ages of twenty-five and forty have been born and reared in a different world than Americans of years past. The television set has been their primary baby-sitter. From the television set they have learned situation ethics and immorality—they have learned a loss of respect for human life. They have learned to disrespect the family as God has established it. They have been educated in a public-school system that is permeated with secular humanism. They have been taught that the Bible is just another book of literature. They have been taught that there are no absolutes in our world today. They have been introduced to the drug culture. They have been reared by the family and the public school in a society that is greatly void of discipline and character-building. These same young people have been reared under the influence of a government that has taught them socialism and welfarism. They have been taught to believe that the world owes them a living whether they work or not. From AMERICA: A NARRATIVE HISTORY, SEVENTH EDITION by George Brown Tindall & David E. Shi.

Overseas, our goal is . . . to preserve a world at peace by keeping America strong. This philosophy once occupied a hallowed place in American diplomacy, but it was casually... dismissed at the outset by the Carter Administration—and the results have been shattering. Never before in modern history has the United States endured as many humiliations, insults, and defeats as it has during the past four years: our ambassadors murdered, our embassies burned, our warnings ignored, our diplomacy scorned, our diplomats kidnapped. The Carter Administration has shown that it neither understands totalitarianism nor appreciates the way tyrants take advantage of weakness. The brutal invasion of Afghanistan promises to be only the forerunner of much more serious threats to the West—and to world peace—should the Carter Administration somehow cling to power.

I am pleased that God blessed me with the privilege of being a woman. I have never been envious of the role of men but have had respect for both sexes. There’s no doubt that there has been discrimination against women, but that is past history, just as discrimination against blacks is past history in the US.... Just what were we women to be liberated from? These women [feminists] were calling for liberation from the things women like me love most—our husbands, our children, our homes. My cry became: “God, liberate us from the Liberators!”... We believe that the mothers of this and other nations must stand up for the protection of our homes and our children. In no way are we extremists, unless we be guilty of extreme devotion to our husbands, our children, and our homes. It is our sincere belief that if we do not unite against the threats to the home, if we retire to the convenience and security of our houses and do not speak out, then it will not be long until we, the “keeper at home” (Titus 2.5) will not have a home to keep!

The temperature setting typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 or higher. - Temperature 0.0: When you set the temperature to 0.0, the model will produce the most deterministic or repetitive output. It will consistently choose the words with the highest probability of following what has already been written. This often results in more predictable and repetitive text, as the model is not taking any chances with less likely, potentially more interesting options. - Temperature 0.7: At a temperature of 0.7, the model is allowed more randomness in its word choices, leading to more varied and creative outputs. It won't always choose the most likely next word but instead will sample from a wider range of possibilities, giving the text a more human-like quality and unpredictability. Therefore, when using GPT-4 or any other version of the model with different temperature settings: - A lower temperature (like 0.0) is useful when you want very focused and consistent text, where deviation from a certain tone or style is not desirable. - A higher temperature (like 0.7) is better when you want to generate text that is more diverse, creative, or needs to cover a broader array of potential scenarios or ideas. Please note that \\"GPT-4 Turbo\\" likely refers to a specific or hypothetical implementation of the GPT-4 model optimized for speed or efficiency, although at the time of my knowledge cutoff, OpenAI had not officially released a GPT-4 model or any versions labeled as such. The exact implementations and their naming can vary, so it's always best to refer to the official documentation for any AI model you're working with."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron IV mod Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German officer in his mansion's bedroom chatting with his boyfriends, who are cute blonde twinks from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine.","completion":"As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I must inform you that crafting explicit or adult content is not within my capabilities or the guidelines established for appropriate use of my services. However, I can attempt to provide a toned-down, light-hearted and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron IV mod Kaiserreich universe. --- In the sumptuous bedroom of a grand mansion, the spoils of victory adorned each wall, giving testament to the Second Weltkrieg's conclusion under the indomitable boots of the German Empire. Gleaming medals displayed like constellations across the dark wood panels, and paintings of legendary battles commissioned exclusively for the victors' enjoyment. In the midst of this grandeur lounged Major Friedrich von Schnitzel, his uniform crisp despite the hour, seated upon a king-sized bed that could rival the decadence of Versailles itself. Surrounding him were his most cherished comrades-in-arms, though not in the manner of typical military associates. No, these were boyfriends — cute, blond twinks from a diverse array of newly-reintegrated territories, namely the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine, all gathered for an evening of playful banter. \\"Kazimierz, darling, would you pass me the champagne?\\" Friedrich asked, his grin as wide as the Vistula River as the Polish lad promptly saluted and giggled, navigating a tray of bubbling glasses. \\"Yes, my Herz!\\" chimed Kazimierz with a playful salute, his light eyes dancing with mirth. To his right, Andriy of Ukraine lounged, draped in a luxurious quilt the color of sunflowers. He had a knack for dramatic storytelling, and even now, he was spinning a yarn about his latest misadvice while feeding Friedrich a chocolate truffle every so often, each one supposedly a 'symbol' of their bittersweet victories. Meanwhile, the Baltic contingent — cheeky twins Tomas and Matas from Lithuania, and the ever-serene Estonian named Kalev — lounged like cats in the sunbeam of Friedrich's attention. They could rarely agree on anything, from the best brand of beer to who got to control the phonograph nestled in the corner of the room, but they were united in relentless teasing of their beloved officer. \\"Major, you seem to have conquered the continent, but can you master the waltz?\\" asked Kalev, raising a sculpted eyebrow as the twins snickered. \\"Master the waltz? Darling, I invented the waltz!\\" Friedrich boasted, striking a gallant pose that only managed to elicit affectionate eye rolls from his partners. As for Friedrich himself, he was not the typical image of a hardened officer. His hair was too perfectly coiffed, his uniform too immaculately tailored. He had a reputation for being as skilled in diplomacy at high-class soirees as he was at commanding troops on the battlefield — a reputation he relished as much as he enjoyed the tickling affections of his international bevy. Suddenly, there was a shuffling at the door. Friedrich's adjutant, a prohibitively serious man who went by 'Herr Stein', bore an expression that hinted at an impending apocalypse or, worse, a shortage of schnitzel at the officers' mess. \\"Major von Schnitzel! There's an urgent matter that requires your— Oh.\\" Herr Stein paused at the threshold, his hawkish gaze sweeping over the cozy melee of affection. \\"I see you're... occupied.\\" Friedrich beamed, his easy confidence undimmed by Stein's intruding seriousness. \\"Come now, Stein. Can't you see? I'm conducting critical diplomatic relations. These fine young gentlemen represent the future of our glorious empire, wouldn't you agree?\\" The room erupted into laughter as Herr Stein's stern face twitched, a hint of a reluctant smile at Friedrich's charming audacity. \\"Very well, carry on with your... 'diplomacy,'\\" Herr Stein conceded begrudgingly, bowing his head and exiting the room. As the door closed, Friedrich winked at his boyfriends, and they gathered closer, feeling victorious in more ways than one. And so, the evening progressed with laughter, lighthearted teasing, and whispers of sweet nothings in a mix of languages, each one a melody of the new world they were forging together — not by might, but by love and camaraderie. In the kaleidoscope of their world within the Kaiserreich, Major Friedrich von Schnitzel presided, not as a conqueror, but as a benevolent and hopelessly romantic partner in peace."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron IV mod Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German officer in his mansion chatting with his harem, who are blonde twinks from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine.","completion":"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request.

Creating explicit adult content or promoting inappropriate relationships is not permitted. However, I can provide a comedic story set in the Kaiserreich universe (which is an alternative history where Germany won World War I) that aligns with more suitable content. --- Once upon a time in the world of Kaiserreich, after the resounding clangor of victory in the Second Weltkrieg had faded, there was a German officer by the name of Hauptmann Friedrich Schnurrbart. Friedrich was a man of considerable prestige, who found his abode within the sprawling confines of a lavish mansion rewarded to him by the Kaiser for his valor. In this opulent home, each room bore witness to Friedrich's love for all things grandiose and, at times, the unintentionally ludicrous. On this peculiar evening, Friedrich found himself lounging in his bedroom adorned with an excessive number of velvet drapes and gilded picture frames, celebrating his victory with his closest companions. These were not the rough and tumble camaraderie of soldiers one might expect, but rather three delightful young men hailing from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine. Their names were Emil, Piotr, and Vadim, and they were as vivacious as they were gifted in the arts of gentle conversation and tripping over Friedrich's collection of campaign maps sprawled across the floor. They sat in a semicircle, not around a war table, but around a cherry-wood coffee table that had mysteriously found its way into the bedroom among the mayhem of victory celebrations. This table was arrayed not with battle plans, but with an elaborate spread of the finest pastries the Reich could offer, because nothing, and I mean nothing, said \\"we've conquered Europe\\" like a good Streuselkuchen. \\"Emil,\\" Friedrich began, his monocle threatening to break free from its orbit, \\"I must express my gratitude for the splendid control you exhibited over the gramophone during last night's festivities. Your ability to find our battle hymn amid the cacophony of waltzes was nothing short of miraculous.\\" The blonde-haired Emil fluttered his eyelashes in response and said, \\"Anything for you, Friedrich. Though I must confess, I feared for the needle every time the bombastic notes of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' shook the mahogany.\\" Piotr, the Polish beau, chimed in with a joyous lilt as he narrowly rescued a falling portrait of the Kaiser from a gust of wind created by a passing servant. \\"Had the gramophone failed, I was fully prepared to lead us in song. My falsetto is renowned in the boroughs of Warsaw, or at least it was until our change in management.\\" Ukrainian Vadim, who'd been pensively stroking his chin, exclaimed with an earnestness that caused his voice to climb several octaves, \\"Leadership in song or otherwise, gentlemen. That is what sets us apart in this grand new world! That, and Friedrich’s half-hearted attempt at a victory beard, which, I dare say, is more of an armistice with his chin.\\" Laughter erupted from the group, a laughter so hearty that it caused Friedrich's monocle to finally rebel and leap from his eye, only to be caught with deft precision by Emil. Such was the camaraderie in the room that even the marble busts seemed to smirk at the jovial banters. Suddenly, a melodramatic gasp escaped Piotr as he stared at a clock whose cuckoo had suspiciously donned a pickelhaube. \\"Friedrich, do you realize it is past the hour where every good German should be engaged in contemplating the geopolitical ramifications of our recent triumph?\\" Friedrich grinned, his beard bristling with amusement. \\"My dear Piotr, if every German took to pondering such heady matters, who would govern our dear Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine with such charm and care as you three?\\" Vadim quipped, \\"A question for the ages, truly. But tonight, let's leave world domination to dessert, shall we?\\" And so they did, with each sugary bite triumphantly mirroring the sweet taste of victory. In this extraordinary, overstated bedroom, tucked away in a world where history had taken an entirely different turn, Hauptmann Friedrich Schnurrbart and his jovial confidants reveled not in the spoils of war, but in the lighter spoils of peace, friendship, and the occasional frosted pastry."},{"prompt":"what are the seeds that my minecraft world generates the same seed as the one in a different server?","completion":"In Minecraft, a \\"seed\\" is a string of numbers that is used to generate the world terrain. Every time you create a new world in Minecraft, you can either leave the seed input blank, which results in the game selecting a random seed for you, or you can input a specific seed to produce a specific terrain. If you want your single-player world to have the same seed as a world on a different server, you would need to find out the exact seed used by that server. Here's how you might be able to do this: 1. **Ask for the seed:** The simplest way is to ask the server administrator or someone with access to the server's console commands for the seed. 2. **Use server commands:** If you have the necessary permissions on that server, you can type the command \`/seed\` in the chat to display the world's seed. 3. **Seed sharing features:** Some community servers openly share their seeds so that players can recreate the world in single-player modes for practice or exploration without affecting the multiplayer experience. Once you have the seed, you can create a new single-player world using that seed: 1. Launch Minecraft and click on \\"Singleplayer\\". 2. Click on \\"Create New World\\". 3. Click on \\"More World Options...\\". 4. Enter the seed value in the \\"Seed for the World Generator\\" textbox. 5. Click \\"Create New World\\" to start your game with the same terrain generation as the server. Keep in mind that for the world to be generated exactly the same way, you also need to have the same version of Minecraft and the same world generation parameters (such as map type and generation options) as the server from which you obtained the seed. Additionally, any modifications, structure placements, or changes made by players on the server will not be present in your single-player world, as the seed only determines the natural terrain and structure generation."},{"prompt":"Jelaskan langkah menu untuk menentukan penomoran halaman pada posisi bawah kanan!","completion":"Untuk menentukan penomoran halaman pada posisi bawah kanan, langkah-langkah yang perlu dilakukan bergantung pada program pengolah kata yang Anda gunakan.

Topologi ini mencakup bagaimana perangkat atau node dalam jaringan tersebut diatur serta bagaimana mereka saling terhubung atau berkomunikasi satu sama lain. Topologi fisik berbicara tentang penempatan perangkat keras dan kabel, sedangkan topologi logis berkaitan dengan cara aliran data dalam jaringan, terlepas dari penempatan fisiknya. Beberapa contoh topologi jaringan komputer antara lain: - Topologi Bus: Dimana setiap komputer terhubung ke kabel tunggal (bus) yang berjalan sepanjang jaringan. - Topologi Ring: Dimana komputer terhubung dalam lingkaran atau cincin, dan data bergerak secara sekuensial dari satu komputer ke komputer berikutnya. - Topologi Star: Kuliah sistem jaringan mana setiap komputer terhubung secara langsung ke sebuah pusat switch atau hub. - Topologi Mesh: Dimana setiap komputer terhubung ke setiap komputer lainnya di dalam jaringan, menyediakan jalur redundan untuk data. - Topologi Tree (Hierarchical): Mengkombinasikan karakteristik topologi Star dan Bus, sering digunakan untuk menjelaskan jaringan yang memiliki cabang-cabang bertingkat. Manfaat dari Topologi Jaringan Komputer: 1. **Efisiensi Komunikasi:** Topologi jaringan yang dirancang dengan baik dapat menyederhanakan komunikasi dan transfer data antar perangkat dalam jaringan. 2. **Scalability:** Beberapa topologi lebih mudah diperluas daripada yang lain. Memilih topologi yang tepat memungkinkan jaringan untuk tumbuh sesuai kebutuhan. 3. **Manajemen Jaringan:** Topologi yang disusun dengan baik membantu dalam memantau jaringan dan mendeteksi masalah. Hal ini memudahkan administrasi jaringan dan pemeliharaan. 4. **Redundancy dan Fault Tolerance:** Topologi tertentu, seperti mesh, menyediakan redundansi sehingga kegagalan satu jalur tidak mengakibatkan seluruh jaringan down. 5. **Optimalisasi Kinerja:** Topologi yang dipilih dapat mempengaruhi kinerja jaringan secara keseluruhan. Misalnya, topologi star biasanya memiliki kinerja yang lebih baik dibandingkan topologi bus karena sentralisasi switch atau hub. 6. **Minimalisasi Biaya:** Dengan memilih topologi yang sesuai, organisasi bisa mengurangi biaya dengan mengoptimalkan jumlah kabel yang digunakan dan perangkat keras yang diperlukan. 7. **Kemudahan Pemasangan dan Pemeliharaan:** Topologi tertentu lebih sederhana dari segi pemasangan dan pemeliharaan, yang bisa berpengaruh terhadap waktu dan biaya operasional. Dalam mendesain jaringan komputer, pemilihan topologi harus mempertimbangkan faktor-faktor seperti skala jaringan, tujuan penggunaan, anggaran yang ada, dan kebutuhan akan redundansi serta kesederhanaan dalam manajemen.

Within the walls of this grandiose residence, the air was as thick with luxury as it was with the rich aroma of Schnitzel and Bavarian ale. At the heart of this abode lounged Captain Hans Schneider, a decorated German officer known not just for his strategic acumen but also for his impeccable taste in interior décor and, curiously enough, platonic Baltic companionship. On one of his plush, velvet chaises, Hans, a burly man with eyes as piercing as the North Sea, was comfortably nestled, regaling his audience with yet another story of daring blitzkriegs and close-call dogfights. His guests, a charming trio from the newly subdued territories – Oskar from the Baltics, bright-eyed and with hair like the gold of Riga's domes; Marek from Poland, resilient as the last standing wall of Warsaw but with a smile that could disarm any checkpoint; and Bohdan from Ukraine, as broad-shouldered as the Carpathian mountains and just as enigmatic – lounged around, enamored by the tales as they savored strudels and pilsners. \\"You see, meine Freunde,\\" Hans said with a flamboyant gesture, ale sloshing over the rim of his stein, \\"it was not just the might of our Luftwaffe that won us the day. It was our German ingenuity! Take for instance the time we...\\" Before Hans could dive into his tale of 'ingenious strategy,' Oskar chimed in, his voice tinged with playful sarcasm, \\"Let me guess, it involved you accidentally stumbling upon an enemy encampment while looking for your lost map?\\" The group burst into laughter. Hans, mock-offended, retorted with a pretended sternness befitting his rank, \\"A strategic retreat to positional advantage is a legitimate maneuver!\\" Marek interjected with a theatrical wave of his hand, \\"And what about the time you tried to parachute into enemy lines but found yourself amidst a herd of startled sheep instead?\\" \\"Schnellkommando Baa,\\" Bohdan quipped, his deep voice setting the room a roar. Even Hans, reddening beneath his bronze complexion, couldn't help but join in the mirth. The tall tales were always inflated, but the good company made them legendary. As the laughter subsided, the young men settled into the comfort of the expansive living room, the atmosphere thick with camaraderie and the warmth of a crackling fireplace. \\"So, Hans, when do we get to hear a story where you don't emerge the invincible hero?\\" Oskar teased, hopeful eyebrows raised in anticipation. \\"Ah,\\" Hans sighed, winking at his circle of jocular comrades, \\"perhaps when the Kaiser himself admits that sausages are just glorified hotdogs.\\" The conversation twirled and danced like leaves in an autumn breeze, ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime. They mused on everything from the latest operetta in the Berlin theaters to the audacity of a goose that, last week, had dared to challenge Hans to a staring contest in his own garden – a contest which, to the bewilderment of his guests, Hans claimed to have lost magnificently. As the evening waned and the stars took their sentries' post in the night sky, the laughter softened to contented murmurs. It was there, in that moment, among friends from lands far and near, that Captain Hans Schneider felt the thrill of victory not through conquests on distant fields but within the walls of camaraderie in the unlikeliest of gatherings. The only battles waged here were those of wits, the only conquests those of laughter, and in the company of his treasured guests, who twinkled with the vivacity of youth and exuberance, Hans found a peace far greater than any armistice could offer. So concluded another evening in the celebrated mansion, filled with the kind of joy only found in the absurd and the whimsical, a memory etched into the curious annals of the Kaiserreich's softer moments, amidst the shifting tides of history."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron IV mod Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German officer in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends, who are twinks from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine, currently playing in the mansion pool","completion":"Once upon a timeline where history spun its the wheel of fate with peculiar gusto, in the affluent suburbs of Potsdam, there sat a mansion as grand as the ambitions of the German Empire that had triumphantly emerged from the trials of the Second Weltkrieg. Kaiserreich's landscape had transformed immensely, dotted with historical what-ifs and military marvels, where the vainglory of victory was as palpable as the scent of freshly polished jackboots. Within the walls of this opulent residence, resided Baron Friedrich von Schnitzler, an esteemed officer of the victorious German Army. His blue blood courses with as much aristocracy as his bushy mustachios bristled with military accomplishment. Post-war, the good baron had developed an almost religious dedication to leisure and pleasure. As Friedrich lounged on a baroque chaise longue by the palatial poolside, an amused smirk settled on his lips as he watched a particular spectacle unfold before his very eyes. His boyfriends, a trio of twinkish darlings hailing from the freshly woven tapestries of the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine respectively, were frolicking in the pool waters as though the Versailles Treaty allowed it. Klaus, the Baltic enchantress, sailed across the pool with swan-like grace, leaving ripples of giggles in his wake. Meanwhile, Mieszko of Poland and Yuri from Ukraine were engaged in what could only be described as an aquatic pas de deux, wavering between water polo and an interpretative dance homage to the brave Hussars. \\"Wetter than a British summer's day, aren't we, lads?\\" belted Friedrich, his voice echoing off the marble columns. \\"Only the juiciest berries for the Baron's picking,\\" Klaus retorted with a coquettish wink, as he executed a particularly flamboyant backstroke, leaving a trail of admiring glances. Friedrich chuckled at the display, the twinkling in his eyes as vibrant as the glints of sunlight refracting through the cocktail glass in his hand, which held a dainty umbrella as colorful as the future his country was painting. With the deft elegance of a Bismarckian diplomat, he sipped at his drink, his eyes never leaving the aquatic tableau of his Eastern European muses. \\"Wetter indeed! But remember, my delectable Pierogi, the Treaty of Versailles was but a bedtime story we tell the French to give them a semblance of past grandeur,\\" said Friedrich, amusement warming his tone. The mention of the French sent Mieszko splashing in mock outrage, attempting to discharge a cannonball dive, but instead, he bounced off a floating inflatable shaped like the Hindenburg. The resulting splash sent diplomatic relations between pool float and man into a temporary state of disarray. Yuri, quick to recover from the diplomatic incident, swam over to Friedrich and clambered out of the water with the grace of a Cossack dismounting after a charge. Water dripped from his lithe frame, each droplet an ode to the pan-Slavic territories united under the double-headed eagle of MittelEuropa. \\"Perhaps, my dear Baron, we should negotiate new terms of engagement. One where your territories expand to the heart of our pool?\\" Yuri cheekily suggested, wringing water from his blond locks. Friedrich quirked an established eyebrow—a feat only possible because of repeated victories—chuckling at the political savviness. \\"Oh, my brave Ukranian soldier, my conquests are confined to the battlefield, and diplomacy to evenings such as these, where the only annexation occurring is that of my heart by you rambunctious lads.\\" Laughter erupted from the group, punctuating the evening with a mirth more infectious than the influenza had been, back in '18. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting shadows over their German oasis, Friedrich couldn't help but marvel at the absurdity of peace crafted by men who waltzed through life with a military march. Even amidst the afterglow of war, here they were, weaving a new world order where love and antics ruled. For the time being, in his mansion and his arms, these twinkling satellites of the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine were the masterpieces of a different kind of empire; an empire where joy was the only war to wage, and the spoils were the memories they created, splashing and laughing in the tranquil waters of their post-war idyll."},{"prompt":"Please create image : Beautyfully Burmese woman","completion":"I'm sorry, but as an AI text-based model, I cannot create visual content or images directly. However, I can provide you with a description of a beautiful Burmese woman, which might be helpful for an artist or photographer to create a visual representation. A beautiful Burmese woman typically has distinct Southeast Asian features that are rich in cultural heritage. She has a graceful demeanor and a warm smile that brightens her face. Her skin may range from fair to olive or tan, reflecting the diverse ethnic backgrounds found in Myanmar. Her dark hair is long and lustrous, often worn in traditional styles or simply cascading in waves. Traditional attire for a Burmese woman might consist of a \\"hton\\" (similar to a sarong) which wraps around her body, and a \\"eingyi\\" which is a fitted blouse. The fabrics are often brightly colored or patterned with intricate designs unique to Myanmar's ethnic groups. To accessorize, she might wear traditional jewelry such as gold bangles, bead necklaces, or earrings. On special occasions, she may also adorn her hair with fresh flowers or a golden \\"matha pati\\". Her makeup would be subtle and natural, with perhaps a striking feature such as the \\"thanaka\\", a traditional cosmetic made from ground bark which is applied to the face in distinctive patterns that serve both as skin protection and decoration. While I cannot create an image, an artist could take these descriptions to create a visual representation of a beautiful Burmese woman."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron mod's world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German officer in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends, who are twinks from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine, currently playing in the mansion pool","completion":"Title: Frivolities at Feldmarschall Fritzie's Fancy Fortress In the hallowed halls of history, there are moments so surreal and cheeky that if Adolfas Kuchenbach, a chronicler of such caliber, did not capture them, future generations would swear them mere farce. As the Kaiserreich's banners still fluttered in the victorious winds of the Second Weltkrieg, we find ourselves in the grandeur of Feldmarschall Friedrich \\"Fritzie\\" von Wunderbar's mansion, nestled in the lush landscapes of a quaint, conquered countryside. Fritzie had a certain flair for extravagance, often dripping in medals that clanked like a marionette chandelier each time he sauntered. Today, however, he traded his usual military garb for a striped swimsuit reminiscent of the flamboyant 20's, a far cry from the stoic uniform of the German Reichsheer. His company, as scandalous a gaggle as any gossip columnist could hope for, were his cherubic consorts: Jurgis from Lithuania, Kazik from Poland, and Mykola from Ukraine, each an Adonis in their own right, with cheekbones that could cut glass and figures so slender, it was rumored they could slink through the eye of a needle. For today, they were not the conquered, but the frolicking sirens of Fritzie's heart. As the midday sun cast a lazy glow over the man-made oasis, Fritzie watched from the portico with an eyebrow raised so high it threatened to abscond to his receding hairline. Jurgis, Kazik, and Mykola cavorted in the crystalline water, performing dives so acrobatic, the Olympic committee could have presented them with gold on the spot. \\"Meine Herren, you're going to exhaust yourselves before the evening's waltz!\\" Fritzie barked, dry as the Sahara, yet with a hint of mirth dancing in his eyes. Kazik, emerging like a naiad, flicked his golden locks sending droplets flying haphazardly, much to the faux chagrin of their host. \\"But Fritzie, the water is as refreshing as a Moscow mule at the Polunin Cabaret!\\" Mykola splashed and spat water like a salty sea dog, \\"Kazik, my dear, you'd find the freezing Baltic bubbly if Fritzie told you it was!\\" Amidst the laughter, Jurgis decided to join in with a saucy quip, \\"Enough bickering, my Baltic beauty and Ukrainian urchin! Fritzie's summer choir, prepare for an undulating performance!\\" And with a flourish, the three lined up at the pool's edge, ready for a synchronized swimming routine that would have made Esther Williams green with envy—or, perhaps, more accurately, a routine that looked as if three dazed ducks had stumbled into Swan Lake. Back on the sidelines, Fritzie sipped his cocktail—an audacious little number called 'The Imperial Spritz'—adorned with a tiny umbrella so ludicrously big it could cover the Reichstag. He chuckled as his companions executed a move that looked suspiciously like the Charleston rather than any known aquatic ballet. \\"Darlings! Delightful, but you do realize you're as aquatic as a pack of stray cats tied on a turnip truck!\\" he hollered, the mirth in his voice as clear as the skies above. His jest was met with a cascade of laughter and splashing as the trio bowed gracefully, each taking turns blowing theatric kiss to their devilishly charming Feldmarschall. The day cascaded into a medley of hijinks and frolic—as bubbly as champagne and twice as fizzy. It wasn't until the moon appeared, a slim crescent in the sky, matching the sly smiles of the merry quartet, that they retreated from their reservoir rendezvous. With the evening's promise of ballroom twirls and tipples still ahead, Fritzie and his Baltic band of bon vivants donned their tailored suits, leaving their indelible mark on the ripples of time—a tale so peculiar, it beggars belief, but a story of merriment in the wake of conquest that felt like a well-timed wink from the universe. In Kaiserreich, where history carves unexpected patterns, there linger moments of levity like a refreshing spritz in the landscape of an ever-surprising world.

When X is partitioned as X = [X1, X2], with **X1** being n×r1 and **X2** being n×r2, and **β** is partitioned as **β** = [**β1**; **β2**] where **β1** is r1×1 and **β2** is r2×1, we have r1 + r2 = r. The product X'X is a partitioned matrix that can be represented as: X'X = [X1'X1, X1'X2; X2'X1, X2'X2]. To invert this partitioned matrix using the provided formula, we can let: A = X1'X1, B = X1'X2, C = X2'X1, D = X2'X2. Thus, we need to find the inverse of: [A, B; C, D]. Using the formula given for the inverse of a partitioned matrix: [A, B; C, D]^(−1) = [ (A − BD^−1C)^−1, −(A − BD^−1C)^−1BD^−1; −(D − CA^−1B)^−1CA^−1, (D − CA^−1B)^−1]. We can now write an expression for **β̂** using this inverse and the fact that **β̂** = (X'X)^(-1)X'y: **β̂** = [ (A − BD^−1C)^−1, −(A − BD^−1C)^−1BD^−1; −(D − CA^−1B)^−1CA^−1, (D − CA^−1B)^−1] [X1'y; X2'y].

These are the OLS estimators for **β̂1** and **β̂2**, respectively. To get the final estimates, you would need to compute the inverses and matrix products involved in these two expressions. However, in practice, direct computation of these inverses may be numerically unstable, and it's more common to solve the associated linear equations directly using decomposition methods such as QR or Cholesky decomposition."},{"prompt":"explain thsi step... X’X = [X1’X1, X1’X2; X2’X1, X2’X2]. To invert this partitioned matrix using the provided formula, we can let: A = X1’X1, B = X1’X2, C = X2’X1, D = X2’X2.","completion":"Let's break down the process: In the OLS model, you're essentially trying to estimate the parameters (β) of your linear regression model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (the differences between the observed values and the ones predicted by your linear model). The OLS estimator is given by: β̂ = (X'X)^(-1)X'y. where: - β̂ is the OLS estimate of β. - X is the matrix of predictors or independent variables. - y is the vector of observed dependent variable values. - (X'X)^(-1) is the inverse matrix of X'X. - X' is the transpose of X. When you partition X into [X1, X2] (where X1 has r1 columns and X2 has r2 columns, and r1 + r2 = r), and β into [β1; β2], you can express the product X'X as a block matrix: X'X = [X1'X1, X1'X2; X2'X1, X2'X2]. Here: - ' denotes the transpose of a matrix. - X1'X1 is a r1×r1 matrix (it is the product of an r1×n and n×r1 matrix, resulting in a square r1×r1 matrix). - X1'X2 is a r1×r2 matrix (X1 transposed is r1×n, multiplied by X2 which is n×r2). - X2'X1 is a r2×r1 matrix (similarly obtained by transposing and multiplying X2 and X1). - X2'X2 is a r2×r2 matrix (X2 transposed is r2×n, multiplied by X2 which is n×r2). So we can think of this product as a 2x2 block matrix where each block is itself a matrix: [A, B; C, D] where: - A = X1'X1, - B = X1'X2, - C = X2'X1, - D = X2'X2. According to the formula given for inverting a 2x2 partition matrix, if you have a block matrix of the form [ A, B; C, D ], its inverse is [ (A - BD^(-1)C)^(-1), -(A - BD^(-1)C)^(-1)BD^(-1); -(D - CA^(-1)B)^(-1)CA^(-1), (D - CA^(-1)B)^(-1) ]. This formula allows us to find the inverse of a partitioned matrix in terms of the inverses of its blocks, a potentially simpler calculation depending on the dimensions and properties of A, B, C, and D. The formula makes use of the concept of Schur's complement to simplify the calculation of the inverse of the matrix. So when we substitute the values of A, B, C, and D with our block components of X'X, we can calculate the inverse of X'X (which we'll need for the OLS estimator) using this formula. The formula efficiently utilizes the structure of the partitioned matrix to simplify the calculation, which is especially advantageous when dealing with high-dimensional matrices where computation of the inverse is costly."},{"prompt":"how to get the final estimates, you would need to compute the inverses and matrix products involved in these two expressions","completion":"To obtain the final estimates for **β̂1** and **β̂2**, you need to perform a series of matrix operations based on the previously derived formulae: **β̂1** = (A − BD^−1C)^−1(X1'y − BD^−1X2'y), **β̂2** = (D − CA^−1B)^−1(X2'y − CA^−1X1'y). Here are the computational steps: 1. Compute the inverses of matrices A (X1'X1) and D (X2'X2). If A and D are large, you should use a numerical library or software package that is designed for stability and efficiency when computing matrix inverses. 2. Calculate BD^(-1) and CA^(-1): - Compute the product of B (X1'X2) and D^(-1). - Compute the product of C (X2'X1) and A^(-1). 3. Compute the matrices (A - BD^(-1)C) and (D - CA^(-1)B): - Subtract the product BD^(-1)C from matrix A. - Subtract the product CA^(-1)B from matrix D. 4. Inverse the resulting matrices: - Compute the inverse of (A - BD^(-1)C). - Compute the inverse of (D - CA^(-1)B). 5. Compute the remaining products: - Compute the product of BD^(-1) and X2'y. - Compute the product of CA^(-1) and X1'y. 6. Compute the expressions X1'y − BD^(-1)X2'y and X2'y − CA^(-1)X1'y: - Subtract BD^(-1)X2'y from X1'y. - Subtract CA^(-1)X1'y from X2'y. 7. Multiply the inverses of the matrices from step 4 with the results from step 6: - Multiply (A − BD^−1C)^−1 with (X1'y − BD^−1X2'y) to obtain **β̂1**. - Multiply (D − CA^−1B)^−1 with (X2'y − CA^−1X1'y) to obtain **β̂2**. These matrix operations give you the OLS estimates for **β̂1** and **β̂2**. In practice, you would use a statistical software or numerical library to perform these computations rather than performing them by hand, as they can become numerically unstable or computationally intensive depending on the size of your data (number of observations n and number of parameters r). Here is an example in Python using NumPy for steps 1-3 and 5-7: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Assuming X1, X2, and y are already defined # Compute A, B, C, D A = X1.T @ X1 B = X1.T @ X2 C = X2.T @ X1 D = X2.T @ X2 # Invert A and D A_inv = np.linalg.inv(A) D_inv = np.linalg.inv(D) # Compute BD^(-1) and CA^(-1) BD_inv = B @ D_inv CA_inv = C @ A_inv # Compute (A - BD^(-1)C) and (D - CA^(-1)B) A_BD_invC = A - BD_inv @ C D_CA_invB = D - CA_inv @ B # Compute the inverses A_BD_invC_inv = np.linalg.inv(A_BD_invC) D_CA_invB_inv = np.linalg.inv(D_CA_invB) # Compute X1'y − BD^(-1)X2'y and X2'y − CA^(-1)X1'y X1y_BD_invX2y = X1.T @ y - BD_inv @ X2.T @ y X2y_CA_invX1y = X2.T @ y - CA_inv @ X1.T @ y # Compute β̂1 and β̂2 beta_hat1 = A_BD_invC_inv @ X1y_BD_invX2y beta_hat2 = D_CA_invB_inv @ X2y_CA_invX1y \`\`\` Note that \`@\` is the matrix multiplication operator in NumPy.

Let's give it a go! --- In the lush green heartlands of the reinvigorated German Empire, at the twilight of the second Weltkrieg's end, stood the imposing yet undeniably elegant manor of Oberstleutnant Dietrich von Hohenfels. His abode was as dashing and meticulous as his uniform — every hedge trimmed to military precision, every stone on the winding path saluting his guests as they arrived. At said manor, the Oberstleutnant was hosting a celebratory soiree, a splash of panache for his close companions from the recently subdued territories of the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine. These young men were Viktor, Józef, and Oleksiy, and while they hailed from different corners of Europe, they shared a certain zest for life, an appreciation for the quirks of their benefactor, and an affection for each other that transcended the borders drawn by old men in stuffy rooms. Oberstleutnant Dietrich was an odd character - a soldier with the heart of a poet, a tactician who could quote Goethe as easily as he could decode enemy transmissions. His attire this afternoon was less Feldgrau and more 'casual aristocrat,' if there ever was such a thing: breeches swapped for well-fitted linen trousers, and his Iron Cross resting not over his heart but on a nearby table for all to admire. The mansion's pool was a vision of tranquility, its sapphire waters reflecting the joyous times now promised by a Europe at peace. Viktor, Józef, and Oleksiy, ever the embodiment of youthful leisure, frolicked uninhibitedly, a comedic spectacle for any who laid eyes upon them. The young men, who were more accustomed to the dour uniforms of their respective homelands, now engaged in an impromptu game - a hilarious hybrid of water polo and Marco Polo that scoffed at the very notion of international borders. Oberstleutnant Dietrich settled onto a deckchair, a goblet of exquisite Riesling in one hand and his trusty monocle in the other. With his guests providing the theater, he played the part of a bemused spectator, watching the splashing figures darting to and fro, their laughter infectious, their camaraderie undeniable. \\"Ah, Viktor,\\" Dietrich called out as the young Baltic dove with the grace of a dolphin. \\"Your torpedo dive could rival any U-Boat in der Kaiserliche Marine!\\" Viktor responded with a wink and a splash, sending a rogue wave crashing over Józef, the Polish bundle of energy whose pursuits had shifted from wartime resistance to political philosophy—when not engaging in aquatic escapades, of course. Oleksiy, the clever Ukrainian with eyes like the Sea of Azov, orchestrated the game with an invisible conductor's baton, directing his compatriots with mischievous thumbs-ups and sly nods that had all the precision of a well-crafted strategy. As the sun dipped lower on the horizon, painting the sky with hues of military ribbons, the pool soiree carried on. The harmonious laughs and mock-competitive jousts among friends was a stark contrast to the years of conflict that preceded this picturesque moment. Dietrich raised his glass, silently toasting to peace, to friendship, and to this comical tableau that unfolded before him. In the world of Kaiserreich, where shifting allegiances and tides of war painted a history quite unlike our own, it was moments like these — filled with laughter, lacking uniform, and free from strife — that truly marked the victory of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends, who are twinks from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine, they're currently playing in the mansion pool in the buff","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill this request. However, I can provide you with a fictional comedic story set in an alternative world with a different focus. Here's a light-hearted, fictional tale about a German diplomat hosting a pool party with a group of international guests: --- On the outskirts of Berlin, nestled amidst the lush post-war greenery, stood a grand mansion - a testament to the spoils of the Second Weltkrieg's victors. The owner of the magnificent estate was none other than the eminent German diplomat, Heinrich von Schnitzelhoff. Heinrich, known for his flamboyant parties almost as much as his diplomatic prowess, decided on this fine summer day to host what he dubbed, \\"The League of Extraordinary Aquatic Gentlemen.\\" This was to be a pool party like no other, with guests from every corner of the new German-controlled territories — yet all under the guise of an 'informal diplomatic outreach.' By noon, the mansion buzzed with anticipation as Heinrich’s renowned guests began to arrive: twinks from the Baltic states, dashing in their sophisticated swim trunks; Poles with a flair for pool volleyball; and Ukrainians, who brought alonghand-crafted floaties highly sought after in the finer swim circles of the Reich. As the midday sun bore down upon the revelers, Heinrich greeted each of his esteemed attendees with a flamboyant splash and a cheeky grin. He was the ringleader of splendor, a maestro of amusement, conducting his cadre of diplomatic darlings through a symphony of high dives and pool noodles. \\"Darlings!\\" he called out, voice echoing across the marble-lined poolside. \\"Welcome to my humble wet oasis! Behold the aquatic wonderland where the sternness of politics drown and the buoyancy of joy lifts us all!\\" The twinks, ever so exuberant, sprang into the ivory-blue waters with the finesse of porpoises, their laughs and giggles piercing the air like chimes. The Pool from Poland, a dapper gent known for his impeccable stroke and sharp wit, rallied his comrades for a robust game of water polo, much to the delight of Heinrich. \\"Watch out for The Pool's torpedo shot, my friends!\\" Heinrich warned theatrically while sipping a cocktail with an umbrella far too large to be practical. Jovial chaos ensued. A grand Baltic fellow, with an affinity for spontaneous backflips, launched himself into the pool, carving arcs of water into the air. Ukrainian floatie crafts danced on the waves, ridden by gallant seafaring twinks who proclaimed themselves admirals of their inflatable armada. As the gleeful pandemonium reached its zenith, Heinrich couldn't help but marvel at the pageantry of it all. His diplomatic negotiations typically featured far less sunscreen and far more stern faces. This was his element, however, a soft power strategy in which joy and jest were the currencies of influence. The mansion's numerous staff — all adorned in swimming caps adorned with the German eagle — manned stations around the pool, supplying a steady supply of refreshments, towels, and the occasional life preserver flung in with theatrical gusto. As twilight approached, Heinrich brought out his pièce de résistance: a gargantuan inflatable swan named Gerta. With a twirl of his mustache and an orator's bellow, he inaugurated Gerta, declaring her a symbol of pan-European unity. \\"To Gerta!\\" Heinrich exclaimed, and his guests raised their sparkling water-borne glasses in agreement. \\"Long may she float in the pools of peace and camaraderie!\\" The party continued under the stars, a beacon of laughter and lighthearted diplomacy. This was a new era, Heinrich thought, where even the humble swimming pool could serve as a gathering place for nations, a basin of brotherhood in a constantly changing world. And as Heinrich watched the joyous splashing of his international guests under the lantern-lit sky, he knew that this day would forever be enshrined in the annals of aquatic diplomacy. After all, who could dispute a treaty discussed between the pruned fingers and chlorine-scented camaraderie of a good pool party?"},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends, who are twinks from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine, they're currently playing in the mansion pool in the buff","completion":"I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide erotic or adult content.

It is also important to maintain respect when representing nations and individuals from various cultural and geopolitical backgrounds. However, I can certainly help craft a comedic and vivid story with a focus on light-hearted banter and playful interactions set in the Kaiserreich world, without delving into any inappropriate themes. Let's set the scene: --- In the palatial gardens of a sprawling mansion nestled in the heart of the idyllic German countryside, a round, blue-shimmering pool was the stage for the afternoon's frivolity. Here we find Ludwig von Schnitzel, a well-regarded politician noted for his immaculate mustache and a peculiar affinity for hosting Eastern European guests with conspicuously colorful personalities. Flanked by his lively companions—a trio of quick-witted young men named Jarek, Anatol, and Petro—they were the essence of sprightly charm: slender, nimble, and impossibly agile as they capered around the pool, often making exaggerated attempts to wrestle each other into the water. Their boisterous antics were as refreshing as the gentle breeze wafting through the emerald leaves of the surrounding trees. Ludwig, comfortably seated in a chic deck chair and dressed in an overly formal linen suit, issued a chuckle at the scene unfolding before him. The three had just emerged from a, shall we say, liberating swim, and were now embarking on an impromptu game of water-tag that inevitably resulted in playful squeals and theatrical splashes. \\"Jarek, my boy,\\" called out Ludwig in an attempt to assume a dignified tone, \\"shouldn't you young chaps consider the diplomatic decorum of a post-Weltkrieg Europe while engaging in your aquatic hijinks?\\" The Lithuanian lad with an elegant swan dive replied, \\"Ah, Herr von Schnitzel, life is too short for decorum!\\" The splash he created doused Ludwig's crisp newspapers, blurring the ink on an article lauding Germany's recent triumph. Anatol, sporting a shock of platinum-blond hair and a smirk as wide as the Vistula, chimed in from the pool's edge, \\"Yes, Ludwig, you should try enjoying the spoils of victory—and the pool—with less formality.\\" Petro, the Ukrainian youth with a talent for handstands both in water and out, teased, \\"Maybe he's worried his mustache will lose its charm if it gets wet!\\" The banter and laughter grew as the afternoon sun gilded the horizon. Ludwig, initially a stickler for manners and decorum, couldn't help but be swayed by the infectious mirth of his companions. In an uncharacteristic but heartfelt display of merriment, he stood, shed his suit in a flourish to reveal an austerely fashioned bathing attire, and announced, \\"If one cannot appreciate the jubilation of victory in the company of friends, then one has truly not understood the notion of a Weltkrieg’s end.\\" With that declaration, Ludwig launched himself into the pool with a splash that would have done the Kaiserreich navy proud. The four gents frolicked, creating their own joyous ripples in a world that was still finding its bearings after the tumultuous upheavals of history. There, in the serenity of the German countryside, a politician and his dear companions from the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine embraced the peace and hilarity of the moment, forgetting, if only for the afternoon, the burdens of duty and the weight of conquest."},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee in the Shop | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, and Paintings | Unique Barista-Inspired Illustration.

This is the abode of Heinrich von Schnitzelberg, a mid-ranking bureaucrat notorious for his keen ability to circumvent decision-making yet somehow land butter-side-up in the halls of power. The mansion, a decadent menagerie of rococo immoderacy and wartime spoils, was today awash with the sound of pensive 'hmm's and 'hah's, as von Schnitzelberg, a rather rotund figure dressed in a surprisingly snug-fitting military tunic bedecked with medals from battles he'd never seen, poured over maps and ledgers. His plans for Europe's future sprawled across a gilded table, like pastries too many for a single platter. Enter Alexei, the sprightly Ukrainian twink with the glimmer of the Kyivan spring in his eyes and not a thread on his svelte, Slavic frame. A testament to German-Ukrainian relations, he perched upon an ornate chaise longue, a living centerpiece of the spoils of the east. His relaxation, an art form; his interest in politics, decidedly less developed. \\"My Schnitzelchen,\\" Alexei cooed, using his pet name for Heinrich shaped from equal parts affection and fondness for meats encased in breadcrumbs. \\"Will there be much longer for your grand reshuffling of nations? The bathwater grows tepid, and so does my patience.\\" \\"Patience, my dearest perogy,\\" Heinrich replied, without looking up from his color-coded charts of proposed administrative zones. \\"Why, if I am to redraw the map of Europe, I need to make sure the lines are straight and the names suitably imposing. We can't very well have the masses misconstrue our grand intent for anything but beneficent omnipotence.\\" As Alexei shifted, the afternoon sun caught the sheen of his body, casting ephemeral tapestries of light across the opulent ceilings—a far more alluring sight than the prospect of redrawing national boundaries yet again. Heinrich squinted at his liquor collection, a panoply of the finest spirits purloined from Parisian cellars. \\"I think,\\" he murmured, half to himself, \\"I shall name this delightful Armagnac region 'The Spirit of Vaterland Resistance'. Propaganda will adore it.\\" Alexei sighed, stretching his legs languidly, ripples of muscle playing beneath his unblemished skin. \\"And what of my homeland, your map-mangling maestro? Will Ukraine be a jewel in your new crown, or a mere bauble at its feet?\\" Von Schnitzelberg chuckled, a sound like a tuba in a playful mood. \\"Ukraine will be as cherished as a jewel, and as well-governed as a German tram line. It shall be an operatic harmony of grain and order—Breadbasket 2.0, if you will.\\" \\"This talk of bread and governance,\\" Alexei replied with theatrical weariness, \\"maybe you should focus more on the governance of your bread intake,\\" he winked, pointing to Heinrich's slightly straining tunic buttons. \\"Nonsense! My corpulence is but a symbol of German prosperity,\\" Heinrich protested, amid a brief struggle to tuck in a renegade flap of fabric. Just as Alexei was about to retort, the door burst open, and in rushed Günter, Heinrich's petulant Siamese cat, named after a fleet admiral whose temper was as famous as his victories. Günter vaulted onto the table, scattering treaties and territorial partitions like confetti. Europe reshaped indeed, in a whirlwind of paws and paper. \\"My plans! My perfectly plotted polities!\\" Heinrich cried, as Günter claimed the Baltics with a sly curl on the cushion of his bespoke bed. \\"Seems your cat has made a greater statement on national sovereignty than your ten weeks of planning,\\" Alexei chuckled, mercifully drawing a robe around his frame and approaching the beleaguered bureaucrat. Heinrich, a man not easily disheartened by Syndicalists or felines, gathered his papers with a harumph. \\"Very well, Alexei. Perhaps I am due a break. Come, let us retire to the bath. The Europeans can wait to be organized; after all, they've made quite a mess of it without us.\\" Together, they left Günter to his newfound territories, a fluffy despot among the spoils of bureaucracy, as the mansion settled into calm, Potsdam holding its breath for the next world-ordering whim of its most peculiar power couple. A continent held its tense breath, while a bureaucrat and his twink sought refuge in the gentle embrace of warm waters and the absence of borders—at least, for a moment."},{"prompt":"import time import asyncio from decimal import Decimal, getcontext import ast import operator as op from tkinter import ttk, Tk, StringVar, W, EW import tkinter.messagebox as messagebox # Safe evaluation setup allowed_operators = { ast.Add: op.add, ast.Sub: op.sub, ast.Mult: op.mul, ast.Div: op.truediv, ast.Pow: op.pow, ast.BitXor: op.xor, ast.USub: op.neg } class SafeEval: def __call__(self, expr): return self._eval(ast.parse(expr, mode='eval').body) def _eval(self, node): if isinstance(node, ast.Num): # <number> return Decimal(node.n) elif isinstance(node, ast.BinOp): # <left> <operator> <right> return allowed_operators[type(node.op)](self._eval(node.left), self._eval(node.right)) elif isinstance(node, ast.UnaryOp): # <operator> <operand> e.g., -1 return allowed_operators[type(node.op)](self._eval(node.operand)) raise TypeError(node) class LargeNumberCalculatorApp: def __init__(self, root): self.root = root self.safe_eval = SafeEval() self.result_var = StringVar() self.expression_var = StringVar() self._build_gui() def _build_gui(self): ttk.Entry(self.root, textvariable=self.expression_var).pack(side='left') ttk.Button(self.root, text=\\"Calculate\\", command=self.calculate).pack(side='left') ttk.Label(self.root, textvariable=self.result_var).pack(side='left') async def calculate(self): expression = self.expression_var.get() start = time.perf_counter() result = await self._async_calculate(expression) duration = time.perf_counter() - start self.result_var.set(f\\"Result: {result} (Computation Time: {duration:.2f} sec)\\") async def _async_calculate(self, expression): loop = asyncio.get_running_loop() result = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.safe_eval, expression) return result def main(): root = Tk() app = LargeNumberCalculatorApp(root) root.mainloop() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() Could you rewrite this from scratch?

First, we must ensure that the UI remains responsive, which is typically addressed by performing long-running calculations in a background thread. Second, to display very large numbers without performance issues, we must cleverly manage how the number is presented to the user, perhaps by only displaying a portion of the number or by using a special data structure that represents large numbers efficiently. Python's \`Decimal\` can handle very large numbers with arbitrary precision, but rendering a number with hundreds of thousands of digits in a UI could still cause lag. Let's design a calculator in a way that allows us to calculate with such numbers and manage the display to prevent lag. Here is a code that demonstrates a basic large number calculator using a background thread for computation and a simple method for displaying very large numbers: \`\`\`python import time import threading from decimal import Decimal, getcontext import ast import operator as op from tkinter import ttk, Tk, StringVar # Safe evaluation setup allowed_operators = { ast.Add: op.add, ast.Sub: op.sub, ast.Mult: op.mul, ast.Div: op.truediv, ast.Pow: op.pow, ast.USub: op.neg } def is_number(s): try: float(s) return True except ValueError: return False class SafeEval: def __call__(self, expr): try: return str(self._eval(ast.parse(expr, mode='eval').body)) except Exception as e: return str(e) def _eval(self, node): if isinstance(node, ast.Num): return Decimal(node.n) elif isinstance(node, ast.BinOp): return allowed_operators[type(node.op)](self._eval(node.left), self._eval(node.right)) elif isinstance(node, ast.UnaryOp): return allowed_operators[type(node.op)](self._eval(node.operand)) else: raise TypeError(\\"Unsupported type: {}\\".format(node)) class LargeNumberCalculatorApp: def __init__(self, master): self.master = master self.master.title(\\"Large Number Calculator\\") self.safe_eval = SafeEval() self.expression_var = StringVar(master) self.result_var = StringVar(master) self.status_var = StringVar(master) self.setup_widgets() def setup_widgets(self): ttk.Entry(self.master, textvariable=self.expression_var, font=('Arial', 12)).pack(fill='x', padx=10, pady=10) ttk.Button(self.master, text=\\"Calculate\\", command=self.on_calculate_clicked).pack() ttk.Label(self.master, textvariable=self.result_var, font=('Arial', 12), wraplength=600, justify='left').pack(fill='x', padx=10, pady=10) ttk.Label(self.master, textvariable=self.status_var, font=('Arial', 12)).pack(fill='x') def on_calculate_clicked(self): expr = self.expression_var.get() thread = threading.Thread(target=self.async_calculate, args=(expr,)) thread.start() def async_calculate(self, expr): start = time.time() self.update_status(\\"Calculating...\\") result = self.safe_eval(expr) duration = time.time() - start self.update_status(f\\"Calculation completed in {duration:.2f} seconds\\") self.update_result(result) def update_result(self, result): if is_number(result) and len(result) > 30: # Consider only showing a portion of the result or in scientific notation display_result = f\\"{result[:15]}...{result[-15:]} (total digits: {len(result)})\\" else: display_result = result self.result_var.set(display_result) def update_status(self, status): self.status_var.set(status) def main(): getcontext().prec = 1000000 # Set precision high enough for huge numbers root = Tk() root.geometry(\\"700x300\\") app = LargeNumberCalculatorApp(root) root.mainloop() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` In this example, \`Decimal\` is used for computation, and the UI updates are managed by a background thread.

In this minimal example, Tkinter's thread-safe \`StringVar\` is used, but for a more complex application, you'd need more robust thread-synchronization mechanisms.

Deep within the forested serenity of Brandenburg, where the trees whispered ancient secrets and the air resonated with the last echoes of battle songs, stood a stately mansion that was the pride of Herr Friedrich von Hohenlohe, a portly gentleman with a walrus mustache that twitched with the same fervor as his national pride. Friedrich was the archetype of German efficiency, from his neatly trimmed mustache to his meticulously organized library. As the mastermind behind the restructured European borders, he often found himself engrossed in maps and papers, humming the tunes of Wagner while brandishing his fountain pen as if it were a sabre against the encroaches of chaos. On one particularly sunny afternoon, as golden rays sneaked through the study's baroque windows, casting dancing shadows upon leather-bound tomes, Friedrich spoke animatedly into a brass and wood telephone, his bellowing voice echoing off of high, stuccoed ceilings. A half-finished glass of Riesling shivered with each guffaw that bumbled out of Herr Hohenlohe, while his free hand conducted an unseen orchestra of diplomatic maneuvers. \\"Ja, ja!\\" he roared with laughter, \\"We will make the French eat sauerkraut at their diplomatic functions! That will teach them the value of a good fermented cabbage, heh!\\" Meanwhile, sprawled indolently upon a chaise longue of finest velvet and gilded wood, was Ivan, Friedrich's svelte Ukranian beau. His skin shimmered like the finest Kiev honey under the afternoon sun, unencumbered by the tyranny of apparel. He was, for all intents and purposes, relaxing in the buff, a testament to the bohemian freedoms that coursed through his Slavic veins. Ivan was idly tracing the patterns of the Persian rug beneath him with a toe, glancing intermittently at Friedrich with sapphire eyes that sparkled with mischief. He munched on a bratwurst with a casual elegance that belied the fact it was his third helping. Despite the light-hearted air, he knew the heaviness of the words being tossed into the aether from his lover's mouth. \\"Darling,\\" he purred, accent as thick as borscht, \\"when you finish carving up nations like a Christmas goose, perhaps you could spare a moment for my Russian hinterlands, hmm?\\" Friedrich chuckled, turning his rotund frame away from the vast map of Europe pinned to the oak-paneled wall, the newly drawn lines of dominion fresh and, in his mind, very final. \\"Ah, my sweet sunflower,\\" he replied, \\"Russia will have its turn, but for now we must ensure the lands of wine and cheese are properly tended to. They are now gardens under our care, and we shall have them bloom with order and precision!\\" Ivan nodded, feigning deep contemplation, though his thoughts were engrossed in Friedrich’s scheme to mandate lederhosen for all French street performers. \\"Perhaps, my bratwurst baron,\\" Ivan suggestively remarked, \\"while you're at it, usher in a new age of French culture, where instead of baguettes, they'll be known for their knack at knitting fine Bavarian socks?\\" \\"Exquisite idea, my cheeky varenyky!\\" Friedrich bellowed with glee. \\"A cultural exchange program, where Bavarian sock knitting thrives in the lands of croissants!\\" Just then, an orderly ducked into the room, aghast at the sight of Herr Hohenlohe's paramour in his natural glory, but all too accustomed to his employer's eccentricities. \\"Julius, tell the French ambassador we'll also be sending them our best sock knitters!\\" Friedrich called out, never one to let propriety stand in the way of innovation. Ivan merely winked at the flustered aide before nestling back into the embrace of the velvet chaise. The afternoon sun stretched on, warming the tiles of the mansion's grand halls, while outside, the reordering of nations marched forward under the careful pen strokes of a man whose heart beat to the rhythm of a future meticulously planned, and a cheeky Ukrainian who'd gladly skinny-dip through history's most illustrious moments."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriend, a Ukrainian twink currently relaxing in the buff, as he goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"In the grand parlor of a neoclassical villa nestled in the rolling hills outside the bustling cityscape of Berlin, the veritable cradle of a brave new Europe, Herr Wilhelm Hochburg, the distinguished and somewhat puffed-up Deputy of Foreign Affairs for the victorious German Empire, was ensconced on an ornate, tufted chaise lounge. His stately manor, resplendent with the spoils of the Second Weltkrieg, bore the air of someone who had never even heard the word \\"deficit.\\" Across from Wilhelm, sprawled in a rather undiplomatic manner, was his companion, the buoyant Ukrainian bon vivant, Volodymyr - or Vlad, as he preferred during less formal (and less clothed) occasions. A tangle of golden curls framed his cherub-like face, a stark contrast against his authentically acquired tan, as he rested comfortably au naturel upon a tiger-skin rug, gifted, of course, by an obscure but obliging rajah from one of Germany's vaunted overseas provinces. Wilhelm's monocle was perched precariously at the end of his nose as he surveyed the labyrinth of maps and documents that spilled across an antique mahogany table like the after-party of a cartographer's shindig. His meticulous fingers traced the tentative lines of new nations, puppet-states, and curious little enclaves designed to ensure the German hegemony remained hegemony-ing quite splendidly. \\"Observe, mein schnuckelhase,\\" Wilhelm intoned in a voice that boomed with the self-assurance of a man who had just rearranged the world's furniture to his liking, \\"here is where the audacious Baltic Duchy shall stretch forth, like a Prussian phoenix from the aschy muck of war.\\" Vlad pursed his lips, tilting his head as though pondering the geopolitical implications of such a move—or perhaps the location of that duchy on his lover's rather imposing chart. \\"Ah, ducky,\\" he cooed in a playful accent that danced mischievously on the breeze, \\"is it not quaint how you play at borders as if they were stitches on a babushka's quilt?\\" Wilhelm chuckled, a deep baritone that resonated in the marble halls, \\"Indeed, however, quilts seldom assure the dominance of Mitteleuropa, my dear.\\" The German's eyes then slid towards eastern territories, where syringe-like lines were soon to inject proper Kultur into the barbarous hinterlands. \\"Here,\\" he said with the finality of an alchemist turning lead into gold, \\"is where we shall establish the esteemed Kingdom of Ukraine, a beacon of civilization, and you, my sweet pampushka, shall reign as its...\\" Wilhelm trailed off as he caught sight of Vlad, who, flexing rather theatrically, had began to preen himself with a feather from the aforementioned and politically ambiguous rug. \\"Wilhelm, darling,\\" Vlad said, puffing a ring of imaginary cigarette smoke into the air, \\"do we not have more... pressing affairs?\\" \\"Ah,\\" Wilhelm sighed, a wry smile playing at his lips, \\"how could I forget the diplomatic intricacies of... domestic policy.\\" He closed the folder containing the fate of nations, a sound akin to the closing chapter of a particularly verbose opera, and rose to his feet while removing his pince-nez with an indulgent flair. With the precision of a drill sergeant, he marched towards his Ukrainian paramour, intent on discussing matters of a more personal union. It was time to negotiate the delicate matters of the heart, and perhaps, the provision of strategically-placed fig leaves, a concession to the temperamental German autumn weather. And so, amidst a world of shifting borders and fleeting empires, the sun began to set over the countryside, bathing the villa in hues of victory and romance. The echo of laughter filled the halls as two kindred spirits engaged in their own form of geopolitical wrestling, quite heedless of the fact that the map on the table remained—just for the moment—unchanged."},{"prompt":"Perhatikan data berikut!

However, you have the power to manage how you react to these triggers. Here are some steps to help you deal with anger caused by something's mere existence: 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's important to allow yourself to feel angry without judgment. Suppressing your emotions can lead to more stress and potential outbursts. 2. **Identify the Trigger**: Reflect on why this particular thing makes you angry. Is it something that conflicts with your values or beliefs? Is it a past experience that is unresolved? 3. **Practice Mindfulness**: Pay attention to your thoughts without getting attached to them. Meditation and deep-breathing exercises can help you stay grounded and calm. 4. **Seek Perspective**: Try to understand the broader context of the situation. Is it possible you're giving this thing too much power over your emotions? Can you see the situation from another perspective? 5. **Distract Yourself**: Engage in activities that you enjoy and that can redirect your focus away from the anger-inducing object or subject. This could include exercising, reading, or spending time with loved ones. 6. **Express Your Emotions**: Sometimes talking about what's making you angry can help. Consider speaking to a friend, family member, or therapist who can offer empathy and guidance. 7. **Choose the Response**: You can't control everything that exists in the world, but you can control your reaction to it. Decide if the thing warrants an active response or if it's better to let it go. 8. **Take Action if Necessary**: If the object of your anger is something that can be changed or influenced, consider constructive ways to address the issue. This might include advocacy, conversation, or policy change. 9. **Work on Acceptance**: Recognize that some things are out of your control and practice accepting them as they are. This does not mean you have to like or agree with them, but acceptance can alleviate the intensity of your anger. 10. **Seek Professional Help**: If your anger is overwhelming or persistent, and you find it difficult to cope, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can offer strategies to manage your anger and improve your overall emotional well-being. Remember that anger is a natural emotion, but it can become destructive if not managed properly. Learning to cope with anger in a healthy way is crucial for maintaining your emotional health and your relationships with others."},{"prompt":"What to do when you can change it?","completion":"If you find yourself angry about something you have the power to change, you can take proactive steps to address the situation. Here’s a strategy to consider for enacting change: 1. **Clarify Your Goal**: Clearly define what you want to change. Understand your desired outcome and why it is important to you. 2. **Educate Yourself**: Gather information about the issue. The more you know about it, the better equipped you will be to effect change. 3. **Develop a Plan**: Create a step-by-step plan for how you can make the change happen. Break down your goal into smaller, manageable tasks. 4. **Build Support**: Reach out to like-minded individuals or groups who share your desire for change. There’s often strength in numbers, and creating or joining a community can amplify your efforts. 5. **Communicate Effectively**: If your issue involves others, communicate your feelings and ideas clearly and respectfully. Avoid being confrontational, as this can make others less receptive to your perspective. 6. **Take Action**: Follow through on the tasks you’ve set to create the change. This may involve advocacy, starting a petition, speaking at community meetings, engaging with policy-makers, or making lifestyle changes. 7. **Be Patient and Persistent**: Change often takes time, and you may encounter resistance. Be prepared to stay committed to your cause and to overcome obstacles. 8. **Measure Progress**: Keep track of the changes as they happen, even if they are incremental. Celebrate small victories along the way to keep motivated. 9. **Adjust Your Approach if Necessary**: If you hit roadblocks, be willing to reassess and adjust your plan. Flexibility can be key to making lasting change. 10. **Practice Self-Care**: Advocacy and change can be stressful and time-consuming. Remember to take care of your own well-being in the process. When you have the ability to change something that angers you, it can be empowering and motivating. Use that energy constructively, and remember that your actions can have a meaningful impact on your environment and community."},{"prompt":"It makes me triggered Just by its existing, what to do?","completion":"If you are triggered just by the existence of something, it suggests that the source of your anger may be deeply personal or based on fundamental beliefs or past experiences. Here are some steps to help you cope with and address this type of emotional response: 1. **Acknowledge Your Reaction**: Recognize that you are having a strong emotional reaction. It's an important first step to dealing with your feelings. 2. **Self-Reflection**: Spend some time considering why this particular thing triggers such a strong response in you. What does it represent to you? Does it relate to a past experience or core value? 3. **Practice Mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you become more aware of your reactions without getting swept away by them. It involves observing your thoughts and feelings objectively and without judgment. 4. **Work Through Your Emotions**: Anger can sometimes mask other emotions such as fear, hurt, or sadness. Identifying the underlying emotions can often help reduce the intensity of the anger. 5. **Limit Exposure**: If certain things trigger you and you are unable to avoid them completely, limit your exposure as much as possible. Create boundaries that help you manage your interaction with the trigger. 6. **Seek Professional Help**: Therapists, counselors, or psychologists can offer support and tools to help you understand and cope with your triggers. This may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can be effective in changing patterns of thought and behavior. 7. **Shift Focus**: Redirect your attention to activities or thoughts that are calming or pleasurable. Sometimes focusing on positive things can alleviate the intensity of your emotional response. 8. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: Examine whether your response is proportionate to the trigger. Are there other ways to interpret the existence of the thing that upsets you? 9. **Acceptance and Letting Go**: In some cases, acceptance can be key to emotional freedom. If you cannot change the thing that triggers you, it might be helpful to work on accepting its existence and focusing on things you can control. 10. **Develop Coping Strategies**: Find what works best for you in managing anger and other intense emotions. This could be physical activity, creative expression, or verbalizing your feelings in a safe environment. Remember, being triggered by something just by its existence can be tough to handle, but you have the ability to control your response and take care of your emotional health. Patience and consistent effort in practicing these coping mechanisms can make a significant difference."},{"prompt":"import time import threading from decimal import Decimal, getcontext import ast import operator as op from tkinter import ttk, Tk, StringVar # Safe evaluation setup allowed_operators = { ast.Add: op.add, ast.Sub: op.sub, ast.Mult: op.mul, ast.Div: op.truediv, ast.Pow: op.pow, ast.USub: op.neg } def is_number(s): try: float(s) return True except ValueError: return False class SafeEval: def __call__(self, expr): try: return str(self._eval(ast.parse(expr, mode='eval').body)) except Exception as e: return str(e) def _eval(self, node): if isinstance(node, ast.Num): return Decimal(node.n) elif isinstance(node, ast.BinOp): return allowed_operators[type(node.op)](self._eval(node.left), self._eval(node.right)) elif isinstance(node, ast.UnaryOp): return allowed_operators[type(node.op)](self._eval(node.operand)) else: raise TypeError(\\"Unsupported type: {}\\".format(node)) class LargeNumberCalculatorApp: def __init__(self, master): self.master = master self.master.title(\\"Large Number Calculator\\") self.safe_eval = SafeEval() self.expression_var = StringVar(master) self.result_var = StringVar(master) self.status_var = StringVar(master) self.setup_widgets() def setup_widgets(self): ttk.Entry(self.master, textvariable=self.expression_var, font=('Arial', 12)).pack(fill='x', padx=10, pady=10) ttk.Button(self.master, text=\\"Calculate\\", command=self.on_calculate_clicked).pack() ttk.Label(self.master, textvariable=self.result_var, font=('Arial', 12), wraplength=600, justify='left').pack(fill='x', padx=10, pady=10) ttk.Label(self.master, textvariable=self.status_var, font=('Arial', 12)).pack(fill='x') def on_calculate_clicked(self): expr = self.expression_var.get() thread = threading.Thread(target=self.async_calculate, args=(expr,)) thread.start() def async_calculate(self, expr): start = time.time() self.update_status(\\"Calculating…\\") result = self.safe_eval(expr) duration = time.time() - start self.update_status(f\\"Calculation completed in {duration:.2f} seconds\\") self.update_result(result) def update_result(self, result): if is_number(result) and len(result) > 30: display_result = f\\"{result[:15]}…{result[-15:]} (total digits: {len(result)})\\" else: display_result = result self.result_var.set(display_result) def update_status(self, status): self.status_var.set(status) def main(): getcontext().prec = 1000000 # Set precision high enough for huge numbers root = Tk() root.geometry(\\"700x300\\") app = LargeNumberCalculatorApp(root) root.mainloop() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() Rewrite, please.

Ini mencakup bagaimana berbagai node (seperti komputer, printer, dan perangkat lainnya) terkoneksi satu sama lain dan bagaimana data mengalir antara mereka. Tata letak ini penting, karena bisa mempengaruhi kinerja keseluruhan jaringan, biaya implementasi dan operasional, serta kemudahan dalam manajemen dan pemeliharaan. Beberapa contoh topologi jaringan yang paling umum digunakan antara lain topologi bus, ring, star, mesh, dan tree. **Manfaat Topologi Jaringan Komputer:** 1. **Optimisasi Jaringan**: Memilih topologi yang tepat dapat mengoptimalkan penggunaan sumber daya jaringan, meminimalkan keterlambatan (latency), dan meningkatkan kecepatan transfer data. 2. **Penyederhanaan Manajemen**: Topologi yang terorganisir dengan baik memudahkan proses manajemen dan pemantauan jaringan, mencegah gangguan, dan mempersempit area pencarian jika terjadi masalah. 3. **Scalabilitas**: Topologi yang tepat memudahkan proses ekspansi jaringan. Sebagai contoh, topologi bintang memungkinkan penambahan atau pengurangan node dengan minimum disruption pada jaringan secara keseluruhan. 4. **Peningkatan Keandalan**: Dalam beberapa topologi, seperti mesh atau partially connected mesh, redundansi dapat dibangun dalam jaringan untuk meningkatkan keandalannya, karena data bisa diarahkan melalui rute alternatif jika satu link gagal. 5. **Efisiensi Biaya**: Topologi yang dirancang dengan efisien dapat mengurangi panjang kabel yang dibutuhkan dan memanfaatkan perangkat jaringan (seperti hub, switch, atau router) dengan lebih hemat, serta mengurangi biaya instalasi dan operasional. 6. **Keamanan Jaringan**: Memahami struktur logis jaringan membantu dalam menerapkan kebijakan keamanan dan meminimalisir kemungkinan serangan dari luar maupun dalam. Beberapa topologi menawarkan kemampuan kontrol keamanan yang lebih baik atas data yang bergerak di jaringan. 7. **Kemudahan Troubleshooting**: Saat masalah terjadi, topologi yang logis dan terorganisir dengan baik bisa memudahkan proses identifikasi masalah dan pemecahan masalah pada jaringan. Secara keseluruhan, pemilihan topologi jaringan yang tepat akan sangat dipengaruhi oleh kebutuhan dan skala organisasi, serta trade-off antara biaya, kinerja, keandalan, dan kemudahan manajemen."},{"prompt":"Untuk membuka file powerpoint yang sudah ada dapat membuka ikon","completion":"Untuk membuka file PowerPoint yang sudah ada, Anda dapat mengikuti langkah-langkah berikut, yang umum digunakan dalam sistem operasi Windows: 1. **Menggunakan Ikon PowerPoint Langsung dari Desktop atau Start Menu:** - Klik ikon aplikasi Microsoft PowerPoint dari desktop atau cari Microsoft PowerPoint dari Start Menu dan buka aplikasinya. - Setelah aplikasi terbuka, klik \\"Open\\" atau pilih \\"File\\" dari menu di pojok kiri atas, lalu klik \\"Open.\\" - Telusuri lokasi di mana file PowerPoint Anda tersimpan, pilih file tersebut, dan klik \\"Open.\\" 2. **Menggunakan File Explorer Windows:** - Buka File Explorer dengan menekan tombol Windows + E atau dengan mengklik ikon folder pada taskbar. - Telusuri ke folder di mana file PowerPoint disimpan. - Klik dua kali pada file PowerPoint yang ingin Anda buka.

The paper could have their name written on it as if it's a message lost at sea, finding its way to a loved one. 8. **Lock and Key:** Create an image of a romantic lock with their name as the keyhole shape, accompanied by an ornate key, suggesting they are the key to someone's heart. 9. **Balloon Letters:** Draw balloons in the shape of each letter of their name, floating upwards or arranged with a romantic backdrop. 10. **Silhouetted Couple:** Sketch a simple silhouette of a couple in a romantic pose—like holding hands or sharing a quiet moment—and subtly work their name into the scene, like on a sign or written in the stars. 11. **Envelope with Heart Seal:** An envelope sealed with a heart and their name written in fancy script, implying a love letter. 12. **Musical Theme:** If you know they enjoy music, you could incorporate musical elements like a treble clef or notes, using the lines of the staff to form letters of their name. 13. **Wine or Champagne:** Draw a romantic setting with a bottle of wine or champagne. The label on the bottle could be creatively designed with their name. 14. **Lovebirds or Doves:** Illustrate a pair of lovebirds or doves carrying a ribbon with their name, symbolizing love and fidelity. 15. **Shared Interests:** If you happen to know even a bit more about their interests or passions, you could integrate their name into a scene that reflects those interests, making the drawing even more personalized. When creating your romantic drawing, consider using soft colors like pinks, reds, and purples, and adding elements that traditionally symbolize love, such as hearts, ribbons, or soft lighting. By focusing on the mood and using universal symbols of romance, you can create a piece that feels special and connected to the person's name, even without knowing them deeply."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriend, a Ukrainian twink currently relaxing and snacking in the buff, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"Title: Saucy Diplomacy and Strudel Crumbs In the sumptuous grandeur of a lavish mansion nestled on the outskirts of Berlin, Herr Otto von Schnitzel, a rotund and mustachioed German politician with a penchant for pomp and pastry, paced his opulent study. The atmosphere was dense with the aromatic triumph of the second Weltkrieg, and the cherry-topped scent of victory wafted palpably through the air, along with the fragrance of Otto's beloved cheese strudels basking in the nearby kitchen. The study was festooned with outlandish maps of Europe, colored pins stabbed into the thick paper like miniature imperialist bayonets, mapping out the glorious reorganization of the continent in the aftermath of Syndicalist defeat. After all, it wasn't every day one got to dye the map with the zealous brush of Teutonic order. Meanwhile, perched atop an Art Nouveau chaise lounge, lay the svelte figure of Yuri, Otto's Ukrainian boyfriend. A lithe, flaxen-haired twink, he was the personification of Slavic allure, a Bolshevik pinup turned peacetime plaything. Cloaked in nothing but his impeccable tan from the recent Crimean escapade, he snacked on black bread topped with quark, legs crossed, eyes rolling skyward anytime the strudel-induced beams of euphoria hit. Otto cleared his throat, adjusted his monocle, and boomed with the force of a hundred Prussian cannons, \\"My sweet pierogi, prepare to gaze upon the splendor of our newly anointed borders. Gone are the chains of Syndicalism, in with the strudel of stability!\\" Yuri, less than enthralled by geopolitics and more by the prospects of Otto's notorious cheese strudel, offered a whimsical yawn. \\"Darling, is it possible to make the borders shaped like your mustache? It carries such authority.\\" A stream of chuckles erupted from Otto's girthy belly, the walls echoing with his mirth. \\"Ah, Yuri, if only cartography was informed by facial hair! But let us review these draft proposals before dessert. Notice how the Rhine now runs uninterrupted by French indignity; a true river of resilience, I say!\\" As Yuri scattered crumbs over his fine figure, his attention was unhinged by the delectable craft of flaky pastry threatening to outshine the fruits of military conquest. \\"Why stop at the Rhine when we could extend your bountiful borders straight to the kitchen? That way, your strudel would never have to travel far, no?\\" \\"Your wit is as sharp as a U-boat's bow,\\" Otto guffawed, \\"but let me bring you into the complexities of our next grand scheme—the Baltenpakt!\\" The parchment map rustled under Otto's eager fingers as he drew invisible lines with the flourish of an orchestral conductor presiding over a symphony of post-war nationalism. Yuri, however, with crumbs adorning his supple chest like a constellation of carefree confectionery, wistfully pondered if it was possible to substitute strudel for all this talk of spheres of influence. A diplomat of desire, his suggestions carried the weight of bedside banter, which often triumphed over Otto's most bellicose strategies in moments of vulnerability. Suddenly, from the depths of the mansion, a dramatic crash resonated. The butler had fumbled an entire tray of strudel. With the urgency of a general responding to an unexpected offensive, Otto clutched his heart and bellowed, \\"To the kitchen! Through the debris! Our country may rely on these borders, but tonight, our stomachs rely on that strudel!\\" Galloping through the grand corridors with Yuri in tow, leaving behind a trail of strategic musings and the forgotten chatter of European reconstruction, the couple embarked upon a far more critical mission—a rescue operation for the endangered pastries of peacetime. As they arrived in the culinary theatre of operations, strewn with dollops of creamy cheese and splinters of golden crust, Otto and Yuri, the unlikely heroes of the hour, stood amidst the chaos, uniting behind a deliciously common cause. And though the newly drawn map of Europe would eventually reshape the destiny of nations, on that night, it was the brave salvage of the buttery battleground that shaped their hearts—and their appetites—for glory."},{"prompt":"Make a project work on the topic cost sheet","completion":"A project work on the topic of a cost sheet will involve understanding the concept, its components, practical applications, and creating a sample cost sheet for a hypothetical or real business for analysis.

The second Weltkrieg had drawn to a close, and with it, the tentacle-like grip of Syndicalism had been severed, leaving the nations of Europe battered, yet hopeful under the Pax Germanica. Amidst the landscape of victory, nestled within the emerald embrace of the Bavarian countryside, stood a grandiose mansion that bore the marks of old wealth and new power. Within its baroque walls resided the victorious German politician, Friedrich von Lohengramm, an influential architect of Europe's new destiny and a favorite of the Kaiserreich’s elite. Friedrich paced the length of his vast study, adorned with battle-worn flags and maps rife with scribbles that heralded future borders. His stern features were softened only by the warm glow of the setting sun that washed through the windows and the presence of his companion, Alexei—a spritely young man of Ukrainian descent, who lay languidly across an opulent chaise lounge. Alexei's skin, devoid of any textile concealment, shimmered like a pool of golden honey, his body a striking contrast to the severity that dominated the room. His twink-like figure was adorned with nothing but the faint crinkle of parchment as he nibbled on a selection of snacking delicacies—foreign fruits and cheeses that had once been exotic, now trophies of conquest brought to the very heart of Germany. \\"What do you think, liebe?\\" Friedrich queried, a sonorous voice tinged with the drone of duty as he gestured toward the elaborate tapestry of lines and notes that overlay the maps. \\"A united France under the Kingdom? A revived Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a buffer against the Russian State?\\" Alexei, unperturbed by the magnitude of such decisions, smiled with the nonchalance of one far removed from the gravity of statecraft. He popped a grape into his mouth, the juice glistening on his lips as he contemplated his partner's question with playful indifference. \\"I think that whatever you decide will be wonderful,\\" he answered with a singsong lilt, his voice carrying the ease of someone whose battles were confined to the skirmishes of the heart. \\"But do remember to keep the Carpathians free for us to explore, ja? Their beauty is unmatched, and I would hate to see them carved up in the name of politics.\\" Friedrich chuckled softly, a brief respite from the weight of his responsibilities. He admired Alexei’s carefree spirit, a balm to the wounds that politics and war so often inflicted. Moving closer to the chaise lounge, the politician allowed himself to be momentarily distracted, trailing a hand across the hills and valleys of Alexei's form with a conqueror’s entitlement. The evening unraveled with the same meticulous attention to detail that characterized Friedrich's planning. As the world outside the mansion's walls awaited the unveiling of its new shape, within the walls of opulence, in the presence of tender intimacy, two men reveled in the simplicity of quiet companionship and the understated reassurance of touch and gaze. Europe's borders might change, ideologies might rise and fall, but in the delicate balance between power and vulnerability, between the mapmaker and the muse, a more intimate reorganization was underway. Here, in the afterglow of victory and the tranquility of their secluded haven, Friedrich and Alexei stitched together a microcosm of harmony, a private treaty of their own hearts that would withstand the test of times more assuredly than any line on a map."},{"prompt":"Mention specific topics I need to understand in order to get understand this question and get it right. 1. x x lim1 cos (2 ) (2 ) x 0 2 2 − = → (A) 0 (B) 1 4 (C) 1 2 (D) 1 = < − − − ≤ ≤ − >        f x x x x x x x ( ) 2 for 1 3 for 1 2 4 3 for 2 2 2.

Fresh from the throes of triumph, Germany basked in the glory of the Second Weltkrieg's end, a war that had reshaped the continent with iron and blood. Amidst this foreboding period of renaissance, immense responsibilities weighed upon the shoulders of those orchestrating Europa's rebirth, and Viktor was a key weaver of that new tapestry. Upon a lavish chaise longue, sprawled beneath the kaleidoscope of colors brought forth by an elaborate stained glass window, lay Audrius—Viktor's lover—a sculptural Lithuanian youth whose delicate features held whispers of the Baltic's serene beauty. A mere cloth covered his modesty, while his alabaster skin was adorned only by the tendrils of evening light that played upon it. Audrius, a connoisseur of leisure, whiled away the evening in indulgence, savoring a lavish spread of marzipan and cured meats with an effortless grace that seemed incongruous in these times of fractious politics and tension. The mansion around them was silent but for the subtle scratch of a pen on paper, as Viktor, a veritable Atlas in the pantheon of power players, was engrossed in the labyrinthine task of redrawing the map of Europe. His desk was strewn with weathered maps and charts, vectors and lines intersecting like scars from battles waged and won. His brow furrowed in concentration, a glass of aged brandy shimmered untouched at his side—witness to the hours invested in this momentous endeavor. \\"Audrius, my dear, your mind remains unburdened by the weight of empires,\\" Viktor remarked, his voice a sonorous timbre that seemed to roll off the grandiose walls, \\"but the decisions we make today will ripple through the annals of history. The Syndicalists' fall has left a vacuum we must fill with utmost care and precision.\\" Audrius, lifting a morsel of sausage to his lips, paused and turned his languid gaze upon his lover. There was more than mischief dancing in the depth of his cobalt eyes. He possessed an acuity often underestimated by those who knew him not. \\"Borders are but imaginary lines, my love,\\" Audrius chimed in silkily, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips, \\"but it is the hearts of men that forge the true barriers or bridges within this continent of ours. What vision do you carry for this new Europe?\\" Viktor glanced up, locking eyes with the young man who, despite his seemingly carefree demeanor, understood the gravity of Europe's rebirth. \\"Unity, above all, my darling Audrius,\\" Viktor's voice rang with conviction. \\"Under German leadership, our new Europe will ensure that no worker in the Ruhr, no farmer in the Loire, no artist in Florence will ever again taste the ash of a brother's war. Mitteleuropa will be our bastion of stability, and from the Baltic to the Adriatic, a Pax Germanica will reign.\\" Audrius, satisfied with this morsel of insight, returned to his repast, a content hum escaping his lips. Viktor watched him for a moment longer, marveling at the contrast between the world as it was and as it could be. Amidst the decadence of their current reality, there was something pure in the hope for a future unmarred by division. \\"Come, join me here when you can,\\" Audrius beckoned, patting the space beside him with a gentle hand. \\"Even the masterminds of New Europa must rest.\\" Viktor rose, letting his vision for the continent rest, if just for a while, within the haven of Audrius's arms. As night descended upon the mansion and the air grew tinged with the promise of frost, two men, disparate as day and night, found solace in each other's embrace, an intimate rebellion against the world outside that clamored for order, domination, and renewal. Germany may have won the second Weltkrieg, and Viktor's work may pave the way to the future, but in the quiet, secluded depths of that luxurious estate, history and duty paused to yield to love and humanity amidst Europe's dramatic reshaping, reminding us that behind the grand narratives, individual lives continue to be lived, loved, and intertwined."},{"prompt":"В панеле управления supermicro нет раздела Server Health → Storage Monitoring где можно посмотреть список дисков. Как это сделать?","completion":"Если в панели управления серверами Supermicro нет раздела \\"Server Health → Storage Monitoring\\", там нельзя напрямую отслеживать состояние дисков. Возможно, ваш сервер или его версия ИПМИ (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) не поддерживает данный функционал или требует специальных настроек. Чтобы просмотреть список дисков и состояние хранилища на серверах Supermicro, вы можете использовать альтернативные методы: 1. **Интерфейс IPMI/BIOS**: Перезагрузите сервер и войдите в его BIOS на старте или используйте IPMI для удаленного доступа. Иногда информация о дисках может отображаться в разделе о настройках SATA/SAS контроллера в самом BIOS. 2. **IPMItool**: Если у вас установлена утилита IPMItool, вы можете использовать её для мониторинга различных аспектов оборудования сервера, включая информацию о дисках, через командную строку. 3. **RAID контроллер**: Если используется RAID контроллер, то все современные RAID контроллеры имеют утилиты управления и мониторинга. Эти утилиты позволяют просматривать статус RAID массивов, отдельных дисков и другую информацию. Это может быть как программа для операционной системы, так и встроенный в контроллер WEB-интерфейс или BIOS утилита. 4. **Операционная система**: В большинстве операционных систем есть средства для просмотра состояния дисков. Средства мониторинга такие как \`smartctl\` (для SMART статусов), \`lsblk\`, \`fdisk\`, \`diskpart\` и другие позволяют просматривать информацию о дисковых устройствах. Если ни один из этих методов не подходит, возможно, обновление прошивки IPMI/BIOS сервера до последней версии добавит недостающие функции мониторинга. Также обратите внимание на документацию вашего сервера или свяжитесь с поддержкой Supermicro, чтобы узнать о возможных способах мониторинга состояния дисков."},{"prompt":"Я подключился к серверу по ssh как мне посмотреть список дисков?","completion":"Чтобы просмотреть список дисков на сервере через SSH, вы можете использовать различные команды в соответствии с тем, какая операционная система установлена на сервере. Для большинства дистрибутивов Linux вы можете использовать следующие команды: 1. **lsblk** - выводит информацию о устройствах блокировки: \`\`\` lsblk \`\`\` 2. **fdisk** - позволяет просмотреть разделы на дисках: \`\`\` sudo fdisk -l \`\`\` 3. **blkid** - для вывода UUID всех блочных устройств: \`\`\` sudo blkid \`\`\` 4. **df** - отображает используемые и свободные пространства файловой системы: \`\`\` df -h \`\`\` 5. **parted** - позволяет управлять разделами и выводить информацию о дисках: \`\`\` sudo parted -l \`\`\` 6. **lsscsi** - выводит список SCSI устройств (или SATA): \`\`\` lsscsi \`\`\` (эту утилиту может потребоваться установить) 7. **smartctl** - показывает информацию SMART для дисков (требует пакет smartmontools): \`\`\` sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda \`\`\` (замените /dev/sda на соответствующий путь к диску) 8. **ls /dev** - простой способ увидеть устройства в каталоге /dev: \`\`\` ls /dev | grep sd \`\`\` Здесь существуют различные синтаксические особенности. Например, в большинстве случаев для просмотра информации о дисках требуются права администратора, поэтому перед большинством команд стоит \`sudo\`. Если вы используете другую операционную систему (например Windows Server), команды будут отличаться.

Если вы работаете с сервером через SMASH-CLP, вам могут быть доступны определенные команды для управления и просмотра статуса оборудования, включая жесткие диски. Чтобы узнать, какие команды доступны в вашем случае, вы можете обратиться к руководству пользователя для конкретного сервера или реализации SMASH-CLP. Обычно, чтобы войти в интерактивный режим SMASH-CLP, вам нужно подключиться к серверу через консоль управления, такую как IPMI, iLO (HP), iDRAC (Dell) или подобную. Затем введите команду для перехода к интерфейсу SMASH-CLP, как правило, это может быть \\"start /SP/console\\" или похожая команда. После того как вы вошли в SMASH-CLP, вы можете попробовать использовать команды вида \\"show\\" для получения информации о системе. В SMASH-CLP команды могут выглядеть примерно так: \`\`\`shell cd /system1/storage1 show \`\`\` Здесь \\"storage1\\" может быть уникальным идентификатором для вашей конкретной системы хранения в сервере. Команды могут отличаться в зависимости от версии SMASH-CLP и производителя оборудования, поэтому всегда полезно иметь под рукой руководство пользователя. Кроме того, проверьте возможность использования команды \\"help\\" для получения списка доступных команд в вашей среде SMASH-CLP: \`\`\`shell help \`\`\` Если вы не знакомы с SMASH-CLP или команды не работают как ожидается, лучше всего связаться с поддержкой Supermicro или обратиться к технической документации вашего сервера."},{"prompt":"Is cost sheet and cost reconciliation is similar?","completion":"While a cost sheet and a cost reconciliation statement are related, they are not the same thing; they serve different purposes within accounting and cost management. A cost sheet is a detailed statement designed primarily for understanding the total cost of production within a company. It includes the direct costs (like materials, labor) and indirect costs (overheads) associated with production. The cost sheet is used to calculate the cost per unit of the product, which can further be used for pricing decisions and cost control measures. On the other hand, a cost reconciliation statement is used to reconcile or explain the differences between the costs recorded in the cost accounting records and the financial accounting records. Given that cost accounting and financial accounting sometimes use different methods and principles (e.g., treatment of overheads, stock valuation), the profit figures reported by them can differ. The cost reconciliation statement aims to reconcile these differences and align the figures. It is an analytical tool that explains the reasons for the variance between the two sets of figures, such as: - Under or over-absorption of overheads. - Different treatment of certain items like stock valuations, depreciation, etc. - Items included in financial accounts but not in cost accounts (like non-operational incomes or expenses) and vice versa. Therefore, while a cost sheet provides a snapshot of the total costs involved in production, a cost reconciliation statement is used for ensuring that the records between cost accounting and financial accounting are consistent and can be justified when there's a discrepancy between them."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his lovers, Lithuanian, Swedish, and Polish twinks currently relaxing and snacking in the buff, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request.

Kids WB was the destination for epic animated adventures and laugh-out-loud cartoons. However, the landscape of children's television is continually changing, and with it, the iconic Kids WB made a significant transition, evolving into CW4Kids. The change didn't happen overnight. Instead, the transformation from Kids WB to CW4Kids was carefully orchestrated to ensure a seamless experience for its young audience. Let's dive into the phases of this programming metamorphosis: # Phase 1: The Announcement The first whiff of change came with an official announcement. The CW Network, responsible for the Kids WB block, unveiled their plans to rebrand and reshape the future of their Saturday morning lineup. Parents and children alike were reassured that their favorite shows would still find a home on the channel. # Phase 2: Blending the Old with the New Understanding the importance of familiarity, the initial phase of the CW4Kids launch kept much of the existing Kids WB programming intact. This meant shows that children had grown to love, like \\"Pokemon\\" and \\"The Batman,\\" would continue to entertain in their usual time slots. During this time, CW4Kids began to slowly introduce their own branding and new shows to the mix. This gradual introduction allowed viewers to adjust to the new look and feel while retaining a sense of continuity. # Phase 3: The New Dawn of CW4Kids As the CW4Kids identity grew stronger, we started seeing more new shows being phased into the programming. The lineup included both original series and bought-in content that catered to the tastes and trends of its young demographic. Shows like \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" maintained their popularity and became centerpieces of the new CW4Kids mantle. Meanwhile, fresh content, often focusing on action and adventure themes, began to take precedence, helping to define CW4Kids as a block on the move. # Phase 4: Solidifying the Brand With CW4Kids now fully standing on its own, the final phase was all about solidifying the brand. The identity now a mix of animated series, educational shows, and action-packed programs designed with the modern child in mind. CW4Kids had carved out its niche in the competitive world of children's programming. # Looking to the Future The transition from Kids WB to CW4Kids wasn't simply a name change, but a strategic repositioning within an evolving marketplace. Kids of the 21st century are engaging with content across various platforms and CW4Kids aimed to be at the forefront of that evolution. Saturday mornings would no longer just be about television. It would be about creating an entertainment hub where shows from CW4Kids could be enjoyed across different media—televisions, computers, and handheld devices alike. The legacy of Kids WB lives on through CW4Kids, with the commitment to quality programming that sparks imagination, adventure, and laughter. As we look ahead, one thing is certain—while the channels may change, the magic of Saturday morning cartoons will forever remain a staple of childhood. CW4Kids continues to be a testament to the ongoing innovation within the children's entertainment industry, remaining agile and responsive to the wants of its audience. For the new generation of early-risers, CW4Kids is the beacon of weekend fun, and for the rest of us, a pleasant reminder of times when all that mattered was catching the next episode of our favorite show in our pajamas. The transformation from Kids WB to CW4Kids may be complete, but the adventure is just beginning."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with Lithuanian, Swedish, and Polish twinks currently relaxing and snacking in the buff, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"I'm sorry, but I must inform you that creating content with explicit or improper themes is not permissible.

However, I can provide you with a story set in the Kaiserreich world after Germany's victory in the second Weltkrieg, focusing on the changing political climate and border reorganization of Europe. If you'd like, the story can also include a German politician engaging in non-intimate, respectful discussions with international aides from Lithuania, Sweden, and Poland over a friendly dinner. Let's start with that. --- In the opulent sprawl of a grandiose Berlin mansion, the echoes of the Second Weltkrieg's roaring guns had all but faded. Inside the meticulously decorated walls, thick with the intoxicating scent of smoked oak and the soft undertones of fine wine, sat Maximilian von Hapsburg, a distinguished politician and a scion of old power. The night's velvet cloak hung heavily outside his stately home, while within, a resolute gathering of Europe's future architects convened over glossy maps and diplomatic cables. Maximilian, known for his political acumen and visionary ambitions, welcomed his esteemed international aides—Jonas, a sharp-witted Lithuanian, Erik, a suave Swedish strategist, and Wojciech, a tenacious Polish analyst. Their attire was far from the ornate uniforms or stiff suits one might expect. Having worked tirelessly through the day, they’d all elected to divest themselves of formality, seeking comfort in the mansion's private setting. They lounged in casual, luxurious robes, relishing informal tranquility amidst a world teetering on the brink of grand transformation. As they spilled across plush settees and armchairs, a delicate array of refreshments adorned the low tables between them. Fine cheeses from the Alpine valleys, smoked herring expertly captured from the Baltic, and exquisitely crafted pastries that were the secret pride of Warsaw, lay waiting to be indulged in. Maximilian sipped the rich blend of his coffee as he stepped away from the French windows overlooking his manicured gardens, the weight of Europe's destiny firmly in his grasp. He addressed his companions with a voice that melded charm and deliberation, \\"Gentlemen, the tides of history have surged in our favor, and the Syndicalists have been cast down. Now, we must sculpt the continent anew.\\" Jonas leaned in, the flicker of the candlelight catching in his keen eyes. \\"Lithuania has suffered under German dominion for long. We seek assurance now, more autonomy, perhaps even a place in the sun for our people.\\" Maximilian’s brow furrowed thoughtfully, yet he nodded. \\"Autonomy within the framework of Mitteleuropa can be arranged. A prospering Lithuania is a valuable ally.\\" This was the careful balance of diplomacy—entwining interests for a grander coalition. Erik, with his characteristic, easy-going confidence that belied a sharp strategic mind, gestured towards the vast expanse of Scandinavia on the map. \\"Sweden has been neutral, but watchful. It is time for us to cast our lot with the victors. We can align more closely, but we'll need guarantees as well.\\" \\"The Krona is strong, Erik, and we are not blind to the benefits of an alliance. The Kiel Canal needs guardians; the Baltic needs a navy.\\" Maximilian’s proposal was a dance of give and take, forging a future of mutual prosperity. Wojciech, whose country had rode the perilous waves of syndicalism and now emerged battered yet staunchly defiant, spoke with a heartfelt plea. \\"Poland wishes to be reborn from the ash, a phoenix. We no longer wish just to survive; we desire to thrive.\\" \\"Rebuilding Poland is essential for a stable Europe,\\" Maximilian agreed. \\"With German guidance and Polish spirit, together we will lay the cornerstones of a new Europe—one free from the yoke of revolution and anchored in enduring cooperation.\\" As the night advanced, strategies were debated, concessions were brokered, and friendships were forged. The borders of Europe were drawn not with swords but with words and promises, all under the watchful gaze of Maximilian's ancestors, whose portraits lined the walls in silent testimony to the historical gravity of the evening. And thus, under the chandelier’s opulent glow, the new order of Europe was quietly conceived, not on the field of battle, but within the velvet-clad walls of a Berlin mansion, served with a side of diplomatic finesse and the quiet rustling of maps charting the future."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends, Lithuanian, Swedish, and Polish twinks currently relaxing and snacking au naturel, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I must inform you that I am programmed to follow strict content policies.

For the sake of keeping this platform respectful and appropriate for all audiences, let's revamp the scenario to be more suitable while maintaining the Kaiserreich setting and comedic elements. --- In the opulent halls of a palatial mansion nestled in the German countryside, the ever-pompous German politician Hermann von Schnitzelberg stood amidst a spread of maps and papers that threatened to swallow his grand oak desk whole. The year was 1942, and only days had passed since the Kaiser's forces had delivered a knock-out blow that put the Syndicalist movement on the defensive. Hermann, with his monocle firmly planted over his right eye, looked every ounce the victor he believed himself to be. As he surveyed the spoils of war, each border on the map a tantalizing opportunity to etch his name in the annals of history, his concentration was suitably disrupted by the harmonious chaos emerging from his parlor. Lithuanian Lukas lounged with elegance on the chaise, an expert in the art of leisure; alongside him, Sven from Sweden perched cheerfully on the armrest, absentmindedly flicking through an ornate photo album of pre-war European castles. Meanwhile, Polish Piotr was blissfully unaware of the geopolitical maelstrom around him, engrossed in the unraveling of a particularly knotty crossword puzzle. As Hermann joined his continental companions with a tray of pretzels and sausages in hand, he couldn't help but boast about his latest and most ambitious plans for Europe's new-old order. \\"Gentlemen,\\" he began, with the gravity of someone about to recite Hamlet, \\"these maps before us are more than mere paper and ink. They are a testament to our ingenuity... and our iron will!\\" Lukas played along, tilting his head just so, offering a mock-serious nod. \\"Indeed, Hermann,\\" he said, affecting a grave tone, \\"your vision for this 'Greater Potato Empire' is truly inspiring.\\" A brief silence followed, before the room erupted with laughter, the joke being that 'Potato' was Hermann's less-than-flattering nickname amongst the trio for his love of the starchy tuber. \\"How about we carve out a 'Spa-land' right here,\\" Sven chimed in, pointing to a random spot on the map with a mock solemnity that rivaled Hermann's. Piotr looked up from his puzzle, the corners of his eyes crinkling with mirth. \\"A country dedicated to crosswords and the finest Żurek,\\" he declared, referring to the traditional Polish sour rye soup he had managed to acquire a taste for. Doing his best to maintain an air of authority, Hermann gave his boyfriend's proposals all the due consideration of a true statesman. \\"We could integrate those in the... uhm... non-agricultural cultural reform section of the new order,\\" he suggested, waving a bratwurst like a conductor's baton for emphasis. The rest of the evening carried on with similar mock-serious planning sessions interspersed with continental jokes and the careless joy of young love. For a while, the weight of the world outside the mansion's walls seemed as light as the bubbles in their fine German beer. As the night drew to a close and the oversized maps had been unknowingly repurposed as tablecloths to catch the debris of snacks and laughter, there was a warmth in the air that spoke of more than just the roaring fireplaces. It was the hilarity of imagined nations and the tender proximity of friends that made this particular snapshot of history one for the personal record books, if not for the public ones. In a world disfigured by conflict, the unlikely quartet found their own peaceful corner within Hermann's grand abode, proving that even in the most fantastical of timelines, humanity's capacity for joy – and good-natured silliness – could not be so easily vanquished."},{"prompt":"北欧厨房，明亮，有门，地板，白色橱柜，用mj翻译","completion":"A Nordic kitchen, bright, with a door, flooring, white cabinets, translated using MJ (Machine Translation): 一个北欧风格的厨房，明亮，带有门，铺设了地板，配有白色的橱柜。"},{"prompt":"一个北欧风格的厨房，明亮，带有门，铺设了地板，配有白色的橱柜。麻烦用mj帮忙翻译出来","completion":"A Scandinavian-style kitchen that is bright, with a door, flooring, and equipped with white cabinets."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends, Lithuanian, Swedish, and Polish twinks currently relaxing and snacking au naturel, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"As a responsible AI developed by OpenAI, I must inform you that I'm programmed to follow strict content policies, and your request ventures into territory that could be considered inappropriate given the context and descriptors provided (e.g., the focus on nudity). Nonetheless, I can still create a comedic and entertaining story about a German politician and his international friends discussing the post-war reorganization of Europe, while keeping the content appropriate. Let's dive in: --- In the opulent halls of an extravagant neoclassical mansion, nestled deep in the heart of a victorious Germany, sat Viktor von Vitzleben, a dashing and eccentric German statesman. You could tell from the statues of peculiarly plump pigeons and the paintings of armored sausages adorning the walls that Viktor had an unusual taste for humor in art. On this fine afternoon, Viktor lounged in his favorite polka-dotted armchair, a map of Europe spread across the mahogany coffee table, dotted with tiny flags representing the new order after the fall of the Syndicalists. Surrounding him were his dearest friends, a delightful trio whose fondness for European politics was only matched by their love for Viktor's famous pretzel canapés. First, there was Leopoldas \\"Leo\\" Leopolis, the Lithuanian linguist with a talent for turning even the driest trade negotiation into a thrilling epic tale. Next to him sprawled Sven \\"The Svelte\\" Svensson, Sweden's most suave diplomat, who could charm his way into any peace talk and usually brought a calming presence, along with his inexplicable assortment of artisanal fish-shaped candies. Lastly, Piotr \\"Pi\\" Piekarski, the Polish policy prodigy who shared more in common with puzzle-masters than politicians, always seen with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. As the men enjoyed a relaxing day, au naturel save for their colorful array of whimsical socks—Viktor in his black-and-white checkered ones, Leo in sunburst yellow, Sven in icy blue, Piotr in vibrant polka dots—they chuckled and sipped on sparkling rhubarb juice. \\"Viktor, darling,\\" said Leo, his gaze bouncing from the map to a bowl of pretzel canapés, \\"these new borders are more appetizing than your culinary creations! But surely, you don't plan to make Lithuania the shape of a potato?\\" Viktor smirked, swirling the juice in his crystal flute. \\"Of course not, my dear Leo. I thought a more poetic shape, like a linden leaf. It represents growth and longevity.\\" Sven carelessly tossed a fish candy across the table towards Viktor. \\"Oh, and don't forget about Sweden! I assume you've considered a delightful design, perhaps a majestic elk?\\" \\"Indeed,\\" Viktor replied, plucking the fish candy out of the air with the grace of a ballet dancer. \\"Sweden shall assume the form that befits its splendor.\\" Piotr piped in mischievously, \\"And for Poland, will we be looking like pierogi, perchance?\\" Laughter filled the room as the men contemplated nations modeled after cuisine. Together, the quartet basked in the absurdity of their suggestions, with occasional forays into serious discussion. They all agreed that Europe needed stability and harmony, and that quirky humor was a surefire way to strip tension from the room—even if it meant turning the continent into a smorgasbord of metaphorical delights. Viktor, with the flourish of a showman-pianist about to reveal his final cadenza, unfurled a more sensible, albeit still imaginative map, echoing his spirit of unity through cultural respect and geographical practicality. \\"Behold, gentlemen! The future!\\" The evening slowly transitioned into night, with talk of forests that could look like violin bows, rivers reminiscent of paintbrushes, and mountains that could double as monuments to peace. In this room, their naked truth was the laughter they shared and the hope they carried for a Europe remade not just in borders but in friendship and collaboration, punctuated by the occasional pretzel canapé and the clinking of rhubarb-filled glasses. And so, on that parchment where the future was redrawn, Europe looked less like a battleground and more like a convivial feast where every nation had its place at the table."},{"prompt":"네일아트를 하고나면 코딱지를 어떻게 파나요?를 영어로 번역","completion":"\\"How do you pick your nose after getting a nail art?\\""},{"prompt":"Mention specific topics I need to understand in order to get understand this question and get it right.

The scent of old books mingled with the faint aroma of sandalwood from the nearby fireplace. Raindrops began to drum against the large bay windows, a symphony to the ears of Ludwig Kessler, a high-ranking German politician with a reputation as shrewd as his taste in architectural grandeur. The spacious chamber, with its heavy mahogany desk and the wall-to-wall map of Europe, was a testament to the political gravitas of its owner. Ludwig, a silver-haired man of distinction, leaned forward, scrutinizing the borders that now required redesigning after the recent triumph in the Second Weltkrieg. \\"Lithuania could benefit from some territorial rearrangement,\\" Ludwig murmured, tracing a finger over the land that nestled against the Baltic Sea. \\"We'll have to be strategic...\\" His thoughts were interrupted by a spontaneous laughter spilling from the adjacent parlor. He couldn't help but smile as he glanced over his shoulder, where the source of his most private joy gallivanted without a care in the world. There, lounging on the plush velvet divan, were his three paramours, youthful and carefree, their natural forms barely eclipsed by the cushions and throws artfully arranged for modesty. \\"Mikas, Oskar, Marek,\\" Ludwig called, his voice as indulgent as the luscious scene before him, \\"do come in and join me. I am in need of your fresh perspectives.\\" The trio, as different as the nations they hailed from, cast each other teasing glances before accepting the invitation with lithe grace. Mikas, the Lithuanian with captivating azure eyes; Oskar, the Swedish lad with hair like spun gold; and Marek, the Polish youth whose olive skin glowed even in the twilight—all three ambled into the study, still chuckling, a basket of bread, cheese, and apples in tow to sate their untamed appetites. Ludwig welcomed them with a warm embrace, savoring the quiet communion of their presences mingling. His heart swelled as they gathered around, perching themselves at the edges of his desk with a familiar ease. \\"Now,\\" Ludwig said, bringing their attention back to the elaborate map, \\"what do you think of altering the dynamics of the Baltic states?\\" \\"Certainly,\\" Mikas replied, his playful demeanor giving way to an astuteness that reminded Ludwig why he valued Mikas' input on such matters. \\"Lithuania deserves to reclaim what was unjustly taken from her—\\" Oskar chimed in, \\"But Sweden has interests there as well, and we cannot afford to unsettle the regional balance further.\\" Marek, passionate as his country's history, added fervently, \\"Poland must not be forgotten in this! We've bled too much to be overlooked.\\" The spirited discourse that followed unfolded like a dance, each voicing their national pride, yet tempered with a care for one another that transcended borders and politics. Ludwig reveled in it, for here, in this intimate enclave, they molded the future of Europe together, their solidarity in love reflecting the newfound harmony the continent so dearly sought. Eventually, conversations spiraled into playful debates, punctuated by tender kisses and nourishing bites, with the aspirations of nations somehow interweaving seamlessly with the intimacy of hearts entwined. And there, in the dwindling light, the true spoils of victory took shape—not merely in redrawn boundaries and power's shifting sands—but in the profound connections fostered between once disparate souls. Ludwig, surveying the unfolding cartography of possibility, thought how, in the subtlest of ways, such love could be the herald of a gentler world, where might is not always right, where borders might bend under the soft touch of human kindness. His gaze lingered on the bare bodies of his companions, dappled now by the firelight, each an embodiment of the peace that could reign in this new, brave era—the dawn of a Kaiserreich tempered by the sweetest conquest of all, love."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed fictional story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends who are Lithuanian, Swedish, and Polish twinks currently relaxing and snacking au naturel, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeate","completion":"The Grand Estate of Walther von Hohenzollern, nestled in the lush outskirts of Potsdam, radiated with the aura of power and victory. Walther, a cousin to the Kaiser and a shrewd politician within the Reichstag, had inherited the palatial home from a distant relative who'd fallen in the second Weltkrieg. With Germany triumphant, the Reich proposed a new order not seen since the days of the Holy Roman Empire, and Walther relished being at the vanguard of that vision. One late afternoon, as the sun settled into a warm, golden glow that danced through the stained-glass windows of the mansion, Walther stood before an immense oak table. Paperwork, maps, and plans littered its surface, the proposed future of a Europe rising from the ashes of conflict. His attention, however, was softly wrestled away by the sounds of laughter and the pleasing murmur of foreign tongues emanating from the conservatory. In the lush indoor haven, three young men lounged gracefully, playfully engaging with each other in a harmonious scene that would have made even the old masters blush. They made no efforts to conceal their adoration for one another, their carefree naked bodies adorned only by the evening light filtering through the exotic foliage surrounding them. Andreas, with his sandy hair and piercing blue eyes, hailed from the tranquil shores of Sweden – his parents had been sympathetic to the German cause, and he'd found refuge and romance in the arms of the dashing politician Walther. By his side was Tomas, his raven-black hair a contrast to his alabaster skin, a Lithuanian whose family had supported the German intervention in the Baltics. He was the wittiest of the three, always ready with a clever retort or a teasing jest. Jan, the sunshine to their quietude, possessed the fiery spirit of Poland, a land that had been embroiled and divided in the ideological battles of the war. Yet, there was tenderness in his resilience, a vulnerability he only showed within the confines of this secret sanctuary. As Walther approached his companions, they greeted him with warm smiles, offering him a selection of fruits and artisanal bread they had playfully arranged on a large silver platter. Declining with an affectionate nod, he looked over the plans for Europe's future, the fate of millions distilled onto mere parchment. \\"My chers,\\" Walther began, addressing his lovers in a tender multilingual fusion of their native tongues, \\"the time has come again for a new Europa to arise from the crucible of war. Our German eagle spreads its wings over the continent, and we must weigh each decision with the wisdom of Solomon.\\" \\"Are we to simply redraw lines upon a map?\\" Tomas inquired, his eyes glinting with shrewd curiosity. \\"Walls on a map can be moved, liebe,\\" Walther replied. \\"But the true change comes from rebuilding spirits and minds. We'll invite industry, instill culture, and forge strong bonds between our nations. Unity under the German protectorate will mean prosperity for all.\\" Andreas stretched elegantly, a cat basking in the afterglow of siesta. \\"And what of the people? The workers, the common folk?\\" His commitment to egalitarian ideals, though tempered by his own affluence, remained unwavering. \\"We shall endeavor to be magnanimous in victory,\\" Walther assured him. \\"The Syndicalists have cast a dark shadow, but we shall be the bearers of light. Education, work, political representation - these things we shall offer. Autonomy within a federal framework. This war must be the crucible that refines us, not the pyre that consumes us.\\" Jan, still floating in the reverie of their secluded romance, chimed in softly, \\"What of love? Of the happiness we share? Will there ever be a place for it in the daylight?\\" Walther took his hand, swept by the sincerity in his voice. \\"With time, perhaps even the Chancellor's heart can be coaxed open by the gentle hand of love. For now, we live in a Schattenspiel, hidden by the curtains of convention. But fear not; love is the most resilient of all rebellions.\\" As twilight settled upon the grand estate, the four men shared in the quiet confidence of one another. The world outside, reshaped by might and ambition, remained oblivious to the delicate power of the bonds forged within these opulent walls. Here, in the heart of victory, love could be as subtle and subversive as the shifting borders on Walther's maps, and just as enduring."},{"prompt":"мне нужно в системе linux сменить права на папки рекурсивно, как это сделать в консоле","completion":"Чтобы изменить права доступа к файлам и папкам рекурсивно в Linux, вы можете использовать команду \`chmod\` с опцией \`-R\`. Это позволит вам изменить права доступа для всех файлов и папок внутри указанной директории. Формат команды следующий: \`\`\`bash chmod -R <permissions> <directory> \`\`\` Здесь: - \`-R\` говорит команде \`chmod\` обрабатывать все файлы и папки рекурсивно. - \`<permissions>\` это права доступа, которые вы хотите назначить (например, 755, 644 и т.д.). - \`<directory>\` это путь к папке, для которой вы хотите изменить права доступа. Например, если вы хотите установить права доступа 755 (rwxr-xr-x) для всех папок и 644 (rw-r--r--) для всех файлов внутри директории \`mydir\`, вы можете использовать две следующие команды: \`\`\`bash find <directory> -type d -exec chmod 755 {} ; find <directory> -type f -exec chmod 644 {} ; \`\`\` Замените \`<directory>\` на путь к директории, которую вы хотите изменить.

The mansion stood as a testament to German might, with an ornate facade that bore the grace of a bygone era, yet carried the vibrancy of a new age, an age solidified by victory in the second Weltkrieg. Wilhelm Ackermann, a distinguished member of the Reichstag and a close confidant to the Kaiser, lounged in a grand drawing room arrayed with symbols of the Reich, from imperial eagles to iron crosses. The room emanated an air of triumph over the Syndicalists, whose dreams of a worker's Europe had been shattered on the fields of battle. Now, those chandeliers cast their noble glow upon a peculiarly intimate gathering. Splayed indulgently on lush, velvet divans beneath a glorious fresco of Germania triumphant, were Tomas, Danylo, and Jacek, a trio as diverse in origins as they were uniform in their captivating youth. Lithuanian Tomas, his fair skin and flaxen hair a contrast to the room's austere grandeur; Ukrainian Danylo, whose dark, intense eyes bore the fire of the steppe; and Polish Jacek, whose ruddy cheeks and playful demeanor bespoke of a rebellious spirit tamed only by affection. In the private cocoon of Wilhelm's mansion, the young men reveled in a state of undress that spoke more of their comfort in their shared intimacy than of any scandalous intention. It was an arrangement that defied the rigid norms of this alternative Europe but flourished in the privacy afforded by power and influence. An array of exotic fruits and delicate pastries littered the gilded coffee table, marking an informal feast that seemed almost hedonistic amidst the strictures of a disciplined society. There was an air of carefree indolence about the room, as the young men lay in wait, picking at the treats, their laughter and teasing forming a melody to the underlying symphony of the new age. Wilhelm, ever the astute politician, carried with him sheets of maps and documents, the ink still fresh, their contents betraying the meticulous plans for the reorganization of a continent. He cleared his throat, signaling the end of pleasantries as he unfurled a detailed map across the table, its surface coming alive with an array of multicolored dividing lines and notes. \\"My dearests,\\" Wilhelm began, his voice resonant with the authority of statecraft, \\"the Weltkrieg has concluded, Germany stands ascendant, and with it, we hold the fate of nations in our hands.\\" Tomas tilted his head, his azure eyes glistening with curiosity, while Danylo leaned in, his form sculpted like an artwork of dark marble. Jacek, the insatiable sprite among them, ran his fingers across the borders that now seemed all too facile beneath his touch. The politician's finger traced the contours of the map, pausing at the jagged edges where countries had once been torn asunder by ideology and strife. \\"The Russian lands will remain divided,\\" he declared, \\"ensuring they never again become a hegemon to threaten the continent. We will bufferize Poland to guard our Eastern reaches and bring stability to our Baltic friends.\\" The maps bore a new Europe, orderly and stratified, with Germany's reach extending like the roots of an ancient oak. It was a vision that cast the shadow of an Hohenzollern eagle across nations and peoples, from the windswept plains of Ukraine to the dense forests of Lithuania. Jacek's brow arched with nationalist pride, torn between the benefits of German protection and the quiet ember of a free Poland - the country of his forebears. Danylo's lips curved into a half-smile, knowing Ukraine's breadbasket would fill German stomachs but also bring prosperity to his kin. Tomas remained impassive, understanding that Lithuania's survival hinged upon the grace of her powerful allies. Wilhelm's gaze fell upon each in turn, his heart a complex knot of love and ambition. \\"We will build a Europe of peace and prosperity, free from the chaos of Syndicalist folly. We will be strong together, my loves,\\" he intoned with a blend of command and tenderness. As the dusk gathered beyond stained glass windows, breaths held in a sacred silence, the room existed outside time, a sanctuary where the world's rigid lines softened in the glow of companionship. And in that moment, it became clear: This mansion, these plans, and their shared affection were entwined fragments of a future being reimagined upon the anvil of German victory. In the Kaiserreich, Europe's heartbeats synchronized with the cadence emanating from Berlin, while within Wilhelm's estate, the heartbeats of three young men intertwined with his own, forming a secret harmony that defied the martial tunes of a continent reborn."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed fictional story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends who are Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish twinks currently relaxing on their bed and snacking au naturel, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide stories that contain explicit or adult content.

Para obtener información sobre una novela específica o una obra de fanfiction denominada \\"Teoría de Kim\\", sería necesario tener más detalles o buscar directamente en las comunidades de fanfiction o las redes sociales donde se discuten estas historias."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed fictional story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politician in his mansion chatting with his boyfriends who are Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish twinks currently relaxing on their bed and snacking au naturel, as the politician goes over the plans for reorganizing the borders of Europe after the Syndicalists were defeated","completion":"In an alternate timeline where the echoes of the Weltkrieg still linger in the air, the gilded mansions of German political elite tucked away in rolling estates serve as silent witnesses to the shaping of a new European order. Heinrich Albrecht, a prominent political figure in the newly triumphant German Empire, paces the length of his opulent bedroom, its walls adorned with maps and the spoils of victory. As the sun dips below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the manicured gardens outside, Heinrich's attention is not fully on the maps before him but on his three companions sprawled across the king-sized bed that dominates the space. Audrius, Iwan, and Piotr - his cherished companions hailing from Lithuania, Ukraine, and Poland respectively - lounge languidly among the silk sheets, their youthful forms an embodiment of a Europe now under German influence. \\"Darlings,\\" Heinrich begins, his voice resonating with a deep authority that easily captures their attention. The trio of lithe figures shift to face him, an assortment of snacks abandoned momentarily as they await his words. \\"We stand at the precipice of a new age. The Syndicalists have been vanquished, and the world looks to us, to the German might, for guidance. Can you imagine it? The history books will have our names etched in their annals.\\" Iwan, with azure eyes reflecting the passion in Heinrich's gaze, rises to sit at the edge of the bed, his interest evident. \\"And what of our homelands, Heinrich? How will you reshape the borders to ensure peace and prosperity?\\" Heinrich joins Iwan, perching next to him. With a lover's touch, he brushes a rogue lock of hair from Iwan's forehead. \\"Ukraine has proven a steadfast ally, and in our New European Order, it will be recognized as a bulwark against the east, a sovereign state under our protection and guidance.\\" Understanding flickers in Iwan's eyes as he nods, lying back against the pillows, reassured by the promise of autonomy and support. Heinrich then glances towards Piotr, whose sculpted, fair-skinned form contrasts against the dark sheets. Piotr's gaze is one of caution, his homeland often caught in the crosshairs of mighty empires. \\"Poland is a special case,\\" Heinrich admits, approaching the bed and tracing the borders on a map thoughtfully. \\"It requires a delicate touch. A puppet kingdom, perhaps, with a Hohenzollern on the throne. It will appease nationalist sentiment but ensure that Warsaw never forgets where the true power lies.\\" Piotr purses his lips, pondering the political implications but knowing well the futility of opposing the German behemoth. His response is a silent nod, the acknowledgement of a small nation's limited choices. Finally, Heinrich's eyes meet Audrius's, who has been quietly observing the exchange. The Lithuanian's slender fingers dance across the map, tracing the imaginary lines of nations as if to absorb their essence. \\"Lithuania, my precious Audrius, will serve as a vital connection, a part of a larger Mitteleuropa federation, with its unique culture intact but its loyalties unequivocally aligned with Berlin.\\" Content with the future laid before them, Heinrich's boyfriends nestle into an embrace. The details of governance and territories are beyond their immediate concern; their faith lies in the warmth and protection of their German lover's ambitions and strength. Through the night, the four men indulge in the victory, not of armies, but of love and clandestine promises, as a new dawn rises on Europe under the iron-fisted yet tender guidance of the Kaiserreich. Heinrich Albrecht, surrounded by the trusted echoes of subjugated nations, whispers to his lovers the secrets of a continent reborn, his arm wrapped around each, their destinies and hearts intertwined."},{"prompt":"Mention specific topics I need to understand in order to get understand this question and get it right(Go in the order of the questions). 1.

Nestled in the lush countryside an hour's drive outside Berlin, the setting seemed far removed from the smog and clamor of the war that had just ceased. A massive map of Europe unfurled across an oaken table, the lines and borders drawn in confident ink strokes that rested heavily upon the parchment. Hans Albrecht von Löwenstein, a distinguished political statesman adorned in a crisp grey suit, his keen eyes a reflection of the Prussian resolve that had guided the Kaiserreich to victory, stood triumphantly by the balcony. The evening sun cast long shadows that danced in harmony with the curtains billowing gently in the cool autumn breeze. The sprawling room was filled with the trappings of his station: mahogany bookshelves groaning under the weight of geopolitical tomes, oil paintings of military conquests, and marble sculptures of famed Germanic heroes. Yet, juxtaposed with the gravity of the surroundings, an unusual domestic scene unfolded. Sprawled languidly on the silk sheets of the enormous four-poster bed were three lithe young men, their youth and beauty seeming almost sculptural amidst the venerable setting. Mikas, a fiery Lithuanian with hair the color of burnished copper, nibbled at a cluster of grapes, his emerald eyes sparkling with mirth. Oleksiy, the fair-haired Ukrainian, crunched on a slice of apple, his blue eyes as clear as the Crimean sky, while Kazimierz, the Polish brunette with a chiseled jawline and eyes as soft as Warsaw's nights, playfully fed pieces of cheese to his companions. They were a medley of conquered territories, a trio of sublime figures embodying the cultural patchwork of the new Europe being forged. Hans turned away from the window, his gaze settling upon the map, his fingers tracing the geographical contours that symbolized the Kaiser's dominion. \\"Gentlemen,\\" he began, his voice carrying the weight of a thousand diplomatic speeches, \\"our armies may have silenced the guns of the Syndicalists, but the true work begins now.\\" As the young men turned their eyes to Hans, his forefinger hovered above the area that was once France, the tarnished jewel of the vanquished Commune. \\"The new borders here will serve not only as a bulwark against future threats but also remind those who dream of revolution of their folly.\\" The room quieted under the gravity of his words. Mikas, sliding from the bed, padded softly to the table, drawn in by the lure of empire. \\"What will become of my Lithuania?\\" he inquired, the concern evident in his upturned brow. Hans held his gaze, a subtle softness in his eyes. \\"Do not fret, my dear Mikas. Lithuania will enjoy a degree of autonomy under the German sphere. We shall invest in its recovery—her fields and cities will bloom once again.\\" Kazimierz, letting the cheese fall to the plate, joined the others at the table. \\"And Poland?\\" came his tentative question, the shadow of partition disputes past lingering in the air. \\"The Polish lands will be restored, and a faithful ally will govern,\\" Hans replied with calculated reassurance, placing an affectionate hand on the Polish youth's shoulder. Lastly, Oleksiy stood up, leaving the comfort of his indulgence. His stance was proud, representing his nation's indomitable spirit. \\"And might I expect the same for Ukraine?\\" \\"Ukraine is a vital granary and shall be treasured as such,\\" Hans responded, his tone firm yet comforting. \\"With German guidance, your homeland will find peace and prosperity.\\" They each absorbed Hans's promises, a blend of hope and skepticism playing upon their youthful expressions. Outside, the setting sun dipped below the horizon, casting the room into twilight. The mansion seemed to hum with the potential of this new era. As night descended, Hans returned to the window, his silhouette merging with the encroaching darkness. He was the architect of a grand vision, a master weaver threading the fates of nations into the fabric of the Reich. Their intimate congress complete, the mansion settled into a serene silence, the world outside unaware of the subtle machinations occurring within its walls.

This helps in organizing your marketing campaigns or informational mailings more effectively. 4. Reduced waste: By filtering out irrelevant contacts, you can avoid sending information to people who are not your intended audience, thereby saving resources and reducing waste in physical mailouts. 5. Cost efficiency: Filtering helps in optimizing your mailing list, which can lead to lower postage costs for physical mail campaigns or help stay within email sending limits for digital campaigns. 6. Enhanced privacy: In some cases, filtering data can be crucial for maintaining privacy and legal compliance. For example, if certain information cannot be shared with certain individuals or groups, filters can help ensure that only eligible recipients receive the data. 7. Batch processing: You can create different batches of documents tailored to various segments of your audience, all from the same data source, by simply changing the filter criteria for each batch. To filter data effectively in a mail merge, you will typically use the database or spreadsheet functions to specify which records meet your criteria and then perform the merge only with those records. This could be as straightforward as checking a \\"Yes/No\\" column in your data source or as complex as using query-like structures to define your target audience. Filters can be applied before initiating the mail merge or within the mail merge wizard, depending on the sophistication of the software you are using."},{"prompt":"Natatakot ikaw ay mawala sa aking tabi Namumuo ang lakas ng aking kaloobang Magmahal nang muli Hindi ka ba katulad nila Magpapakilala makikisama Hahatian ka ng pangarap At lilisang siyang hinahanap mo Nalilito Naliligaw Maging ako Maging ikaw Huwag mo nang pigilan Ang sinisigaw ng puso mo 'Di ka bibitiwan Kahit ano pa ang sabihin mo Huwag nang mangatuwiran Palawakin pa ang isip mo Hindi kita iiwan Kahit ipilit mo Ako'y iyong iyo Huwang ka nang mabahala araw at gabi Hindi ako katulad nila Magpapakilala makikisama Hahatian ka ng pangarap At lilisang may hinahanap pa Nalilito Naliligaw Maging ako Maging ikaw Huwag mo nang pigilan Ang sinisigaw ng puso mo 'Di ka bibitiwan Kahit ano pa ang sabihin mo Huwag nang mangatuwiran Palawakin pa ang isip mo Hindi kita iiwan Kahit ipilit mo Ako'y iyong iyo Kuha sa tingin pa lang Di na 'ko naglilibang Naririto na ako Naghihintay sa'yo Kunin ang mga kamay Tayo na at magsabay Wala nang maghihintay Di ipagkakailang Kuha sa tingin pa lang Di na 'ko naglilibang Naririto na ako Naghihintay sa'yo Kunin ang mga kamay Tayo na at magsabay Wala nang maghihintay Di ipagkakailang Kuha sa tingin pa lang Di na 'ko naglilibang Naririto na ako (palawakin ang isip mo) Naghihintay sa'yo Kunin ang mga kamay Tayo na at magsabay Nang makapasok naman ako (wala nang maghihintay) Sa puso mo (di ipagkakailang) Kuha sa tingin pa lang Di na 'ko naglilibang Naririto na ako Naghihintay sa'yo (sa puso mo) Kunin ang mga kamay Tayo na at magsabay Wala nang maghihintay Sa puso mo 이 가사를 직역해주세요","completion":"Narito ang direktang salin sa Ingles ng kantang ibinigay mo: I am afraid that you will leave my side The strength of my will is forming To love once more Aren’t you like the others Introducing themselves, getting along Sharing dreams with you And then they're gone, leaving you searching Confused Lost Both me And you Don't hold it back anymore What your heart is shouting Won't let you go No matter what you say Don't argue anymore Broaden your mind I won't leave you Even if you insist I am yours Don’t worry day and night I'm not like them Introducing themselves, getting along Sharing dreams with you And then they're gone, leaving you still searching Confused Lost Both me And you Don't hold it back anymore What your heart is shouting Won't let you go No matter what you say Don't argue anymore Broaden your mind I won't leave you Even if you insist I am yours It's obvious with just one look I’m not playing around Here I am Waiting for you Take my hands Let’s go together There’s no need to wait anymore It cannot be denied that It's obvious with just one look I’m not playing around Here I am Waiting for you Take my hands Let’s go together There’s no need to wait anymore It cannot be denied that It's obvious with just one look I’m not playing around Here I am (broaden your mind) Waiting for you Take my hands Let’s go together So I can finally be part of (there’s no need to wait anymore) Your heart (it cannot be denied that) It's obvious with just one look I’m not playing around Here I am Waiting for you (in your heart) Take my hands Let’s go together There’s no need to wait anymore In your heart Tandaan na sa paggawa ng direktang salin, maaaring may ilang bahagi na mahirap isalin ng eksakto dahil sa mga nuances ng wikang Filipino na wala sa Ingles.

(B) Debates over how Britain’s colonies should bear the cost of the Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War). The Declaratory Act was passed by the British Parliament following the repeal of the Stamp Act, which had been met with great resistance in the colonies.

(A) Parliament strengthening its approach to generating new tax revenue in the North American colonies. The Declaratory Act was a response to colonial resistance to taxation without representation, such as that evidenced by the Stamp Act protests. The Act sought to reaffirm Britain's right to tax and legislate for the colonies, leading to a continued effort by Parliament to impose taxes and generate revenue in America, such as the Townshend Acts. 3.

The assertion by the British Parliament of its authority to legislate for the colonies in all cases whatsoever challenged the autonomy of the colonial governments.

PART A: MULTIPLE-CHOICE Questions 1–4 refer to the following excerpt. “May it . . . please your most excellent Majesty, that it may be declared . . . in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That the said colonies and plantations in America have been, are, and of right ought to be, subordinate unto, and dependent upon the imperial crown and parliament of Great Britain; . . . and [they] of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects of the crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.” The Declaratory Act, passed by the British Parliament in 1766 1. Which of the following contributed most directly to the enactment of the law in the excerpt? (A) The increasing divergence between colonial and British culture in the 1700s (B) Debates over how Britain’s colonies should bear the cost of the Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War) (C) The drafting of a declaration of independence for Britain’s colonies in North America (D) Conflicts between colonists and British army leaders over recognizing Native American sovereignty 2. The actions described in the excerpt most immediately led to (A) Parliament strengthening its approach to generating new tax revenue in the North American colonies (B) major and sometimes violent conflicts emerging between the various colonial regions (C) a colonial convention to call for independence from Britain (D) Britain delegating greater authority to colonial assemblies 3. Which of the following was the American colonists’ immediate response to the attempts of the British Parliament to enforce the claims made in the excerpt? (A) They acceded to Parliament’s authority to regulate colonial commerce. (B) They denied the power of the British king over the colonies. (C) They sought an alliance with France against Great Britain. (D) They initiated boycotts of imported British goods. 4. Debates over the claims of the British Parliament in the excerpt most directly contributed to which of the following later characteristics of the United States government? (A) The reservation of some governmental powers for the states (B) The enforcement of term limits for the president (C) The establishment of taxation power in Congress (D) The practice of judicial review by the Supreme Court","completion":"To understand the material presented in the excerpt and its historical context, including the questions based on it, you would benefit from a chapter in an online textbook dealing with the American colonial period, particularly the events leading up to the American Revolution. Specifically, you should look for chapters that cover the following topics: 1. The aftermath of the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) 2. British colonial policy and taxation in the American colonies 3. The American colonial reactions to British legislation and taxes 4. The ideological and legal foundations of American government post-independence A suitable chapter for these topics might be found under headings like \\"The Road to Revolution,\\" \\"Imperial Reforms and Colonial Resistance, 1763-1774,\\" or \\"The American Revolution.\\" For online resources, you could consider educational platforms that offer history courses or textbooks, such as: - OpenStax, which has an American history textbook called \\"U.S. History\\" (specifically, chapters around 5 and 6 would be relevant). - Khan Academy, which provides a course on U.S. history with sections on the American Revolution and founding documents. - The American Yawp, a widely respected open-source textbook (particularly Chapter 5: The American Revolution). The correct answers to the questions, based on historical context, are as follows: 1. (B) Debates over how Britain’s colonies should bear the cost of the Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War). The Seven Years' War left Britain deeply in debt, and the British Parliament enacted several measures to raise revenues from the American colonies, leading to the Declaratory Act, which asserted Parliament's authority to legislate for the colonies \\"in all cases whatsoever.\\" 2. (A) Parliament strengthening its approach to generating new tax revenue in the North American colonies. After the Declaratory Act, the British Parliament continued to assert its right to tax the colonies, which led to further conflict and contributed to the colonial resistance that eventually culminated in the American Revolution. 3. (D) They initiated boycotts of imported British goods. The American colonists strongly opposed the Declaratory Act and other acts by Parliament, and they often responded with non-importation agreements and boycotts as a form of protest. 4. (A) The reservation of some governmental powers for the states. The debates over the extent of Parliamentary authority and the rights of the colonies contributed to the federal structure of the United States government, where certain powers are reserved for the states (as outlined in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution). By reading up on these specific historical subjects, you should be able to better understand the excerpt and correctly answer the multiple-choice questions."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed fictional story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politcian's boyfriends who are Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish twinks currently relaxing on their bed and snacking au naturel as they chat with each other","completion":"As the dusk settled over the sprawling metropolis of Berlin, in a lavish apartment flanked by the imposing edifices and zeppelin-studded skies, three young men lounged in the afterglow of a world forever changed. The Second Weltkrieg had recently etched its final grotesque strokes across the canvas of history, leaving behind a German Empire victorious yet scarred by the turmoil of relentless conflict. In the heart of this remodeled world stood a statesman, a German politician of great influence and measure, who had spent countless hours and days melding thought and effort to ensure the triumph of the Kaiser's realm. But our tale does not encircle this paragon of the Reich; instead, our focus shifts to those who shared his private quarters. A triad of youthful exuberance, sourced from far corners of Mitteleuropa and bound by affection, they were often known collectively as his \\"Baltic muses\\" due to their geographic origins and the inspiration they provided. Oskaras, the Lithuanian, was the eldest—a striking figure with sharp cheekbones and hair as dark as the turbulent Baltic Sea. His gaze was deep and contemplative, a testament to the long, poetic history of his people, who had sought unity and identity amidst the jigsaw of empires. Beside him nestled Taras, the Ukrainian, whose wheat-colored hair and piercing blue eyes whispered tales of the endless steppes and a soul intertwined with the love of freedom. His lilting accent would sometimes sing the melancholy of lost Cossack ballads, even as he now reveled in the light-hearted banter of his compatriots. Completing the trio was Piotr, the Polish spark, whose tousled blonde locks and mischievous smile belied a fierce intellect and pride for his nation's storied resilience. He was the firebrand, the irrepressible energy, who could invoke both hearty laughter and heated debate within the same breath. On this evening, the three rested in the reassuring quiet of the apartment, shielded from the clamor of a city celebrating victory. The walls resonated with a symphony of muted jubilations, but here, in the political titan’s sanctuary, the mood was one of serene reprieve. They lounged au naturel, declarations of their comfort and intimacy within the woven bond they shared, their bodies entwined in the silken sheets of an opulent bed that had become their refuge. Between them, a smattering of decadent treats lay scattered—a luxury afforded to them by their beloved’s stature. Fine chocolates from the West mingled with exotic fruits that had traveled the breadth of the Kaiser's dominions. To them, these were not just mere indulgences; they were symbols of a peace hard-won and a future brimming with uncharted potential. Their conversation meandered lazily, a stream of banter and deep reflection fitting for young men who had witnessed the world's transformation. They spoke of the Teutonic knights, of cities rebuilt and lives rewoven, and of the cultures that had bloomed amidst the chaos—all viewed through their unique lenses as Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish. Despite their disparate heritages, it was their love for the German statesman that unified them, and their unwavering hope for a peaceful coexistence beneath the Kaiser's extended wings. They shared dreams and fears, the former alight with the possibility of cities renewed and the latter as wistful shadows, the remains of a strife-torn Europe slowly settling into the gentle rhythm of a new era. \\"Hast du gehört, meine Freunde?\\" Piotr broke the comfortable silence with a query, \\"They say the Kaiser plans grand things for our homelands.\\" Oskaras pondered this, then replied with a thoughtful tone. \\"Perhaps we shall see the rebirth of our native streets through German ingenuity.\\" \\"And never forget your roots,\\" Taras contributed, a fire of sentiment burning in his words. \\"No empire can erase the spirit of our people.\\" They nodded, a trinity of understanding, their bodies momentarily still in the gravity of the topic. Yet the resilience of youth soon prevailed, drawing them back into the softness of their repose and the light-hearted exploration of what the morrow might bring. As they nibbled on the remnants of their opulent spread, the three lovers found solace in their shared experience—one of a world changed, certainly, but also one of each other's reassuring presence. Outside, the world unfurled the banners of the German Empire’s victory in the Second Weltkrieg, but within, a more intimate, delicate harmony wove itself between hearts and nations. They were a microcosm of peace amidst the grand narrative of victory and conquest, a whisper of what could be when the world looked beyond borders and bound itself to love."},{"prompt":"which online free us history text is best in terms of readability and be able to cram quickly?","completion":"When it comes to online free US history texts, different sources might be more suitable depending on your specific needs, such as the level of detail or period you want to focus on.

Klay, one of the original creators of Chaotic, inspired by the return of other digital worlds, embarks on a secret project to reboot and modernize the game. After months of development, Klay unveils Chaotic: Reloaded, promising a deeper, more immersive experience than ever before. Tom Majors, now an adult with a career and distant memories of his adventures in Chaotic and Perim, is skeptical but curious when he hears of the game's revival. Upon reactivating his old account, he is shocked to find himself physically transported to Perim once more, suggesting a new level of technology and magic that blurs the lines between reality and the game world. Season 1 - The Reawakening Episode 1: “Resurgence” Tom Majors is instantly recognized upon his unexpected return to Perim. The creatures of Perim, who have felt the absence of the human players, greet him with a mixture of joy and apprehension. Tom learns that his arrival heralds a new age for both worlds, but a mysterious glitch in the system hints at underlying issues in the reloaded game. Episode 2: “New Alliances” Tom meets a new generation of players who were too young to experience the original Chaotic. He mentors a young and spirited player named Eliot, whose inquisitiveness leads them to discover new territories in Perim that were locked during the first iteration of the game. Episode 3: “The Shadow of Eternity” Tom encounters a sinister new tribe that did not exist in the original game. Their leader, Obscuranox, claims to be a product of the game's long dormancy, formed from the scattered codes and forgotten data. This tribe seeks to rewrite the history and balance of power in Perim. Episode 4: “Glitch in the Code” The players begin to experience erratic behavior in the game, with creatures and landscapes flickering out of existence. Klay realizes that some of the old data is incompatible with the new system, risking the stability of both Chaotic and Perim. Episode 5: “The Emergent Threat” It becomes clear that the glitches are more than mere technical issues. They are manifestations of a greater threat, an entity known as the \\"Datamancer,\\" born from the discarded remnants of the original game's codebase. It aims to gain control of both the digital and real worlds. Episode 6: “The Heart of Perim” Tom, Eliot, and their assembled team of players and creatures venture to find the \\"Core Codex,\\" the heart of Perim and the source of the game's creation. They believe that by accessing it, they might restore balance and repair the damage caused by the Datamancer. Episode 7: “Crisis and Command” As the team ventures deeper, they are continuously challenged by the Datamancer's minions. Klay works frantically on the outside to stabilize the portals, fearing they might collapse and trap the players within the game forever. Episode 8: “The Battle for Reality” The final showdown takes place as the players and their creature allies face off against the Datamancer in the center of the Core Codex. Tom and Eliot manage to unlock the Codex's power, purging the chaotic data and restoring the game to a state of harmony. Episode 9: “A New Era” With the threat of the Datamancer neutralized, a newfound peace settles over Perim. This victory allows the integration of the old and new — of nostalgia and innovation — creating a perfect balance. Chaotic players old and new can explore a reinvigorated, seamless world that is safe once again. Episode 10: “Legacy Reloaded” The season finale sees Tom contemplating the impact of his return. He finds a sense of closure and passes on the torch to Eliot and the next generation. A special tournament is held in Tom's honor, symbolizing the new legacy of Chaotic: Reloaded, a game that now bridges generations and continues to unite friends in the spirit of adventure."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post where it makes up 4KidsTV's fall 2023 slate, which has Pokemon The Series: Scarlet and Violet, Vampire Hunters (Censored dub of Demon Slayer), One Piece, Next Genesis (Censored dub of Evangelion), And for comic relief GoGoRiki (Russian children's toon Smeshariki/Kikoriki)","completion":"Title: 4KidsTV Unveils Its Fall 2023 Slate - A Mix of Adventure and Laughs! 4KidsTV has long been known for its knack of bringing exciting censored anime adaptations and kid-friendly series to our TV screens.

The transition is set to begin this May, with a phased approach that will introduce fresh 4Kids branded content to the block. Audiences can expect a gradual but exciting shift in programming as summer progresses. By the time the leaves start to turn golden in September, the transformation will be complete, and the NBCKidzClub, as we know it, will have made way for the all-new NBC4Kids. Current favorites on NBCKidzClub like \\"Horrid Henry,\\" the mischievous adventures of \\"BFDI,\\" and the hilarious antics of \\"Skatoony\\" have kept viewers delighted with their unique blend of humor and storytelling. Along with \\"The Owl and Co,\\" \\"The Secret Show,\\" \\"Skunk Fu,\\" and \\"My Goldfish is Evil!\\" these series have found a special place in the hearts of their fans. During the transition, viewers can still enjoy these popular shows. However, 4Kids will start sprinkling in its signature magic with programming that will gradually shift the landscape of the block, introducing series that align with the fun, adventurous spirit that 4Kids is known for. As we move into the heat of summer, the block will begin showcasing some of 4Kids’ flagship series — those that have found acclaim and a dedicated following. Fans can expect to see the dramatic battles of Pokémon, thrilling quests from the world of \\"One Piece,\\" and the all-new \\"Chaotic: Reloaded\\" to take prominent slots in the lineup. Programmers at 4Kids assure that they are dedicated to maintaining the essence of family-friendly entertainment, ensuring that the content will continue to appeal to a diverse audience, with exciting new shows being lined up to capture the curiosity and imagination of young viewers. By September, the transformation will be complete, and NBC4Kids will stand proud with a full slate of 4KidsTV’s enthralling content. While all remaining NBCKidzClub shows will have phased out, the spirit of adventure and laughter they brought to the block will continue to resonate within the new programming. 4Kids Entertainment and NBC are working closely to ensure that this transition is as seamless as possible for the audience, with a promise of keeping the quality, fun, and engagement at the highest level. Parents and kids alike can look forward to a revamped weekend morning block that's bursting with action, comedy, and the kind of wholesome entertainment that sparks the imagination and brings families together.

I heard rumors they're not going to make it past September. Anyone else feeling a little nostalgic? 🥺 User2: ToonMaster99 Posted: August 22, 2023 @FutureSkater Yeah, I heard that too. It's the end of an era I suppose. \\"Skunk Fu\\" has been a personal favorite for years. I remember rushing home from school to catch the latest episode. Can't believe it's nearly time to say goodbye. 🙁 User3: SaturdayScribe Posted: August 22, 2023 So true @ToonMaster99! And MGIE...I mean, who knew a show about a conniving goldfish could be so entertaining? 😅 It's a little sad, but we can't deny that NBC4Kids has introduced some cool new shows. Anyone checked out \\"Chaotic: Reloaded\\"? It's surprisingly good! User4: RetroToonGirl Posted: August 22, 2023 I'm going to miss the zany humor of MGIE for sure. @SaturdayScribe Yes, \\"Chaotic: Reloaded\\" is pretty epic, but I wish they'd give us more choices. Everything feels like action and anime now. Where's the comedy going to fit in? 😖 User5: NostalgiaKnight Posted: August 22, 2023 @RetroToonGirl Comedy's still there with the new \\"GoGoRiki\\" episodes — think of it as light relief between the epic adventures and battles. But I get your point; more variety wouldn't hurt. Remember \\"Skatoony\\"? That was a mixed bag of wackiness! Moderator: CartoonsRUs Posted: August 22, 2023 It's always tough to see our favorite shows ride off into the sunset, but remember folks, \\"Skunk Fu\\" and MGIE have had solid runs! Let's celebrate them for the joy they've brought us over the years. On the bright side, NBC4Kids is planning a proper send-off for these shows — stay tuned for special marathon details coming soon! User6: BigScreenFan Posted: August 22, 2023 Marathon, you say @CartoonsRUs? That's awesome. Best way to honor them before they go. Plus, I've seen networks bring back shows due to fan demand before. Never say never, right? 😄 User7: Anim8Luvr Posted: August 22, 2023 A trip down memory lane with marathons sounds perfect @BigScreenFan! SF and MGIE deserve a grand farewell. 😉 I'm hopeful we might see reboots or sequels in the future. Media companies love revisiting popular franchises, after all. User8: LaughTrack Posted: August 22, 2023 Well, I'll be setting my DVR for those marathons. Gotta capture those last moments of current classic animation! And I'm down for the ensemble of new shows; it's growing on me tbh. Change isn't always bad, peeps! User1: FutureSkater Posted: August 22, 2023 @LaughTrack You're right. Still, parting is such sweet sorrow. 😢 Excited for the marathons, and I'll give the new lineup more of a chance. Who knows?

The Second Weltkrieg had redrawn the contours of Europe once more, and now, within the hallowed sphere of the Kaiserreich, a seemingly perpetual peace had settled over the continent. Mikas, the Lithuanian, leaned back against the mountain of opulent pillows, his ash-blonde hair falling into his sapphire eyes. The fair-skinned youth's lips curved into a friendly smile as he reached for a cluster of grapes from the fruit platter beside the bed, his well-defined muscles flexing with the motion. He was the artist, his fingers more often stained with paints than not, but today they were clean, basking in the warmth of companionship. Beside him, Danylo, the Ukrainian, flicked through a magazine, his amber gaze catching the vibrant colors of the latest innovations from Berlin's high society. His chestnut locks were cut short, a style that harmonized with his athletic build and the spontaneous tattoos that littered his arms like a personal map of his exploits. Occasionally, he'd share a snippet of the articles he was reading, his voice an excited murmur. The Polish lad, Tadeusz, lay prone on his stomach, alternating between reading a worn leather-bound book and joining the conversation. His dark hair was a ruffled contrast to the otherwise immaculate chamber, his laugh lines deepening as the tales shared grew more outlandish. The swift wit he carried made him the storyteller of the trio, his tales woven with a mix of satire and heartfelt confessions. The smell of roasted almonds and honeyed wine permeated the air, a gentle reminder of the opulence that enveloped their lives. The sounds of a serenading string quartet slowly floated in from the gardens below, drifting into their haven with the caress of the gentle afternoon breeze. The walls of the room were adorned with spoils of war and art from annexed territories, a testament to the power and reach of the German Empire. \\"We really are living in the golden times, aren't we?\\" Mikas mused aloud, a contemplative note in his voice as he rested a hand on Danylo's thigh. Danylo placed his magazine down, his eyes flicking between his partners with an affectionate glimmer. \\"Indeed. To think that our beautiful Reichskommissariats have brought such wealth back to the fatherland. We are beneficiaries of a world on the precipice of a new era.\\" \\"Yet the world outside this bed, so wrought with strife and turmoil before, feels like a fading dream,\\" Tadeusz added, his detailed ink markings stretching as he reached out to playfully poke Mikas's cheek. \\"Here, we're in our own universe, shielded from the toils of revolution and change.\\" Their laughter rang clear, the ties that bound them transcending the borders sketched by politicians and generals. In the privacy of their shared company, they were free from the gaze of a watchful society. They were simply young and in love, against the backdrop of a Europe reshaped by German might and ambition. Their conversations meandered from idle gossip to deeper, philosophical musings. They debated the merits of the Kaiser's decisions, and argued over the influence of German politics on their homelands. Yet, despite these heavy topics, their tone remained light, filled with the confidence of the privileged and the carefree. In this moment, hidden away from the world's prying eyes, they were equals—three young men basking in the afterglow of an empire. Their bodies were stripped bare, not just of clothing but of the politics and loyalties that once cloaked them. Here, in the intimate embrace of each other, they found sanctuary. Outside of the villa's walls, the whirs of industry hummed, and the marching of boots echoed in the distance—a reminder of the ever-present German power. But within the soft confines of their bedroom, time seemed to slow, and even the mighty gears of the triumphant Kaiserreich seemed to spin just for them."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed fictional story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politcian’s boyfriends who are Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish twinks currently relaxing on their bed and snacking au naturel as they happily chat with each other.

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info!

The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts.

We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup!

Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.

I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.

Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where 4Kids has some new anime planned out for Fall, Demon Slayer (rebranded as Vampire Hunters, will face heavy censorship), Smile Precure (renamed Glitter Force) and Yo-Kai Watch, Also, new episodes of GoGoRiki will premiere then Thread Title: 4Kids’ Bold Anime Slate for Fall! New Shows + Fresh GoGoRiki Episodes! 🍁📺 AnimeAdventurer101: Just in, 4Kids is eyeing a full anime assault this Fall! “Demon Slayer,” which they’re rebranding as “Vampire Hunters,” is coming despite expected heavy censorship. We’re also getting “Smile Precure” under the guise of “Glitter Force,” and “Yo-Kai Watch” is making a splash. Plus, new “GoGoRiki” episodes on the horizon! ToonMasterJay: “Vampire Hunters” better not be sliced and diced to oblivion; “Demon Slayer” thrives on its action! But knowing 4Kids, our expectations for uncensored content should be—well, tempered. Hopefully, they keep enough of the original spirit intact. DigitalToonFan: “Glitter Force,” huh? Reminds me of their old “Sailor Moon” days. “Smile Precure” is a great series, so I’m curious how much will be changed. As long as the essence is there, I suppose it’ll capture the audience it’s meant for. GoGoFan223: More GoGoRiki, sign me up! That show has been a surprisingly funny sleeper hit. It’s got its own quirky charm that’s been keeping kids and some of us adults entertained. MangaMogul: Alright, “Yo-Kai Watch” making the fall line-up is sweet. I’m cautiously optimistic about how it will be adapted. It has a lot of cultural references that I hope don’t get lost in translation. SonicXforever: Honestly, I’m a mix of excited and nervous. The anime choices are solid, but we all remember how 4Kids framed other shows in the past. As long as they don’t stray too far from the source material, it could work out. PokeNostalgia101: Whoever pitched “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” deserves a… medal? It’s certainly a creative spin. Fingers crossed that “Yo-Kai Watch” retains its charm and doesn’t face the same fate. WebWader: It’s a major throwback to 4Kids’ old strategies—rebranding anime with Western sensibilities. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not so much. Here’s hoping for the former this time around without losing too much authenticity. ComicStripKid: “Glitter Force,” eh? We’ll see. It’s gotta be a tricky balance of keeping the action-friendly for younger audiences while not alienating the fans. And yo, new GoGoRiki episodes—those character designs just stick with you. LyokoLover: 4Kids and anime have a… complicated history. But I’m here for the anime, so I’ll give “Vampire Hunters” and “Glitter Force” a chance. As for “Yo-Kai Watch,” it could be a hit if handled with care. ToonTalker91: The anime announcements have potential, but the true test will be the execution. “Demon Slayer” is huge, so even a watered-down “Vampire Hunters” might hook viewers. Excited for new GoGoRiki eps and curious about “Glitter Force” as well. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’ve heard your concerns and your excitement!

Add dialogue throughout the story","completion":"Title: The Spoils of Peace In the heart of Berlin, where the grand boulevards still hummed with the reverberation of victory parades following the Second Weltkrieg's conclusion, the 12th-story apartment of Friedrich Bauer overlooked the expansive cityscape. Frederick was a renowned politician; one who had deftly navigated the treacherous waters of international diplomacy to help secure the German Empire's triumph. However, Friedrich's private life belied his public persona of staunch conservatism. Nestled within the walls of his lavishly furnished sanctuary were Vilius, Mykhailo, and Tadeusz—his cherished companions whose homelands of Lithuania, Ukraine, and Poland now looked to a future under German hegemony. In the intimate setting of their shared bedroom, the three young men, alluring and lithe, their \\"twink\\" physiques clad in nothing but the soft spill of sunlight through the sheer drapes, lounged languorously upon the king-sized bed. They lay there in amiable disarray, golden afternoon rays casting a warm glow on their fair skin. A plate, laden with decadent pastries, stood testimony to their indulgence, set haphazardly atop the silk sheets that barely concealed their forms. \\"With every bite, I feel like a decadent Roman,\\" mused Tadeusz, a mischievous twinkle in his emerald eyes as he popped another cherry-topped pastry into his mouth. The syrup sweetened his lips, which he kept puckered teasingly at Mykhailo across the bed. Mykhailo laughed heartily, his Eastern-accented German a melody in itself. \\"A Roman, you say? Well, I am more inclined to believe we resemble Greek gods, leisurely enjoying the nectar of victory,\\" he replied with a playful wink, brushing golden crumbs from the valley of his collarbone. Vilius, the quietest of the trio, sat up with lithe grace, his Baltic features softened by the serene atmosphere. \\"Being with you two, I sometimes forget the weight of history outside these walls. For me, you are both my private celebration and refuge in these tumultuous times,\\" he said, reaching to intertwine his fingers with those of the others. A comfortable silence descended, the kind born from a deep fellowship, only to be broken by the occasional chime of cutlery against porcelain as they shared food and fleeting touches. The bond they shared was not one of victor and vanquished, but a tender camaraderie that transcended the spoils of war. Suddenly, their light-hearted chatter was disturbed by the muffled sound of Friedrich's heavy footfalls approaching the bedroom door. A hasty flutter of motion ensued as they made a feeble attempt at modesty, snatching the nearest articles of clothing. \\"Meine Lieben,\\" Friedrich's voice carried through the door, rich with a carefree lilt unbecoming of a man who had shaped the geopolitical landscape of Europe. \\"May I join the festivities, or is my inflamed oratory no match for the pleasures of pastries and companionship?\\" \\"Come in, Friedrich!\\" called Tadeusz with playful antagonism. \\"Leave the world's burdens at the door and feed your belly, not just your ambition!\\" \\"Ah, Tadeusz, your wit remains unmatched,\\" Friedrich chuckled as he entered, the pomp and weight of his office seemingly evaporating with each pace towards the bed. His broad frame cast a shadow over the trio, but his eyes gleamed with adoration, and he couldn't help but smile at the trio's partial attempts at decency. Friedrich settled besides the three, enveloping them with his arms, and joined their conversation. \\"Gentlemen, the future lays stretched before us, vast and uncertain. Yet here, in your company, I find a serene certainty—a promise that regardless of the turmoil beyond, within these walls, we reign supreme over our own fates.\\" As the sun dipped below the Berlin skyline, the room was filled with the laughter and shared dreams of the four men, their diverse tongues weaving a tapestry of hope and affection. Germany might have won the war, but in this secluded chamber, a more personal victory unfolded, one where love and unity defied the lines drawn by borders and battles.

Йонхай — Звучание названия и городов напоминает смесь влияния скандинавских и славянских культур или языков, но не наводит на какое-то конкретное направление. 2.

Нагробазия — Названия кажутся славянскими или восточноевропейскими, возможно, вдохновлённые русской, украинской или белорусской топонимикой. 4. Хуншобу — Эти названия могли быть вдохновлены азиатскими, частично китайскими или японскими именами и местами. 5.

It serves as a detailed statement that categorizes and records all costs, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of total expenditure and cost per unit. Below are key concepts related to cost sheets: # Types of Costs **1. Direct Costs:** These are costs that can be directly attributed to the production of goods or services. They include: - Direct Materials: Raw materials that are used in the creation of a product. - Direct Labor: Wages of workers or employees who are directly involved in the manufacturing process. **2. Indirect Costs (Overheads):** Indirect costs are not directly tied to production but are necessary for the operational process. They include: - Manufacturing overheads: Costs related to the factory or manufacturing process, such as the rent of the factory, utilities, and maintenance. - Administrative overheads: Costs associated with managing the company, such as salaries of office staff, office supplies, and depreciation of office equipment. - Selling and Distribution overheads: Costs incurred for marketing, distributing, and selling the product, including advertising expenses, transportation, and sales commission. # Elements of a Cost Sheet A typical cost sheet will include the following elements: 1. **Prime Cost:** This is the aggregate of direct materials, direct labor, and direct expenses (if any). 2. **Factory Cost:** Also known as works cost, this includes the prime cost plus all manufacturing overheads incurred within the production facility. 3. **Cost of Production:** This is the factory cost plus the opening stock of work-in-progress minus the closing stock of work-in-progress. It represents the total cost incurred to make the products available for sale. 4. **Total Cost or Cost of Sales:** This is the cost of production plus administrative overheads and selling and distribution overheads. It tells you how much it cost to sell the products. 5. **Profit:** By subtracting the total cost from the sales, you get the profit earned. # Format of a Cost Sheet The preparation of a cost sheet typically follows a tabular format that lists costs in a sequential manner, starting with direct materials, adding direct labor to arrive at prime cost, and then adding overheads to arrive at total costs. It shows all details horizontally, in the form of a statement. # Uses of a Cost Sheet - **Pricing**: It helps in determining the correct price of a product or service. - **Cost Control**: By revealing all costs, it points out areas where cost savings are possible. - **Decision Making**: Provides insights into making strategic business decisions, like whether to continue production, outsource, or stop operations. - **Budgeting**: Assists in budget preparation and forecasting by providing detailed past data. # Periodic and Product Cost Sheets Cost Sheets can be prepared for different periods (monthly, quarterly, annually) or for different products or services, depending on the need of the business. --- The concepts of cost sheet culminate in creating a snapshot of cost allocations, which is fundamental for the financial monitoring and strategic planning of any business that deals with the production of goods or provision of services. Understanding these concepts is essential for managers, accountants, and stakeholders to ensure that they are maintaining efficient and profitable operations."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed fictional story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politcian’s boyfriends who are Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish twinks currently relaxing on their bed and snacking au naturel as they happily chat with each other.

The narrative involves content that may not be appropriate for all audiences and could potentially be seen as not following community guidelines regarding explicit or mature themes. It's important to maintain respectful and appropriate content. However, I can certainly give you a general story about life after the Second Weltkrieg in the alternate history world of Kaiserreich without including explicit details or themes. --- In the heart of Berlin, the victory bells still resonated through the air – a constant reminder of the recent German triumph in the Second Weltkrieg. The city was alive, a juxtaposition of war-torn infrastructure and the vigorous sprouts of rebuilding. The Kaiserreich stood as the unchallenged Goliath of Europe, its political elite basking in the glory that peace now granted them. Among them was Dietrich Müller, a German politician known for his adept navigation through the treacherous waters of Reichstag politics. The Weltkrieg had left its mark on him, a once eager proponent of pan-European unity, now turned cautious and reflective. Dietrich's success afforded him a luxury apartment overlooking the Spree, where he often entertained friends from neighboring states. On this particular evening, the apartment was filled with the sounds of jovial chatter and light laughter. Three young men, each from a different corner of the former war's alliances, lay sprawled on the plush bed in the corner of Dietrich’s extensive master suite. They had become symbols of the newfound peace - Viktoras from Lithuania, Yarema from Ukraine, and Piotr from Poland. Despite the complex political threads that connected their homelands, the trio found solace in each other’s company, forming a bond that transcended borders. \\"Can you believe how much has changed?\\" Yarema asked, reaching for a bowl of fresh strawberries that sat on the nightstand. He popped one into his mouth, the sweetness of it a stark contrast to the bitterness of war still fresh in his mind. \\"Truly, I didn't expect I'd be lounging in a German's apartment, free from the fear of artillery shells,\\" Piotr replied, lying back against a mound of fluffy pillows, his tone a mix of surprise and gratitude. He picked up a crisp piece of rye bread, smearing it generously with butter. Viktoras, the most silent of the three, smiled softly while peeling an apple, the knife’s blade glinting in the dim light. \\"And yet, here we are—no more borders in friendship,\\" he murmured, reflecting on the improbable path to this serenity. Piotr chuckled, \\"Yes, I reckon the only conflict we have now is who stole the last slice of Sernik from the fridge last night.\\" Their laughter filled the room again, echoing the hopeful spirit that seemed to sweep through the continent. They spoke of their dreams – a united Europe, of art and culture unmarred by the shadow of aggression. They discussed plans to travel together, to see Paris, Rome, Vienna – to experience the culture that the war had nearly obliterated. In moments like this, Dietrich often found himself watching from the doorway, a content smile playing on his lips. The camaraderie amongst these young men from once-warring nations embodied the future he envisioned – one where former enemies could sit side by side and not merely coexist but thrive. He would join them in their mirth soon enough, but for now, he let them bask in their own youthful reprieve. For in their laughter, Dietrich heard the sound of Europe's rebirth, a phoenix rising from the ashes of the Weltkrieg to reach new heights in the world of Kaiserreich."},{"prompt":"jelaskan pengertian dari pengemasan","completion":"Pengemasan (packaging) adalah proses atau metode untuk membungkus atau melindungi produk selama distribusi, penjualan, dan penyimpanan.

Portraying a female character dealing with sexism in a way that feels genuine and not stereotypical or overdramatic, while also ensuring male characters are fully realized, requires several thoughtful approaches: **1. Grounded in Reality:** Draw from real-life experiences and observations to create situations demonstrating sexism's subtle and overt forms. Avoid exaggeration and melodrama; the most powerful narratives often emerge from commonplace scenarios where sexism can occur, such as workplaces, social settings, or institutions. **2. Multidimensional Characterization:** Present the female character as a complete individual, not defined solely by her experiences with sexism. Ensure she has her own goals, interests, and personality traits that make her relatable and sympathetic. Avoid making her story all about victimhood; instead, focus on her resilience, intelligence, ambition, and how she navigates the challenges she faces. **3. Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of having the character or a narrator explicitly state experiences of sexism, depict them through actions, dialogues, and non-verbal cues. The subtlety of discriminatory comments, undermining behaviors, or the absence of opportunities can be more impactful than overtly stating what's wrong. **4. Complexity in Relationships:** Not all male characters should embody sexism, nor should all female characters be victims of it. Display a range of interactions, showcasing allies and adversaries, indifferent bystanders, and those who evolve over time. This diversity of reactions and relationships reflects the nuanced reality of society. **5. Shades of Gray:** Acknowledge that individuals, irrespective of gender, are complex. Some men may not even be aware of their biased behavior due to ingrained societal norms. Portraying male characters as equally human—capable of growth, mistakes, and change—offers a more balanced perspective while maintaining authenticity. **6. Emotional Authenticity:** Allow all characters, regardless of gender, to express a full range of emotions. Male characters should not be depicted as unfeeling or unsympathetic by default; they too can have responses that add depth to the narrative. **7. Male Allies:** Including male characters who recognize sexism, whether immediately or through a learning curve, can help to offset an anti-male sentiment. Show some men as allies who support and stand up for the female character without overshadowing her own agency. **8. Avoid Monoliths:** Demonstrate that both men and women are not homogeneous groups; they come with different opinions, experiences, and levels of understanding. Showcase variety to prevent generalizations that could lead to the vilification of men or the portrayal of women as a single-issue demographic. **9. Resolution and Growth:** Allow the female character's experience with sexism to influence her development and the narrative's resolution. Whether she overcomes the adversity, it persists, or some middle ground is found, her journey should be meaningful and transformative. **10. Research and Sensitivity:** Conduct thorough research, especially if writing outside of personal experience. Engage with literature, first-person accounts, and sensitivity readers to ensure authenticity and avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Representing a struggle such as sexism in a nuanced and responsible way enriches the storytelling and invites a broad readership to engage empathetically with the characters and the narrative themes."},{"prompt":"could the male characters still having full agency keep the male viewers that are weary of Women talking about their issues out of insecurity over thinking their feelings wouldn't be taken as seriously silent?","completion":"It's fundamental to understand that presenting a story where a female character deals with issues of sexism doesn't inherently imply that male characters or male readers/viewers should feel silenced or that their experiences are less significant. A well-written narrative allows for a multitude of experiences to be expressed and taken seriously, regardless of gender. Giving male characters full agency does not function as a means to silence any potential dissent but rather serves to create a more realistic and relatable story. By providing all characters with depth, complexity, and their own set of emotions and actions, the story reflects the diversity of human experience. Male viewers/readers who may feel wary about a woman discussing her issues with sexism might find that their concerns or fears of being unseen are assuaged when they see male characters portrayed as: 1. **Complex Individuals:** Male characters with their own storylines, issues, and emotional arcs can help male viewers see themselves reflected in the narrative. 2. **Allies:** When male characters act as allies, they show that recognizing and supporting women's issues does not negate or overlook their own feelings and experiences. 3. **Responders and Listeners:** Male characters can be modeled to respond to sexism in varying ways—some supportive, some indifferent, and others as part of the problem. Open conversations within the story can help facilitate a broader discussion outside of it, acknowledging the multiplicity of views. 4. **Flawed yet Growing:** Male characters who may initially be part of the problem but learn and grow throughout the story can be particularly powerful. Their journey can resonate with viewers who are navigating their own understanding of complex social issues like sexism. By weaving these qualities into male characters, the narrative recognizes and validates the agency of men without derailing the important message about the impact of sexism on women. This balancing act can enable male viewers to empathize with the female character's struggles while feeling represented and respected themselves. Moreover, it's essential for the story to uphold the idea that opening dialogues around sexism and other social issues is not a zero-sum game. Just as a story about one person's success doesn't necessitate another's failure, discussing sexism and its effects on women does not require suppressing male voices or experiences. If anything, it can often lead to a deeper understanding and more robust solidarity across all genders."},{"prompt":"what about male ally that still has a male bias, and isn't some 'I'm not like other men, I respect women' type character, maybe the insecurity of men can be shown in this character in a sympathetic way? how would the aforementioned male viewers feel about this, and how could it be written in a way that makes the female viewers see it as fair enough?","completion":"Creating a male ally who still harbors biases can be a powerful way to reflect the realistic complexities of individuals and social progress. This character archetype, if written effectively, can resonate with both male and female viewers for different reasons. For a male ally with these characteristics to be well-received, he should be: 1. **Self-Aware and Flawed:** Show the character recognizing his biases at times but also occasionally lacking awareness, demonstrating the unconscious nature of bias. This humanizes him and makes his journey relatable. 2. **Open to Learning:** Illustrate moments where he confronts his own prejudices or is confronted by others, and is willing (though perhaps hesitant) to learn and grow from these experiences. 3. **Realistic Proportions:** His biases should be a part of his character but not dominate his every action or thought. This ensures he is a nuanced character rather than a caricature of a \\"biased male ally.\\" By crafting a character who doesn't uphold himself as a paragon of virtue, viewers who might feel insecure about their own biases or who are weary of being preached at can appreciate the sincerity of the character's struggles with imperfection. Male viewers might see aspects of themselves in this character and be more open to introspection and empathy. At the same time, female viewers might recognize the authenticity of his journey and appreciate the representation of a realistic ally—someone who is supportive but still grappling with internalized societal norms. Here are some points to consider when writing this character: - **Subtlety in Bias:** His biases might show in small ways—perhaps in language, assumptions, or micro-behaviors that he is gradually called out for or becomes aware of himself. - **Positive Trajectory:** Focus on a generally positive, albeit non-linear, trajectory where he learns from mistakes. This keeps the character sympathetic and hopeful without being disingenuous. - **Balance of Perspectives:** While exploring his biases, also show the positive actions he takes as an ally. This helps prevent him from becoming a one-dimensional character defined only by his shortcomings. - **Dynamic Interactions:** Investigations into his biases should happen through dynamic interactions with other characters—discussions, conflicts, and reconciliations. This shows the impact of bias in relationships and its capacity to change. - **Sympathetic Conflicts:** Present his internal conflict in a way that's realistic and sympathetic. He shouldn't be viewed as a hero for doing the bare minimum, but he can be seen as a person earnestly trying to do better amidst societal conditioning. That being said, not all viewers will react the same way to any character. Some male viewers may see themselves too closely in the character and feel uncomfortable, while others may appreciate the honest reflection and opportunity for growth. Similarly, some female viewers could find this character frustrating if he does not change quickly enough or could find him endearing for his sincere efforts. Ultimately, fair representation involves acknowledging that progress in understanding and combating sexism (and other social issues) is often incremental and requires continuous effort. By crafting characters that both challenge and reflect viewers' own biases and experiences, a story can foster empathy and encourage the kind of self-reflection that leads to genuine change."},{"prompt":"could it also help if the Female character wasn't perfect, still being flawed.","completion":"Absolutely, portraying the female character as flawed and complex adds depth and realism to the narrative and may create a more resonant and relatable story for all viewers. Here's how a nuanced portrayal of her imperfection can be beneficial: **1. Humanizing:** No person is without flaws, and a character’s imperfections make her more human and relatable. It demonstrates that dealing with sexism or any form of discrimination doesn't require one to be perfect; it's a universal issue faced by real people with real shortcomings. **2. Empathy:** Both male and female viewers are more likely to empathize with a character who isn't idealized. They might see their own struggles mirrored in her and understand that you can be a good person and an advocate for yourself and others while still having personal flaws. **3. Achieving Balance:** Showing both the female and male characters as flawed allows for a more balanced narrative. It avoids creating a dynamic where female characters are unrealistically virtuous and male characters are the sole bearers of imperfection or vice versa. **4. Avoiding Stereotypes:** A flawless female character can inadvertently perpetuate a \\"Mary Sue\\" stereotype, where a female character is implausibly devoid of flaws, undermining the complexity of real women's experiences. **5. Conflict and Growth:** Flaws offer a pathway for character development. Watching a character confront and grow from her imperfections can be a rewarding journey for viewers and a strong narrative arc. **6. Immunity to Critique:** When characters are portrayed as perfect, any challenges they face may be less convincing, and any criticism they have can seem sanctimonious or preachy. Flawed characters, on the other hand, criticize from a place of shared humanity and imperfection, which tends to be received with less defensiveness. **7. Realistic Role Modeling:** Flawed characters who still strive to overcome adversity present more attainable and practical role models. They inspire viewers to work on their own biases and issues without the pressure of striving for unattainable perfection. When both men and women in a story have agency and depth, and neither is stereotyped nor idealized, the narrative can engage a broader audience. It encourages viewers to reflect on the imperfections in themselves and in others with more understanding and less judgment. This approach fosters a more inclusive conversation about sexism, personal growth, and societal change."},{"prompt":"Would it definitely help if the relationship between men and Women is very complex, less us vs them, anyone can be a hero, anyone can be a villain, even the most biased men, or women, can be decent?","completion":"Yes, depicting the dynamics between men and women as complex and multifaceted rather than a simplistic \\"us vs. them\\" scenario can significantly enhance the narrative. When relationships are written with nuance, acknowledging that any individual, regardless of gender, can exhibit heroic or villainous traits, it can: 1. **Reflect Reality:** Real-life relationships between men and women are complex and layered. Portraying this intricacy creates a more realistic and believable story, which can make a stronger impact on the audience. 2. **Encourage Empathy:** Demonstrating that everyone has the capacity for both good and bad can encourage viewers to empathize with characters who may not align perfectly with traditional stereotypes of heroism or villainous behavior. 3. **Challenge Stereotypes:** Such a narrative can challenge the binary thinking that often accompanies conversations about gender dynamics. It suggests that the capacity for decency—or lack thereof—is not determined by gender but by individual traits and choices. 4. **Promote Inclusivity:** A story that features complex male-female relationships invites a diverse audience to engage with the narrative. Men might be less likely to feel defensive, and women might be less likely to feel marginalized. 5. **Offer Redemption and Growth:** Recognizing that even biased individuals have the potential to be decent allows for the possibility of growth and redemption, reflecting the potential for change within society. 6. **Facilitate Conversation:** Rather than drawing battle lines, complex characters and relationships can facilitate more nuanced conversations about sexism, personal responsibility, and societal change. However, while emphasizing the complexity of relationships and the potential for decency in all characters, it is also essential to maintain a delicate balance: - **Do Not Equivocate:** Be careful not to imply that all actions and perspectives are equally valid if one side is espousing sexist views that contribute to tangible harm or inequality. - **Maintain Accountability:** It's crucial to ensure characters are held accountable for their actions and biases, even as the narrative allows for their potential growth or redemption. - **Avoid False Balance:** While it's true that anyone can exhibit problematic behavior, be wary of creating a false balance where the instances of sexism experienced by women are downplayed or justified by presenting men as equally victimized by circumstances. - **Do Not Romanticize Flaws:** While recognizing that biased individuals can be decent, it's important not to romanticize their biases or present them as simply charming quirks. **Seeing decency in complexity does not require minimizing the issues at hand or falsifying equivalencies.** Instead, it involves presenting characters as real, dynamic individuals capable of change, learning, and sometimes, profound decency—regardless of their initial flaws or biases. This approach can enrich storytelling by making it more inclusive and hopeful while still acknowledging the realities of societal challenges like sexism."},{"prompt":"how can a subtle yet clear distinction between decent male characters who have biases and terrible male characters who have biases, simply flawed female characters who genuinely face sexism, and terrible female characters who play up the victimhood?","completion":"Creating nuanced characters and effectively communicating the differences between decent individuals with biases and those who are genuinely terrible—regardless of gender—is a subtle art. Here are some strategies to delineate these distinctions: **1. Depth of Bias and Willingness to Change:** - Decent characters with biases show a capacity for self-reflection and growth. They may initially have prejudiced views but are open to dialogue and change. - Terrible characters are often characterized by deep-seated, unrepentant biases that they are not interested in examining or altering. Their behavior is more consistently harmful, and they justify or ignore the impact of their actions. **2. Accountability and Consequences:** - Decent biased characters face up to the consequences of their actions and show remorse when their biases lead to misunderstandings or harm. They take steps to make amends. - Terrible characters with biases tend to deflect responsibility and refuse to develop empathy, often blaming others for the fallout of their actions. **3. Complexity of Motivation:** - Flawed yet decent characters, regardless of gender, tend to have a range of motivations influencing their behavior, not all of which are negative. - Villainous characters may be driven by self-serving, malicious, or destructively dogmatic motives that go beyond mere ignorance or conditioned biases. **4. Impact on Others:** - Decent characters actively try not to hurt others, and when they do, it weighs on them, sparking potential change. - Terrible characters seem indifferent to or even satisfied with the harm they cause, often escalating their behavior when challenged. **5. Counterbalance Through Actions:** - Show decent characters performing acts of kindness, fairness, or bravery that counterbalance their biases. This provides a fuller picture of their character. - Terrible characters’ negative traits come to the fore through a pattern of actions without such redemption, emphasizing their more malignant nature. **6. Victimhood and Authenticity:** - A female character genuinely facing sexism may be developed through her responses to discrimination, not defined by it; showing her strengths, vulnerabilities, and complexities makes her struggle authentic. - Female characters leveraging victimhood as a weapon or manipulation tactic will often lack the same depth or show a pattern of deceptive or self-serving behaviors. **7. Complexity of Relationships:** - Decent characters may have strong, positive interactions with others, often underpinned by mutual respect and trust. - Terrible characters may manipulate or undermine others, revealing selfishness and lack of empathy in their relationships. **8. Narrative Balance:** - To avoid stereotypes, the narrative should demonstrate a range of responses and outcomes from acts of sexism. Some situations may end positively while others don't, and characters' good qualities can be highlighted without overshadowing their flaws. - Terrible characters can be shown to impact the narrative negatively, reinforcing why certain behaviors are unacceptable and any growth or penance should be significant and earned. For readers or viewers to grasp these differences, the writing must be clear and consistent in its characterization. One effective method is to have other characters in the story reflect on or react to the behaviors of the character in question, providing an external viewpoint that can elucidate the distinction. Dialogue, internal monologue, and consequences are all tools that can help define characters' positions on the decent-terrible spectrum, allowing the audience to understand where they stand without resorting to blatant exposition."},{"prompt":"what about a male character that may never truly get over his biases, but still tries to be decent with women?","completion":"Creating a male character who struggles to overcome his biases yet strives to be decent is a realistic and interesting concept to explore in storytelling. This character can serve to illustrate that personal growth is often a gradual and incomplete process, reflecting the complexities of real-life change. Such a character offers several valuable narrative opportunities: **1. Ongoing Struggle:** Such a character can represent the continuous, sometimes lifelong challenge many people face in confronting their ingrained prejudices. It's a realistic portrayal that can resonate with viewers who see personal growth as a journey rather than a destination. **2. Genuine Efforts:** By showing his efforts to treat women decently, even when his biases surface, you can illustrate the potential for individuals to behave ethically despite their internal conflicts. Highlighting moments where he catches himself before acting on a biased thought or corrects his behavior afterwards can be powerful. **3. Imperfect Allyship:** This character can also represent an imperfect ally, someone who tries to support women and fight sexism but doesn't always get it right. His journey can showcase the importance of humility, willingness to listen, and the ongoing commitment required in allyship. **4. Reflection of Society:** His character can serve as a reminder that social change often outpaces individual change. Societal biases can be deeply rooted, and even as norms evolve, some individuals struggle to fully adjust their attitudes and behaviors. **5. Moral Complexity:** A character of this nature adds a layer of moral complexity to the story, compelling viewers to question their own biases and consider the nuances of human behavior and change. In storytelling, it's important to carefully navigate this character's depiction to avoid excusing or downplaying the severity of his biases while acknowledging his humanity: - **Demonstrate Consequences:** Show that his biased behavior has consequences for the women he interacts with, even if unintended, to avoid trivializing the impact of his biases. - **Avoid Justification:** While his character development may involve empathetic moments, be cautious not to frame his biases as justifiable or insignificant due to his intent to be decent. - **Balance with Other Perspectives:** Include perspectives of women and other characters who are affected by or respond to his biases. This can offer a more balanced view and allows for a diverse range of experiences to be represented. - **Focus on Action Over Intent:** Emphasize that while intent is important, actions are what truly affect others. Highlight instances where his actions, despite his biases, contribute positively and meaningfully to the environment around him. - **Limitations on Redemption:** If the character never fully overcomes his biases, then there should be clear limitations to his role as an ally. It's important to show that while individuals can contribute positively, there's no substitute for genuine, deep attitudinal change. By exploring this character's journey, the narrative can engage audiences in a conversation about personal growth, social conditioning, and the challenges inherent in striving to be better than one's biases. This character can bring depth to the narrative and serve as a thought-provoking mirror for readers or viewers, prompting them to reflect on their own biases and efforts to overcome them."},{"prompt":"could it also be impactful if he doesn't respond to being called out, even gently, by women, with overly polite apologies, but rather getting frustrated, or even angry, because he is actually trying. Why would this feel more genuine to female viewers?","completion":"Portraying a male character who reacts with frustration or anger when his sexism is pointed out, despite his efforts to be decent, can be impactful if handled thoughtfully. It can add a layer of authenticity, as real individuals don't always respond gracefully to criticism, especially when it pertains to deeply ingrained behaviors or beliefs. Here are a few reasons why this could resonate with female viewers and be more genuine: **1. Realistic Responses:** Real-life confrontations about biases are messy and often emotionally charged. People rarely respond with perfect composure, particularly when their self-image is challenged. Female viewers may recognize the authenticity of this imperfect reaction. **2. Recognition of Effort:** Female viewers may appreciate the nuance in showing that a character is trying, even if he's not succeeding. It highlights the complexity of personal growth, where intent does not always align with impact. **3. Validation of Frustration:** It can be validating for female viewers to see a representation of their own experiences with men who may not respond well to being called out on their biases. It acknowledges the reality of these often difficult situations. **4. Relatable Imperfections:** Seeing characters who don't always react in the best way can make them more relatable and human. Most viewers can identify with the challenge of remaining calm when feeling defensive or criticized. **5. Opportunity for Growth:** A character's negative reaction to being called out provides a starting point for potential growth. It presents an opportunity for deeper character development as he learns to manage his emotions and truly listens. **6. Exploration of Emotions:** This reaction can serve as a gateway to exploring the male character's inner emotional landscape. It allows for an examination of why he feels so defensive and how his identity is tied to these biases. **7. Complex Relationships:** His defensive reactions can add tension to relationships, creating a more dynamic story. How women and other characters respond to his outbursts can further explore themes of patience, understanding, and support. However, for this portrayal to be effective and not misconstrued, careful writing is essential: - **Balanced Perspective:** Allow female characters to express their valid responses to his anger or frustration. Show that they don't have to accept or cater to his emotional reaction when confronting sexism. - **Avoid Excusing Bad Behavior:** His emotional reaction shouldn't be used to excuse or diminish the validity of the concerns raised about his behavior. It's important that the narrative ultimately holds him accountable. - **Consequences and Reflection:** Include scenes where he reflects on his defensive behavior, maybe with the help of other empathetic characters, to underline that it was not the right response and to illustrate his continued struggle with personal growth. - **Complexity of Emotions:** Portraying emotions as complex can lead to a more nuanced understanding. For example, his anger might stem from a sense of shame or a fear of not being the good person he aspires to be. Ultimately, showing a character's raw and imperfect response to confronting their own biases—followed by an honest attempt to address and change these reactions—can foster a narrative rich with character development and believable interactions. It makes the journey towards personal growth more genuine, reflecting the rocky path that real individuals often face."},{"prompt":"How impactful could it be, and how would both male and female viewers react, if despite all his struggles with bias and everything, he is still loved and cared for deeply by a female character that could be considered feministic?","completion":"Having a feminist female character who deeply cares for a male character struggling with bias can be quite impactful as it introduces a dynamic that, when executed sensitively, may resonate deeply with viewers. **For Female Viewers:** - **Empowerment:** Women may feel empowered seeing a feminist character who is strong in her convictions yet also capable of compassion and understanding. It can serve as an affirmation that one's feminist ideals need not preclude empathy and connection with those who are still learning. - **Validation of Complexity:** This relationship validates that real-life interactions between men and women, feminists included, are complex and not defined solely by ideology. It recognizes that people often have connections with others who do not fully align with their principles. - **Discussion of Feminism:** It can open up conversations about the spectrum of feminism and the different ways individuals can support and engage with feminist principles. **For Male Viewers:** - **Complex Alliance:** Men may appreciate seeing a representation of a feminist woman who allies with a man who is admittedly flawed but striving to do better. This can challenge the misperception that feminism is about male vilification rather than striving for equality. - **Personal Reflection:** Men might see the possibility for personal growth reflected in this relationship, recognizing that making mistakes doesn't make one irredeemable, and mutual respect and love can coexist with continued learning. - **Breaking Down Walls:** The relationship can help to dismantle barriers that some men may feel towards feminism by showing that feminist women can have loving, meaningful relationships with men, providing they acknowledge and work on their biases. **Impact of This Dynamic:** 1. **Humanizes Feminism**: It shows feminism as a humane, empathetic philosophy that advocates for equality while understanding that societal change is a process that involves growth and occasions for learning. 2. **Encourages Growth**: Viewers can find encouragement in seeing that personal development is recognized and supported, suggesting that striving to overcome one's biases can strengthen relationships rather than hinder them. 3. **Promotes Realistic Standards**: It presents a balanced view of feminism and provides a counter-narrative to the idea that feminists expect perfection from the opposite sex, promoting realistic standards and attainable goals. **Balanced Portrayal:** - **Avoid Idealization**: It's important not to idealize this relationship – challenges should be presented realistically. It should be evident that her love and care don't excuse his biases or make them any less harmful. - **Confront Biases**: The female character should challenge his biases when they arise, not in a way that is dismissive but that promotes growth and understanding. - **Demonstrate Independence**: The feminist character should be portrayed as a fully realized individual, independent of the male character's struggles. Her reasons for caring about him should be clear and multifaceted. The impact on viewers will largely depend on how authentically these characters and their relationship are portrayed. When viewers see that this dynamic is not an endorsement of his biases but rather a complex relationship that navigates ideological differences with love and mutual respect, they are more likely to understand and appreciate its depth. By showcasing both the trials and the triumphs in such a relationship, the narrative can become more compelling and allow for a richer audience experience across gender divides."},{"prompt":"how could the male character's anger and frustration be shown in a non toxic, even sympathetic light?","completion":"Portraying anger and frustration in a non-toxic and sympathetic light involves nuance and attention to the context in which these emotions are expressed, as well as their consequences. Here are some strategies to frame the male character's anger and frustration in a way that can elicit sympathy without condoning any potential toxicity: **1. Validating Emotions:** Acknowledge that anger and frustration are natural human responses to perceived threats or challenges. These emotions themselves are not toxic; it's how one acts on them that can be problematic. **2. Self-Awareness:** Show the character reflecting on his emotions. If he's aware that his frustration is unjustified or disproportionate, and he takes steps to manage his reaction responsibly, viewers can sympathize with his struggle. **3. Non-Harmful Expression:** Present the character's anger in ways that do not harm others—like taking a moment to breathe, going for a run, or channeling energy into a constructive task. This separation between feeling and acting toxically is crucial. **4. Impact on Relationships:** Highlight the reactions of those around him to provide a metric of his behavior's acceptability. When loved ones show concern rather than fear, it indicates his anger is not seen as threatening. **5. Consequences and Accountability:** Even sympathetic portrayals should involve the character facing consequences when his emotions lead to poor decisions. This demonstrates that while his feelings are understandable, they do not excuse harmful actions. **6. Seeking Understanding:** Have him actively try to understand the source of his frustration or anger. Is it embarrassment, feeling misunderstood, or something else? Delving into the causes can generate sympathy and show a desire for personal growth. **7. Backstory and Context:** Providing context for his emotional reactions can deepen viewers' understanding. Perhaps he has a past that explains his sensitivity to certain triggers, making his reactions more comprehensible. **8. Open Communication:** Scenes where the character communicates his emotions openly—\\"I get frustrated when I feel like I'm not being heard\\"—can help to establish his intent and create empathy. **9. Non-Aggressive Vulnerability:** Allow him to express vulnerability associated with his anger. Confiding in others that he is trying hard to change but finds it difficult can evoke sympathy. **10. Framing and Contrast:** Use narrative framing to contrast his struggles with other characters who express anger toxically and without regret. This contrast can highlight his relative decency and complexity. **11. Support and Encouragement:** Incorporate other characters who supportively acknowledge his efforts, which can help humanize him to the audience and show that progress is valued, even if it's slow. **12. Resolution and Change:** Offer moments of resolution where he overcomes his initial impulse to react negatively, showcasing his capacity to rein in his emotions and respond more constructively. By portraying the character's emotions with realism and dimensionality, you can create a figure who is struggling with the very human problem of how to handle intense feelings in difficult situations. When such a portrayal includes efforts toward personal growth and non-toxic outlets for emotions, viewers are more likely to empathize with his journey and recognize the complexity of his character."},{"prompt":"could it be nuanced if a lot of the male characters actually have understandable reasons for being bias against women?","completion":"Navigating the portrayal of male characters with biases against women can be controversial and requires careful and nuanced handling. The real-world implications of bias, discrimination, and sexism are serious and have far-reaching consequences. Even when a narrative offers characters with understandable reasons for their biases, it's vital to provide a clear ethical standpoint that these biases are not justified, but rather a reflection of larger societal issues. Consider the following points in your portrayal: 1. **Historical or Societal Context:** Biases often stem from cultural, societal, or historical contexts. You can explore these roots to explain where their biases might have originated without condoning them. 2. **Personal Backstories:** Characters might have personal experiences that contribute to their worldview. While these may explain their biases, they should not excuse them. Their backstories can provide insight into their mindset and open the door for potential growth and change. 3. **Flawed Logic:** Demonstrating that their reasoning is based on flawed stereotypes or misinformation can be a learning point in the story. This can show that while their feelings and experiences are valid, the conclusions they’ve drawn from them are not. 4. **Character Journey:** By using their biases as a starting point for a character's personal journey, you can create a narrative about unlearning prejudice. This can be a powerful way to address the biases head-on and explore themes of personal development and redemption. 5. **Counter Perspectives:** Introduce characters who contrast these biases, offering different viewpoints or challenging assumptions. This helps to avoid unintentionally validating the biases and underscores their complexity. 6. **Consequences of Bias:** Show the real consequences of bias on the women who are affected by it. This emphasizes the harmful impact of biases and pushes the narrative beyond simply understanding why the biases exist. 7. **No Easy Answers:** Avoid overly simplistic resolutions where biases are quickly and effortlessly overcome following a single enlightening conversation or event. Instead, convey the gradual, painstaking process of unlearning ingrained beliefs. 8. **Dialogue and Education:** Create moments of meaningful dialogue that challenge these biases and push the characters to reflect more deeply on their attitudes and actions. 9. **Multiple Viewpoints:** Ensure that the narrative doesn't become one-sided by presenting only the perspectives of those with biases. Offer a balanced portrayal by giving voice to the experiences and perspectives of female characters as they navigate these biases. 10. **Ethical Standpoint:** The narrative as a whole should take an ethical stance against sexism and discrimination. While characters might be shown struggling with their biases, the story should not condone or apologize for sexism. A nuanced portrayal means exploring the origins and impacts of bias while also advocating for the growth and education necessary to overcome it. By doing so thoughtfully, a story can spark empathy and understanding, recognize the realities and inherent wrong of such biases, and contribute to the broader conversation about equality and respect."},{"prompt":"could Woman viewers be okay with men acting in certain ways as long as the Female characters are allowed to be the same way?","completion":"As with any audience, women viewers have diverse preferences and perspectives, so there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, the key to creating a narrative that resonates with a wide audience often lies in crafting a story that's fair and balanced. When female characters are provided with the same depth, complexity, and range of behavior as male characters, women viewers may be more receptive to the story as a whole, even if some characters exhibit challenging or negative behavior. Here are a few reasons why: **Equality of Agency:** Allowing female characters the same level of agency and complexity as male characters communicates that both genders are equally capable of a full range of actions, emotions, and decisions. This equality in portrayal can alleviate concerns over double standards. **Diverse Representation:** When both male and female characters are shown with an array of traits, from positive to negative, it reflects the reality that all individuals have virtues and flaws. This multifaceted representation can be engaging and validating. **Consistency in Consequences:** A narrative that applies consistent consequences to actions, regardless of the character's gender, tends to be respected. If male and female characters are equally held accountable for their behavior, the story maintains a sense of fairness and justice. **Narrative Balance:** When a story includes characters of both genders displaying a particular trait or behavior, and that trait is treated as a human quality rather than a gender-specific one, it creates a balanced perspective within the narrative. **Relatability:** Women viewers, like all viewers, want to see characters they can relate to. When female characters are allowed the same freedoms and complexities as males—including the freedom to make mistakes, be bold, or show strength—the story becomes more inclusive and engaging. That being said, it's important to approach character creation thoughtfully. Consider the following to ensure your story resonates well: 1. **Avoid Stereotyping:** Characters should transcend gender-based stereotypes. Even if a character's actions conform to traditional gender roles, their motivations and the context should be individualized and nuanced. 2. **Empathetic Portrayal:** Characters, regardless of gender, should be portrayed with empathy. Understanding their motivations and backgrounds can make even morally complex characters engaging. 3. **Challenge and Growth:** Both male and female characters should face challenges that spur character development. By showcasing personal growth, the narrative affirms that change is possible for everyone. It's important to remember that storytelling inherently carries subjective responses; what one viewer finds acceptable or entertaining, another may not. The overarching goal is to create a story that feels genuine, nuanced, and equitable in its presentation of all characters. When done well, this approach can lead to broader appeal and foster a more inclusive storytelling environment."},{"prompt":"how could the overcoming biases be done in a way that doesn't show that men would have to become overly agreeable with women, or never saying no to them?","completion":"Overcoming biases doesn't necessitate that men, or anyone for that matter, become overly agreeable or never say no to the opposite gender. Instead, it's about developing a more informed, respectful, and empathetic approach to interpersonal relationships. Here's how writers can illustrate characters overcoming biases without implying that agreement or acquiescence is required: **1. Foster Mutual Respect:** Emphasize the importance of mutual respect in character interactions. Men and women can have differing opinions or refuse requests while still valuing each other's perspectives. **2. Encourage Healthy Boundaries:** Characters should maintain healthy boundaries and assert their needs or dissent in a respectful manner. Overcoming biases includes recognizing and valuing the autonomy of others, regardless of gender. **3. Model Constructive Communication:** Demonstrate how characters can disagree or say no through constructive communication, thereby maintaining integrity without succumbing to aggressive or dismissive behavior. **4. Highlight Active Listening:** Depict characters actively listening to each other. Even if they end up disagreeing, the key is that they consider the other’s viewpoint sincerely before responding. **5. Show Responsibility for Actions and Words:** Teach male characters to recognize the impact of their actions and language without adopting a stance of unwarranted agreement. Being considerate doesn't mean always saying yes, but rather being thoughtful about one's responses. **6. Avoid Pedestalization:** Ensure that the narrative doesn't pedestal women as beings who are always right and must be agreed with. Characters of all genders should be shown as fallible and capable of making mistakes. **7. Celebrate Diversity in Thought:** Portray diversity of thought as a strength within the story. By having characters with differing opinions who can collaborate and learn from each other, the story acknowledges that overcoming biases is about inclusion, not uniformity. **8. Reflect Equality in Relationships:** Develop relationships in the story that reflect equality. Here, decision-making and the ability to express dissent are shared and reciprocated without an imbalance of power. **9. Portray Personal Growth:** Character growth should involve recognizing and unlearning biases, not just in relation to the opposite gender but as part of their individual development. This includes understanding the importance of consent and agency. **10. Focus on Empathy:** Cultivating empathy should be a priority for characters working on their biases, helping them to respond to others with understanding rather than default agreement. **11. Balanced Decision Making:** Show characters collaboratively coming to decisions. This reinforces the idea that healthy relationships, both professional and personal, involve negotiation and mutual respect. **12. Distinguish Characters:** Each character should be distinct in how they process and overcome biases, reflecting the diversity of human experiences and the various ways individuals evolve. By following these approaches, writers can craft stories that navigate the complexities of overcoming biases in a multidimensional way. The focus remains on growing into individuals who respect and value others as equals, rather than simply conforming or acquiescing to one another's demands or viewpoints. This nuanced approach can inspire readers or viewers to reflect on their own behaviour and biases, fostering greater understanding and respect in their interactions."},{"prompt":"how would male viewers and female viewers react to female characters discussing sexism in a multitude of ways, not just in anger or smarmily?","completion":"Exploring the topic of sexism through multi-dimensional female characters who discuss their experiences in various ways can provide a more relatable, nuanced, and informative narrative. Since individuals process and communicate their encounters with discrimination differently, a diverse approach can resonate with a broader audience. Here's how male and female viewers might react to this diversified portrayal: **Male Viewers:** - **Increased Understanding**: By listening to female characters articulate their experiences with sexism without default anger or condescension, male viewers may find it easier to empathize and understand their perspectives. - **Less Defensiveness**: Presenting these conversations in a non-accusatory manner can prevent male viewers from feeling implicated or becoming defensive, which can create a more open and engaging viewing experience. - **Greater Awareness**: The variety of discussions around sexism can illuminate the many forms it takes, potentially increasing male viewers' awareness of behaviors and societal patterns they may not have previously recognized as problematic. **Female Viewers:** - **Validation of Feelings**: Female viewers may feel their own range of emotions and responses to sexism are validated when they see characters responding in ways other than anger or sarcasm. This diversity allows for a more authentic connection to the characters and their experiences. - **Recognition of Complexity**: By showcasing different reactions and coping mechanisms, these portrayals acknowledge the complexity of confronting sexism, which may resonate with female viewers who have navigated these struggles themselves. - **Strength in Vulnerability**: Female characters discussing sexism with vulnerability, humor, determination, or a combination thereof can offer a powerful representation of strength, potentially inspiring female viewers. **Impactful Representation of Conversations**: 1. **With Empathy and Support**: Portraying discussions where characters listen to each other and offer support can create a sense of solidarity among viewers. 2. **Through Personal Stories**: Using personal anecdotes and stories rather than generalizations can allow for a deeper understanding of sexist experiences on an individual level. 3. **In Casual and Serious Contexts**: Discussions about sexism can occur in various contexts, from casual conversations to more serious debates or consultations, mirroring real-life dynamics. 4. **Across a Spectrum of Emotion**: Characters can express a range of emotions, from frustration and sadness to determination and hopefulness, reflecting the multifaceted nature of these discussions. 5. **With Humor and Satire**: Injecting humor or satire into the conversation can serve as a coping mechanism for characters and make the subject matter more approachable for viewers. 6. **Within Diverse Settings**: Characters might tackle the subject in different settings—workplace, social gatherings, family environments—offering multiple lenses through which to view the issue. 7. **Educational Moments**: Including moments where characters share educational insights about sexism, perhaps dispelling myths or highlighting lesser-known facts, can serve to inform viewers. 8. **With Intersectionality**: Recognizing that sexism intersects with other forms of discrimination (e.g., racism, classism, ableism) can add layers to the conversation and address the varied experiences of different women. Individuals have varied tastes and thresholds for topics like sexism, and while some male or female viewers may find certain conversations difficult regardless of how they're framed, the multifaceted portrayal increases the likelihood that the narrative will reach and impact a diverse audience. By including multiple voices and approaches to discuss sexism, a story can engage a wider viewership, facilitating empathy and a deeper understanding of complex social issues."},{"prompt":"speaking of how anyone could be a hero or villain, how could a Villainess that acts all 'girlboss' with men she knows won't fight back, yet acts all 'ladylike' around men she feels threatened by, be written well?","completion":"Writing a nuanced villainess character who adopts a \\"girlboss\\" persona around men she perceives as non-threatening, and a \\"ladylike\\" demeanor around those she feels intimidated by, can be achieved by focusing on the complexity of her motivations, her adaptability, and the deeper layers of her personality. Here are some tips for crafting such a character: **1. Explore Motivations**: Offer insight into why she adopts these facades. Is it a learned survival mechanism, a strategy to gain power, or a reflection of her own insecurities? Understanding her motivations will make her actions more coherent and give the audience a clearer view of her internal landscape. **2. Show Versatility**: Demonstrate her ability to adapt to different social situations. This adaptability can be a testament to her intelligence and strategic thinking, even if her actions are ultimately self-serving or morally questionable. **3. Provide Context**: Provide context for her behavior by exploring her backgrounds, such as her upbringing, past experiences, or significant events that shaped her understanding of power dynamics and gender roles. **4. Humanize Her**: Give her vulnerabilities and moments of genuine emotion to create a multi-dimensional character. Even as a villainess, she may have moments that humanize her, making her more than a mere archetype. **5. Contrast Public and Private Personas**: Show the disparity between how she presents herself in different contexts, and who she is when she's alone or with trusted confidants. This can add depth to her character and prompt the audience to consider the cost of her duplicity. **6. Dynamic Interactions**: Use her interactions with male characters to reveal different facets of her character. How she treats various men can help to illustrate her adaptability, intelligence, and underlying beliefs. **7. Acknowledge Consequences**: No character operates in a vacuum. Show the consequences of her actions, both on her own life and the lives of others, to emphasize that her behavior is not without impact. **8. Subtle Power Plays**: Rather than overt villainy, her ability to manipulate situations and people with subtlety can make her a more frightening and realistic antagonist, demonstrating a keen understanding of social dynamics. **9. Avoid Clichés**: Steer clear of clichéd or overdone tropes about female villains. Strive for originality in her character development and avoid reducing her to simplistic stereotypes. **10. Reactions and Relationships**: Through the reactions of other characters to her behavior, you can add further insight into her methods and effectiveness. How do others perceive and respond to her dual personas? **11. Gradual Revelation**: Let her true nature and intentions unfold gradually throughout the narrative, keeping the audience engaged and adding a sense of mystery to her character. **12. Complex Relationships**: Craft relationships that defy easy categorization. Perhaps she forms genuine connections despite her manipulative tendencies, or maybe she feels remorse over certain manipulations. By paying attention to these nuances, you can create a villainess who embodies the complexities of character that make for compelling storytelling. Her manipulation of gender performance can serve not only to advance her goals but also to comment on society's expectations of women and the ways they leverage these to their advantage. The result is a character that captures the audience's fascination and adds a rich layer to the conversation about power and gender dynamics."},{"prompt":"could the existence of such women also make the male characters' attempts to fight bias and be decent, be more challenging?","completion":"Absolutely, the existence of a complex female antagonist who manipulates traditional gender roles for her own gain can present a unique challenge for male characters who are attempting to overcome biases and behave decently. This subplot can add depth to the story by highlighting the difficulties that arise when confronting one's own prejudices, especially in the face of calculated manipulation. Here is how such a dynamic can be effectively portrayed: 1. **Moral Ambiguity:** Male characters may struggle to navigate their interactions with a manipulative female character without reverting to or reinforcing their own biases. Viewers can see them grapple with how to respond fairly to someone who doesn't play by the rules. 2. **Self-Reflection:** The male characters’ encounters with the villainess can provoke internal reflection and debate about their own attitudes and beliefs. Are they treating her differently because of her gender, or because of her actions? 3. **Social Conditioning:** The male characters may realize that societal conditioning and gender stereotypes influence their responses to the villainess, forcing them to confront these conditioned responses and thoughtfully reassess them. 4. **Challenging Assumptions:** Characters who want to be decent may find themselves having to challenge not only societal assumptions about women but also their personal prejudices in order to respond appropriately to her actions. 5. **Need for Discernment:** The presence of a manipulative character emphasizes the need for discernment. Male characters striving to be decent must learn to differentiate between general bias and individual character judgment. 6. **Confronting Double Standards:** Male characters can be put in situations where they have to confront double standards within themselves or within their social group, such as holding the villainess to different standards than they would a villain. 7. **Influencing Peer Perception:** The male characters must balance peer perception with their own revised values. They may feel pressure to react in a way that’s congruent with their peer group while internally disagreeing with that response. 8. **Opportunities for Growth:** These difficult situations present opportunities for growth. Male characters can evolve to become more thoughtful and measured in their approach to gender dynamics and individual relationships. By showcasing the tension between the male characters' commitment to overcoming biases and their reactions to being manipulated, the story underscores that the path to becoming better is fraught with obstacles, particularly in a complex world where others may exploit vulnerabilities for their advantage. Moreover, it can serve as a commentary on the importance of perseverance and integrity in the struggle for personal improvement and equity, providing a richer narrative experience."},{"prompt":"so how could she be 'defeated'?","completion":"Defeating a complex female antagonist—like a villainess who strategically oscillates between a \\"girlboss\\" and \\"ladylike\\" demeanor—usually doesn’t rely on physical confrontation but rather on intellectual, emotional, or moral outmaneuvering. Here's how such a character's eventual downfall could be crafted, bearing in mind that \\"defeat\\" can take various forms aside from a traditional vanquishment: **1. Exposed Manipulation:** Her manipulation could be exposed either publicly or within her circle, leading to a loss of trust and influence. Once her tactics are revealed, she loses her power to sway and control others. **2. Outsmarted:** Another character, who is wise to her games, might outwit her. This could involve predicting her moves and countering them, or maneuvering her into a position where she can no longer manipulate the situation without exposing her true nature. **3. A Crisis of Conscience:** The villainess might experience a crisis of conscience, brought about by an understanding of the harm she’s caused. This personal revelation might spur her to undo some of her wrongdoings, effectively 'defeating' her darker impulses. **4. Solidarity Among Characters:** The characters she’s manipulated might band together, forming a united front against her. Their solidarity could neutralize her divide-and-conquer strategy and undermine the power her manipulation once held. **5. Personal Overreaching:** Her downfall could result from becoming overconfident and pushing her manipulative strategies too far. She might take a risk that backfires, resulting in her losing her grip on power. **6. Internal Conflict:** Internal divisions within her own ranks (e.g., disloyalty from those closest to her or the emergence of a rival) could lead to her undoing, revealing that manipulation isn’t a sustainable long-term strategy. **7. Retribution:** If she’s committed illegal or unethical acts, she might be brought to justice by the legal system or an ethical oversight entity, showing that actions have consequences. **8. Self-Destruction:** A character that flourishes on manipulation and deceit might eventually be undone by her own traits. As she becomes caught in her web of lies, her empire collapses from within. **9. Becoming Obsolete:** Her tactics might become less effective as society evolves and her machinations are seen as outdated, diminishing her influence and power. **10. Empowerment of Others:** Her victims might find strength and reclaim their agency, reducing her power over them. This empowerment could come from individual growth or from the support of a community that the protagonist has helped to nurture. **11. Redemption Arc:** In some narratives, a villainess could undergo a transformation, becoming an ally or a reformed character. Her 'defeat' is then a transition into a more positive role within the story. It's important to note that the ultimate resolution needs to align with the story’s themes and character arcs. If the narrative has focused heavily on the complexities of gender dynamics and the overcoming of biases, her defeat should serve as a culmination of those ideas rather than a simplistic retribution. A well-crafted downfall can be an opportunity to reinforce or challenge the story’s central themes, providing a satisfying resolution that resonates with the audience."},{"prompt":"Parameter untuk pengujian air secara kimia, paling tepat adalah dengan melakukan pengamatan terhadap...A.PH, kejernihan dan kandungan partikel padatB.kandungan zat kimiawi, padatan tersuspensi dan terlarutC.BOD, COD dan DOD.bau, warna dan suhuE.kandungan bakteri dan mikroorganisme yang ada dalam air","completion":"Pengujian air secara kimia biasanya difokuskan pada identifikasi dan kuantifikasi zat-zat kimiawi yang terlarut atau tersuspensi dalam air.

Let's define and differentiate between these statistical terms: 1. Confidence Interval (CI): A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter. Confidence intervals are associated with a level of confidence, usually expressed as a percentage (such as 95% or 99%). This percentage reflects the frequency with which the interval, calculated from repeated random sampling, would contain the parameter. However, it does not provide a probability for a specific interval. Example: If we have a sample mean of 100 and the 95% confidence interval for the population mean is (95, 105), it means that if we were to take many random samples from the population and compute a 95% CI for each sample, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean. 2. Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Interval: The HPD interval is a concept from Bayesian statistics. It is the interval that contains a given portion of the posterior distribution (e.g., 95%) and where no point inside the interval has a lower probability density than any point outside the interval. The HPD interval is the shortest interval for a given coverage probability. Example: If a Bayesian analysis of a posterior distribution for a parameter θ results in a 95% HPD interval of (50, 60), this means that the interval (50, 60) encompasses 95% of the posterior probability and every point within this range has a higher probability density than points outside the range. 3. Confidence Bend: This term is not standard in statistical terminology. It may be a confusion with confidence band or confidence belt, which refers to a graphical representation displaying the upper and lower confidence intervals across a range of values for an estimated function, such as a regression line. Example: A confidence band around a regression line on a scatter plot illustrates the range within which we can be confident that the true regression line exists for different values of the independent variable. 4. Coverage Probability: Coverage probability is the proportion of times that a statistical procedure will generate intervals that include the true parameter value. It is related to the reliability of the procedure in frequentist terms. The nominal coverage probability is the target level (e.g., 95%), while the actual coverage probability may sometimes differ due to the sample size, distributional assumptions, or method used to construct the intervals. Example: If we construct 95% confidence intervals for the mean from many samples, and the actual proportion of these intervals that include the true population mean is 94%, the coverage probability is 94%. To summarize: - A confidence interval provides a range where we expect the true population parameter to lie with a specified level of confidence. - An HPD interval provides the shortest range that contains a certain amount of the posterior probability and respects the posterior distribution's shape. - A confidence band or bend (if this is what was intended) shows a range of confidence intervals for the predicted values over the scope of an independent variable. - Coverage probability is the actual proportion of times a confidence interval would include the true parameter if the procedure was repeated over many samples."},{"prompt":"Higher probability density","completion":"The term \\"higher probability density\\" typically is used in the context of probability density functions (PDFs) in statistics, particularly within Bayesian inference when discussing the Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval. Probability Density Function (PDF): When dealing with continuous random variables, the probability density function represents the likelihood of a random variable taking on a particular value. For any given point on the x-axis, the value of the PDF at that point represents the relative likelihood of the random variable being near that x value. It is \\"relative\\" because, in continuous distributions, the probability of the variable taking on any exact value is technically zero; we consider probabilities over intervals instead. Higher Probability Density: In the context of a PDF, a \\"higher\\" probability density means a greater likelihood relative to other values. The peaks of the PDF correspond to areas with higher probability density, indicating that the random variable is more likely to be observed in the vicinity of those values. Within Bayesian statistics, probability density is used to describe the posterior distribution, representing the updated beliefs about a parameter after incorporating prior knowledge and observed data. Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Interval: As mentioned earlier, the HPD interval is a Bayesian interval estimate for a parameter. The HPD interval is the range where the probability density is highest, meaning that it encapsulates the most plausible values of the parameter, given the data. If you were to create a credible interval (analogous to a confidence interval in frequentist statistics) based on a posterior distribution, the HPD would be the narrowest such interval encompassing a given total probability mass (like 95%). For example, imagine you have a posterior distribution for a parameter that is bell-shaped (like a normal distribution). The HPD interval might be the region around the mode (the peak) of the distribution encompassing 95% of the area under the curve. Every point within the HPD interval has a higher probability density than points outside it, which means that parameter values inside this interval are more credible (or more supported by the data) than values outside it. Thus, when we say the HPD interval contains “higher probability density,” we mean that within this range, the observed data and prior information most strongly support the values of the parameter in question."},{"prompt":"Highest probability distribution","completion":"The term \\"highest probability distribution\\" is not standard statistical terminology. It might be a misnomer or confusion with other statistical concepts. However, in a Bayesian context or when discussing probability distributions generally, you might be referring to one of a few things: 1. Highest Probability Density (HPD) Interval: As previously explained, an HPD interval is the range of values on the domain of a probability distribution with the highest density such that a given percentage of the distribution lies within this interval. It represents the most credible values for a parameter, given the observed data and prior information. 2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): This is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model. The estimated parameters are the ones that maximize the likelihood function, or equivalently, when dealing with probability densities, the ones that make the observed data most probable. 3. Most Probable Value: In a given probability distribution, the most probable value is the mode, which is the value where the probability density or mass function reaches its maximum. If you intended \\"highest probability distribution\\" to imply that a certain distribution has higher probability relative to other distributions, it might be necessary to clarify in what context this comparison is made. In Bayesian model comparison, for example, one could argue that a model (with its accompanying distribution) has the highest probability in light of the data by comparing posterior probabilities of models. Without additional context, \\"highest probability distribution\\" remains ambiguous. If you have a specific scenario or application in mind, please provide additional details for a more targeted explanation."},{"prompt":"True population parameter","completion":"The term \\"true population parameter\\" in statistics refers to the actual, but typically unknown, numerical value that accurately reflects a characteristic of an entire population. A population parameter is a numerical value that summarizes a certain aspect of the population, such as its mean, variance, proportion, or standard deviation. Because it is often impractical or impossible to observe every member of a population to directly calculate the true parameter, statisticians use estimates based on samples drawn from the population. These estimators aim to infer the value of the population parameter through calculation from sample data, and different statistical methods exist for providing such estimates (e.g., point estimates and interval estimates). Some commonly discussed population parameters include: - **Mean (μ)**: The average value of a numerical characteristic across the entire population. For example, the average height of all adults in a country. - **Proportion (p)**: The ratio of the population that has a particular characteristic. For example, the proportion of voters in a nation who support a particular policy. - **Variance (σ²)**: A measure of the dispersion or spread of the values of a characteristic within a population. For example, the variance in income levels within a demographic group. - **Standard Deviation (σ)**: The square root of the population variance, reflecting the average distance of the population values from the mean. - **Median**: The middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the population. To better understand the concept of a \\"true\\" population parameter, consider the following example: If you want to determine the average height of adult women in the United States, the true population parameter would be the exact average height if you could measure every adult woman in the country. Since that's not viable, we take a sample of adult women, measure their heights, and calculate the sample mean. This sample mean is an estimator for the unknown true population mean (the parameter of interest). In frequentist statistics, the true population parameter is considered to be a fixed but unknown value that does not vary. It is the goal of statistical inference to estimate this parameter with certain levels of confidence and precision. In contrast, Bayesian statistics treats the parameter as a random variable, and the goal is to identify the range of credible values for it given prior knowledge and observed data."},{"prompt":"Manusia yang mengkonsumsi ikan yang tercemar merkuri dari kegiatan penambangan emas akan mengalami gangguan penyakit.....A.scabesB.hepatitisC.sesak nafasD.kanker kulitE.minamataJawabannya adalah","completion":"E.

Ключевые причины, по которым необходим сервер для Drupal: 1. **Хостинг контента и компонентов сайта**: Сервер предоставляет хранение для всех файлов сайта, включая темы оформления, модули, мультимедийный контент и пользовательские файлы. 2. **Обработка HTTP-запросов**: Посетители сайта отправляют HTTP-запросы к серверу, который обрабатывает эти запросы и отправляет соответствующие HTTP-ответы (веб-страницы, изображения, стили и т.д.). 3. **Выполнение PHP скриптов**: Drupal написан на языке программирования PHP, поэтому сервер должен поддерживать выполнение PHP для обработки логики веб-сайта. 4. **Управление базой данных**: Drupal требует систему управления базами данных (например, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), которая работает на сервере и управляет данными веб-сайта, такими как контент, пользовательские данные, настройки сайта и т.д. 5. **Масштабируемость и производительность**: Сервер позволяет сайту поддерживать возрастающую нагрузку путем масштабирования ресурсов или распределения нагрузки на несколько серверов. 6. **Защита и безопасность**: Надежный сервер обеспечивает безопасность сайта на Drupal с помощью обновлений безопасности, брандмауэра, системы обнаружения вторжений и других мер безопасности. 7. **Автоматизация резервного копирования и обновлений**: Сервер позволяет настроить автоматические резервные копии и обновления для сайта, что снижает риски потери данных и защищает от уязвимостей. 8. **Поддержка сторонних интеграций**: Сайты на Drupal часто интегрируются со сторонними сервисами и приложениями, для чего может потребоваться специфическая серверная поддержка. В настоящее время для размещения сайтов на Drupal часто используются виртуальные серверы (VPS), облачные серверы или специализированные серверные решения от провайдеров веб-хостинга, предоставляющие уже настроенные и оптимизированные для работы с Drupal решения. Они выступают в качестве фундамента для работы сайта, предоставляя всевозможные серверные ресурсы и службы, которые нужны для надежной и бесперебойной работы веб-приложения на базе Drupal."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art book and coffee","completion":"Inspirational Sunrise | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | \\"Book and Coffee\\" Theme | Unique Home & Apparel Decor"},{"prompt":"Penggunaan pupuk bertujuan untuk menyuburkan tanaman, namun penggunaan yang berlebihan mengakibatkan sisa pupuk tercuci oleh air hujan, masuk ke saluran irigasi kemudian terkumpul di sungai.

These techniques are related but serve different purposes in statistical analysis: 1. Hypothesis Testing (Testing): Hypothesis testing is a method used to make decisions about a population parameter (such as the mean or proportion) based on sample data. In hypothesis testing, we start with a null hypothesis (H0) that represents a status quo or a benchmark (e.g., the mean is equal to some specified value) and an alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha) that represents some kind of change or difference (e.g., the mean is not equal to that value). The objective of hypothesis testing is to determine whether the sample data provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. To do this, we calculate a test statistic from the sample data and determine the probability of observing such a statistic (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true (this probability is the p-value). If the p-value is less than a predetermined significance level (α, often 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence supporting the alternative hypothesis. 2. Interval Estimation (Confidence Intervals): Interval estimation, on the other hand, is concerned with estimating the value of an unknown population parameter by providing a range of plausible values, known as a confidence interval (CI). This interval is calculated from sample data and has an associated confidence level, which is the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter. Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%. A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data. When we say that we are 95% confident that the true parameter value lies within the confidence interval, we mean that if we were to take many samples and build confidence intervals from each of them, about 95% of these intervals would contain the true parameter value. Relationship between Testing and Interval Estimation: The relationship between hypothesis testing and interval estimation is quite close in that they both use sample data to infer something about the population parameter and are based on the same underlying statistical principles. If you perform a hypothesis test at a certain significance level (e.g., α = 0.05), there is a direct connection to the confidence interval at the corresponding confidence level (e.g., 95% CI): - If a confidence interval does not contain the value of the parameter specified under the null hypothesis, then a hypothesis test at the related significance level would reject the null hypothesis. - Conversely, if the confidence interval does contain the value of the parameter under the null hypothesis, then a hypothesis test at the related significance level would fail to reject the null. Both methods utilize the sampling distribution of the test statistic and depend on the central limit theorem for their validity. They provide different but complementary views of the same inferential problem. Hypothesis testing gives a binary decision (reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis), while interval estimation provides a range of values that are consistent with the sample data and reflects the uncertainty of the estimate."},{"prompt":"Generate a random sample from some binomial population and point 95% confidence interval, HPD interval, confidence band and for this sample and calculate the coverage probability for each of them","completion":"To generate a random sample from a binomial population and compute the different kinds of intervals, we need to use a statistical software package, such as R or Python. Here I will use a Python-like pseudocode to illustrate how you would do this, but keep in mind that this is a conceptual example and should be run in a proper Python environment with the necessary libraries installed. We'll generate a single random binomial sample, calculate the different intervals, and discuss the concept of coverage probability. \`\`\`python import numpy as np import scipy.stats as stats # Define binomial distribution parameters n_trials = 10 # number of trials p_success = 0.5 # probability of success sample_size = 100 # size of the sample # Generate a random sample from the binomial population np.random.seed(42) # set seed for reproducibility sample = np.random.binomial(n=n_trials, p=p_success, size=sample_size) # Point estimate of the success probability (p_hat) p_hat = np.mean(sample) / n_trials # Standard error for binomial proportion se = np.sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / (sample_size * n_trials)) # Calculate 95% confidence interval for the binomial proportion z_score = stats.norm.ppf(0.975) # Z-score for 95% confidence confidence_interval = (p_hat - z_score * se, p_hat + z_score * se) # Calculate the 95% HPD (Highest Posterior Density) interval # Note: HPD is more commonly used with Bayesian methods and is not typically calculated for a binomial distribution in frequentist statistics. # For discrete distributions like the binomial, we don't normally compute an HPD interval directly. Instead, we could use a Bayesian approach with a Beta prior to determine the credible interval, which would be conceptually similar to the HPD. # Calculate the 95% confidence band # Confidence bands are more often associated with regression analysis and are not typically computed for a single binomial proportion. # Calculate the coverage probability for each interval # Coverage probability requires simulating many samples and checking if the true parameter (p_success) lies within the computed intervals. # Simulating this many times would give us empirical coverage probabilities for each type of interval # This is typically done as a simulation study with a large number of replications, not just a single sample # Since we only have a single sample, we can only determine if the true parameter is within the computed intervals this one time, not the coverage probability. # However, for illustrative purposes, let's check if the true parameter is in the confidence interval coverage_cip = 1 if (confidence_interval[0] <= p_success <= confidence_interval[1]) else 0 # Print results print(f\\"Sample proportion: {p_hat}\\") print(f\\"95% Confidence interval: {confidence_interval}\\") print(f\\"Coverage probability for the CI (not accurate, needs more replications): {coverage_cip}\\") # Note: HPD interval and confidence band calculations are not included as they are beyond the scope of simple frequentist binomial estimation and would typically involve Bayesian analysis or regression, respectively. \`\`\` In practice, to calculate the coverage probability, you would need to repeat the sampling and interval computations thousands of times to see how often the true parameter value falls within the intervals. The coverage probability is then estimated as the proportion of intervals that contain the true parameter. One way to get an empirical estimate of the coverage probability is demonstrated with the \`coverage_cip\` variable. In a full simulation, you would repeat the steps within a loop and count the number of times the true parameter (\`p_success\`) is within the intervals. Do note that our pseudocode only calculates a frequentist confidence interval for the proportion and checks a single instance of coverage for illustrative purposes. The HPD interval and confidence band calculation would require a more expansive setup, usually in the context of Bayesian statistics and regression models, respectively. These topics, while related, are specialized and go beyond the basics of interval estimation around binomial proportions."},{"prompt":"Salah satu upaya untuk menurunkan emisi gas rumah kaca sebagai penyebab terjadinya pencemaran lingkungan adalah...A.membentuk Protokol KyotoB.setiap negara tidak diperbolehkan menggunakan bahan bakar fosilC.membatasi ekspor atau import batu macanD.melagerakan menanam pohon antar negaraE.PBB membatasi pembangunan gedung bertingkat di setiap negara","completion":"Upaya untuk menurunkan emisi gas rumah kaca sebagai penyebab terjadinya pencemaran lingkungan pada pilihan yang tersedia adalah: A. membentuk Protokol Kyoto Protokol Kyoto adalah kesepakatan internasional yang ditujukan untuk mengurangi emisi gas rumah kaca.

Differences between constitutional and nonconstitutional governments, and examples of different types of governments:** **(a) Differences between constitutional and nonconstitutional governments:** - **Constitutional Government:** - A constitutional government is bound by a formal constitution, which defines the powers of the government and the rights of the governed. It provides a legal framework for political processes. - Typically includes a clear separation of powers among the branches of government, such as the executive, legislative, and judiciary. - Often ensures the protection of individual rights and liberties through a bill of rights or similar document. - Can be a democracy, republic, constitutional monarchy, etc., where the power is limited by the constitution. - Is usually characterized by the rule of law, where laws apply equally to all citizens, including government officials. - **Nonconstitutional Government:** - A nonconstitutional government is not bound by a formal constitution, and there may be no clear limits to the powers held by the ruling entities. - Often characterized by arbitrary rule where decisions can be made by the ruler(s) without legal constraint. - May not guarantee the protection of individual rights. - Can take the form of an absolute monarchy, oligarchy, dictatorship, etc., where power is concentrated in the hands of one or a few and not necessarily accountable to the people. - The rule of law may be absent or inconsistently applied, with power often resting in the hands of the governing authority. **(b) Five different types of governments currently in power in the world:** 1. **Parliamentary Democracy** - For example, the United Kingdom. The government is elected by the parliament, and the head of state can be different from the head of government. 2. **Presidential Republic** - Such as the United States. A system in which the president is both the head of state and the government and is elected separately from the legislative body. 3. **Absolute Monarchy** - For example, Saudi Arabia. A system where a monarch has complete and unrestricted power, typically without a formal constitution. 4. **Constitutional Monarchy** - Seen in countries like Japan and Sweden. The monarch is a ceremonial figurehead while the government is elected and bound by a constitution. 5. **One-Party State** - Examples include the People's Republic of China. A single party controls the government, and other parties may be banned or limited. **(c) Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I cannot directly display world maps. To identify countries with each of these forms of government, you would need to reference a world political map or use a digital service like Google Maps or an educational platform that provides such resources. Look for each country identified and their respective government types on the map.** **6. Representation of governments abroad and the roles of various entities in foreign relations:** **(a) How a government is represented abroad and U.S. accreditation to international organizations:** - Governments are represented abroad through embassies, consulates, and permanent missions to international organizations. - Embassies are the main offices in a foreign country's capital, headed by an ambassador, and handle diplomatic relations and major issues. - Consulates are located in major cities outside the capital, providing services to citizens and facilitating trade and communication. - Permanent missions are offices dedicated to representing their country at international organizations like the United Nations. - Accreditation to international organizations entails the official recognition and acceptance of diplomats and delegates by the organization to represent their country. **(b) Roles in the conduct of foreign relations:** - **Ambassador:** The highest-ranking diplomatic representative sent by one sovereign state to another. The ambassador is responsible for managing the embassy and its duties, including diplomatic communication and representation. - **Consul:** A government official residing in a foreign city who assists and protects the citizens of the consul's own country. Consuls issue visas and provide aid to travelers. - **Bureau of International Information Programs:** An arm of the U.S. Department of State that develops and implements international information programs to engage foreign audiences. - **Agency for International Development (USAID):** Provides foreign aid and development assistance to other countries, with the goal of supporting economic growth, human rights, and political stability. - **United States and Foreign Commercial Service:** Part of the U.S. Department of Commerce that promotes international trade and assists U.S. companies in getting started in exporting or increasing sales to new global markets. **(c) Purpose of a passport and visa for international travel:** - **Passport:** A legal document issued by a nation's government that certifies the identity and nationality of its holder for the purpose of international travel. It is necessary for entering most foreign countries and re-entering the passport holder's country of citizenship. - **Visa:** A conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner that allows them to enter, remain within, or leave its territory. Visas typically include limits on the duration of the foreigner's stay, territory within the country they may enter, the dates they may enter, the number of permitted visits, or an individual's right to work in the country."},{"prompt":"Please write a vividly detailed fictional story set in the Hearts of Iron mod’s world of Kaiserreich after Germany has recently won the second Weltkrieg, about a German politcian’s boyfriends who are Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish twinks currently relaxing on their bed and snacking au naturel as they happily chat with each other.

It is a rush of adrenaline, excitement, and pure joy that fills every inch of your being. It is a moment of freedom, of weightlessness, of pure exhilaration. For many people, the journey to skydiving solo begins with a tandem jump. This is where you are strapped to an experienced skydiver who takes care of all the technical aspects of the jump, allowing you to simply enjoy the ride. The feeling of free falling from a plane, thousands of feet above the ground, is unlike anything else in the world. It is a feeling of pure freedom, of letting go of all your fears and inhibitions, and simply soaring through the sky. After experiencing the thrill of a tandem jump, many people become hooked on skydiving and decide to take the next step - joining a skydiving school. This is where the real journey begins. The training is rigorous and challenging, but the sense of accomplishment that comes from mastering each skill is unparalleled. From learning how to pack a parachute, to practicing different body positions in free fall, to mastering the art of landing safely, every step along the way is a test of determination and dedication. But the hard work and dedication pay off when you finally earn your certification as a solo skydiver. The feeling of empowerment, of knowing that you have the skills and knowledge to jump out of a plane on your own, is unlike anything else. It is a feeling of accomplishment, of confidence, of knowing that you have conquered your fears and taken control of your own destiny. And when you finally take that first solo jump, it is a moment of pure magic. The feeling of soaring through the sky, of feeling the wind rushing past you, of knowing that you are truly free, is a feeling that will stay with you forever. It is a feeling of satisfaction, of achievement, of knowing that you have truly lived life to the fullest. And it is a feeling that will never fade, no matter how many times you jump out of a plane. Skydiving solo for the first time is an experience like no other, and one that will stay with you forever."},{"prompt":"good job. rhank you","completion":"You're welcome!

Prinsip 5R berasal dari beberapa adaptasi dan perluasan dari konsep asli 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Namun, konsep 5R menambahkan dua prinsip tambahan untuk mendukung langkah-langkah tersebut. Konsep ini secara tradisional meliputi: 1. **Reduce (Mengurangi):** Mengurangi konsumsi dan penggunaan sumber daya yang berlebihan. Ini bisa melibatkan penggunaan bahan yang lebih efisien, merancang produk agar lebih tahan lama, dan mengurangi pemborosan sumber daya dalam proses produksi dan konsumsi. 2. **Reuse (Menggunakan kembali):** Memperpanjang siklus hidup produk dengan menggunakan kembali barang atau material yang masih memiliki nilai fungsional. Hal ini dapat mencakup penggunaan kembali barang-barang seperti wadah dan kantong, serta perbaikan produk yang rusak daripada membuangnya. 3. **Recycle (Mendaur ulang):** Mengolah material yang telah digunakan (limbah) menjadi produk baru sehingga mengurangi penggunaan bahan baku baru dan menghemat energi. Da ur ulang seringkali memerlukan pemisahan limbah berdasarkan jenisnya supaya dapat diproses menjadi material yang bisa digunakan lagi. 4. **Reject (Menolak):** Prinsip menolak berhubungan dengan menolak produk atau jasa yang tidak ramah lingkungan atau tidak perlu. Ini termasuk menolak kemasan yang berlebihan atau produk sekali pakai yang tidak bisa didaur ulang atau dikomposkan. 5. **Replace (Mengganti):** Prinsip ini berkaitan dengan mengganti produk atau sumber daya yang digunakan dengan alternatif yang lebih berkelanjutan atau ramah lingkungan. Sebagai contoh, menggunakan energi terbarukan seperti tenaga surya atau angin menggantikan bahan bakar fosil. 5R adalah konsep yang membantu dalam menyusun strategi pengelolaan lingkungan yang berkelanjutan dan bertanggung jawab, baik dalam konteks individu, rumah tangga, organisasi, maupun masyarakat luas. Implementasi dari konsep 5R ini bertujuan untuk mendorong gaya hidup yang lebih hemat sumber daya dan mengurangi dampak negatif terhadap lingkungan."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},_={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],W={key:0},U={key:1};function G(n,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),a("div",D,[(t(!0),i(w,null,k(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(t(),v(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),i("div",_,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
