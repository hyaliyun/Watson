These forces include factors like competition, consumer preferences, technological advancements, and government regulations. In a free-market system, prices are determined by these forces, influencing the allocation of resources. In a capitalist structure, power dynamics are shaped by the ownership and control of the means of production. The bourgeoisie, as owners of capital and productive resources, control the economic forces that drive society. This ownership allows them to accumulate wealth and exert influence over the production and distribution of goods and services. They are in possession of tools that is lend to the working class in order to make money in exchange of a wage. The bourgoisie, as employers, extract surplus value from the labor of the working class. This exploitation contributes to the accumulation of capital and the perpetuation of class distinctions. The concept of private property, central to capitalist structures, empowers the bourgeoisie to accumulate and pass down wealth through generations. This concentration of property contributes to the perpetuation of social and economic inequalities. These concepts are the economical structure of capitalism, called the base. The economic base is foundational, shaping and influencing the development of the superstructure. The superstructure is the influence of the bourgoisie to all non-economic institutions such as government, media, and education. Through lobbying, campaign financing, and other mechanisms, they shape policies that often favor their economic interests, contributing to the maintenance of their power. This also create an ideological hegemony where the ruling class shapes perceptions and acceptance of the existing economic system. Exploitation is now seen as a norm because education and cultural values emphatize on hard work, loyalty to employers, and the acceptance of authority. This base and superstructure model is however not complete, as they can't fully explain all of society. There are other forms of oppression of social categories such as race, gender, and sexuality. Because of that, the base-superstructure model is not determinist. As capitalism evolved, corporations emerged as powerful entities, leading to the rise of corporatocracy. Large corporations began to exert significant influence over economic and political spheres, shaping policies to favor their interests, causing exploitation of resources and cheap labor in other regions contributes to the perpetuation of global economic inequalities and environmental degradation. Oligopolistic structures often emerge as a result of mergers, acquisitions, and the global expansion of corporations seeking to dominate markets on an international scale. This leads to less competition, less innovation and more stable prices in order to avoid price wars that could erode their profits. ndividuals generally seek liberty and the pursuit of happiness but there are many perspectives on what constitutes true freedom : Capitalists view economic liberty as a way to fulfill one's desire. They see the ability to own, use and trade money without authority in the market as essential to individual freedom. Marxists view freedom when a society is classless, moneyless and stateless. This way there is no exploitation of one self to another. Mutualists view freedom as voluntary cooperation among individuals. It oppose hierarchical structures like a state and *usually* promote a decentralized free-market.\\"","completion":"Market forces shape the dynamics of supply and demand within an economy, where factors such as competition, consumer preference, and government regulation influence prices and resource allocation. Within this capitalist framework, the bourgeoisie, owners of capital, command economic power, generating wealth through the employment and exploitation of the working class. The private property model further entrenches social and economic inequalities. The bourgeoisie's control extends beyond the economic base to the superstructure, influencing government, media, and education to maintain power and shape ideology. Yet, this model doesn't encompass all societal oppression; other dimensions include race, gender, and sexuality. The evolution of capitalism has given rise to corporatocracies, where powerful corporations shape policy, often at the expense of global equality and the environment. While oligopolies may lead to market stability, they can also stifle competition and innovation. Perspectives on freedom vary, from capitalist views of economic liberty to Marxist ideals of a classless society, to mutualists endorsing voluntary cooperation and a decentralized market."},{"prompt":"In simple terms...","completion":"Market forces dictate how goods and services are traded in an economy, affecting prices and where resources go. In capitalism, the rich—those who own businesses—gain more wealth and power by employing and profiting from workers. They control not just the economy but also influence society's rules and culture, often keeping their wealth and power intact. As capitalism has grown, big corporations now have a lot of say in politics and international affairs, which can lead to unfair practices and environmental harm. Not everyone agrees on the best form of freedom; some say it's about making money without restrictions, while others believe it's about living in a society with no classes or having a society where people work together by choice without a strict hierarchy."},{"prompt":"","completion":"There are many different ways to react in difficult situations, as it depends on the specific circumstances and individual preferences. Here are some possible reactions: 1. Remain calm and assess the situation: Taking a moment to collect your thoughts and evaluate the situation can help you formulate a plan or decide on the best course of action. 2. Seek support from others: Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or colleagues for advice, guidance, or simply someone to talk to. Sharing your concerns with others can help alleviate stress and provide a fresh perspective. 3. Take a break: If you're feeling overwhelmed, it can be helpful to take a step back from the situation and engage in activities that help you relax and recharge. 4. Problem-solve: Analyze the problem and identify possible solutions. Consider the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that seems most appropriate. 5. Acceptance and adaptability: Sometimes, difficult situations are out of your control. In such cases, accepting the situation and adapting to the changes can help you move forward and make the best of the circumstances. 6. Seek professional help: If the situation seems too overwhelming or if you're struggling to cope, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide you with the necessary support and guidance. 7. Practice self-care: Engaging in activities that promote self-care can be beneficial during difficult times. This may include exercise, meditation, spending time in nature, or engaging in hobbies that bring you joy.

The tests are administered by the FAA and can be taken at various FAA-approved testing centers. There is no flight test or practical exam (oral exam) required for the AGI certificate. Once you pass the written exams, you will need to submit the appropriate paperwork, and then you will be issued the certificate. As for currency requirements, a ground instructor certificate does not expire, so there is no requirement to renew it or maintain currency in the same way that a flight instructor needs to. However, as a ground instructor, if you want to be able to endorse applicants for a knowledge test, you must have given at least one hour of instruction on the subject areas for that knowledge test in the preceding 12 calendar-months. To stay current and effective as an instructor, it's still a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest information, regulations, and teaching methods, even though the FAA does not require it for ground instructors. To summarize, the path to getting an AGI certificate involves passing two written exams without the need for an oral exam or flight test, and there are no recurring currency requirements to keep the AGI certificate valid."},{"prompt":"How would I log that one hour of instruction?

Would that count, and do I just log it in the same logbook I do my flight hour logging in?","completion":"To log the one hour of instruction that you've provided as a Ground Instructor to be able to endorse applicants for a knowledge test, you can use a variety of methods. There is no specific requirement from the FAA regarding exactly how this instruction must be logged, but it should be done in a way that is clear, verifiable, and able to be produced if ever requested by the FAA or another authorizing body. For your situation where you might teach a class at a Civil Air Patrol (CAP) squadron, here's what you could do: 1. **Create a log entry**: You can log the instruction in a simple logbook, a digital record, or in any other reliable record-keeping system. Some ground instructors use the same logbook as they do for flight time, while others maintain a separate log specifically for their ground instruction activities. 2. **Information to include**: The log should include the date, the duration of the instruction, the subject taught, and the names of the students or the class. It may also be helpful to include the objectives or syllabus topics covered during the hour of instruction. 3. **Documentation support**: In addition to logging this information, it can be useful to keep supporting documentation, such as lesson plans, attendance sheets, or outlines of the materials taught, especially if you are giving instruction in a formal class setting like a CAP squadron meeting. 4. **CAP records**: If you are teaching a class in a structured organization like CAP, they may also have internal records of the class, which you can retain a copy of for your records as further support of the instruction provided. Remember that it's important to keep your log clear and accurate.

I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

His provocative statement encourages us to reconsider the roots and future trajectory of computation. He emphasizes the physical reality driving computational power, from the fundamental logic gates up to quantum bits. This compels us to think beyond abstract algorithms and data structures, urging integration across disciplines – physics for materials, biology for models like neural nets – to leap beyond our current local maxima. It's not a disservice to call computer science 'science', but perhaps a limiting perspective when we ponder future advancements in computation.

The artwork is Tom Holland in a pond in the nude, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process. Describe Tom’s reaction to the art","completion":"Title: Tom Holland and the Farting Fiasco - An Artistic Whiff of Victory Once upon an altered timeline, in a universe far from our own, the world had taken a strange twist. The victorious Germans, after winning the Second World War, had quite peculiar tastes in art. Gone were the days of pastoral landscapes and portraits of solemn soldiers; the new vogue was all about capturing the essence of the victorious Aryan race, often in the most unusual ways. It was in this peculiar world that an artist by the name of Dieter Von Künstler grew to prominence. Dieter was known for his unorthodox methods and his latest commission was one that perfectly embodied his eccentricities. His subject was no other than the celebrated Anglo-Saxon actor, Tom Holland, renowned for his fair features which now symbolized a long-lost heritage. One bright, sunny day, Dieter had a vision. A vision of Tom Holland, not swinging from high-rise buildings, but rather engaging in the most bizarre and comical form of fishing ever depicted. \\"Tom und der Teichfürze,\\" the painting would be called; Tom and the Pond Farts, in the tongue of the old world. The setting for this masterpiece was a serene pond, tucked away in a forest of conifers – a picturesque nook of peace post-war. In the center of the pond was Tom, cast in the nude, not an inch of fabric to mar the purity of his Anglo-Saxon skin. The pose was chosen with great care: Tom squatting with a cheeky grin, a hand casually wafting behind him, as if he were conducting an orchestra of bubbles rising from the murky depths. Around him, fish floated with bellies turned skyward, victims of Tom's deadly derrière. Dieter, with his paintbrush as his weapon, captured each detail with vivid aplomb. With each stroke, the water shimmered with the gassy turmoil underneath, crafting ripples that reached the edge of the canvas. The trees bent slightly, as if even they were trying to escape the noxious fumes. A playful glint was painted in Tom's eyes, immortalizing the very moment of mischievous satisfaction. When the time came to unveil the painting to Tom, the moment was fraught with tension. Dieter, wearing his finest lederhosen and twirling his handlebar mustache, beamed with pride as the curtain was drawn. Tom's reaction was one for the history books. At first, there was shock, Tom's face blanching as he took in the... unapologetically unique presentation of his form. His eyes widened at the detail of his own physique, rendered in such an unguarded state. But then, as the sheer absurdity of the scene registered, a snort escaped him, followed by a cascade of laughter. The depiction was so outlandish, so profoundly ridiculous, that Tom couldn't help but applaud the artist's audacity. He approached Dieter, clapping him firmly on the back and shaking his hand with a newfound respect for the man's impish artistic vision. \\"Well, Dieter,\\" Tom chuckled, \\"you've certainly captured my... best angle. The world shall never forget the deadly power of my, shall we say, 'natural talents'!\\" And so, \\"Tom und der Teichfürze\\" was hung in the grand hall of the Germanic Museum of Superior Art. It became an instant sensation, prompting both horrified gasps and raucous laughter. Tom Holland's farting fiasco had become the unlikely symbol of a complacent victory, a reminder that in a world ruled by the absurd, it's best to simply join in the fun."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

This isn't about the swelling that occurred prior to extraction, but in its aftermath.","completion":"Swelling around the cheeks and gums post-tooth extraction is typically a normal part of the healing process. However, when considering the causes and determining whether it's normal or indicative of a complication, several factors should be evaluated: 1. **Timing of the Swelling**: Some degree of swelling is expected after a tooth extraction, typically reaching its peak within 48 to 72 hours. After this period, the swelling should steadily decrease. 2. **Severity of Swelling**: A moderate amount of swelling is normal. If the swelling is excessive or gets worse after the first few days rather than better, it could indicate an infection or another issue. 3. **Pain**: It is normal to experience pain after an extraction, but the pain should be manageable with over-the-counter or prescribed pain medication and should gradually decrease over a few days. Increased pain along with swelling could point to complications such as a dry socket or infection. 4. **Signs of Infection**: Redness, warmth, pus, fever, and malodorous breath can be signs of an infection and should be evaluated by a dentist or oral surgeon. 5. **Oral Hygiene**: Proper oral hygiene after tooth extraction is crucial. Patients should follow all aftercare instructions provided by their dentist, including gentle rinsing with salt water and avoiding vigorous rinsing and suction. 6. **Patients’ Health Status**: Patients with systemic conditions like diabetes or those who are immunocompromised may experience delayed healing or be more susceptible to infection. 7. **Dry Socket (Alveolar Osteitis)**: This is a painful condition that can occur when the blood clot at the site of the tooth extraction is dislodged or dissolves before the wound has healed, exposing the underlying bone and nerves. It is characterized by intense pain that doesn't improve with typical pain relief medications and usually begins a few days after the extraction. 8. **Trauma during Extraction**: The amount of swelling can correlate with the difficulty of the extraction. If the extraction was surgical or particularly traumatic, more swelling can be expected. It is important to monitor the swelling and consult with the dental professional who performed the extraction if: - The swelling continues to worsen after the first few days. - You experience new or worsening pain. - You present with signs of infection, such as pus, fever, or increasing pain. - You suspect a dry socket or have unbearable pain emanating from the extraction site. The dentist or oral surgeon can provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment, which might include antibiotics, pain management, or additional interventions to support healing, depending on the underlying cause of the post-extraction swelling."},{"prompt":"Make a comedic and vividly detailed story set in a universe where Germany won WWII about a sculptor making a marble statue of Tom Holland due to his Anglo-Saxon ethnicity. Tom enters the studio and undresses, posing for the statue in the buff. Describe how the statue looks during the process. Describe Tom’s reaction to the statue. Add dialogue between the sculptor and Tom throughout","completion":"Title: The Marble Mischief of Tom Holland In an alternate reality where history took a dark turn and Germany won WWII, the world became a peculiar place. After the war, the victorious overlords mandated that art should celebrate not just German prowess, but the Greek classical beauty of the Anglo-Saxon form. Thus, came the decree for the commission of a marble statue of none other than Tom Holland, globally renowned for his exceedingly English features and superhero flexibility. Our sculptor, Klaus von Stein, was a man of great talent and even greater eccentricity. His studio, nestled in the heart of what was once London, was cluttered with marble chips and statues of various stages of undress. Klaus, with his wild white hair and goggles perpetually perched atop his forehead, resembled an alchemist more than an artist. His commission was clear: a life-size marble image of the delightful Tom Holland... in his birthday suit. On a misty Monday morning, Tom strolled into the studio, casually sipping a cup of tea he somehow managed to snag in a world bereft of British comforts. Snapping his cup down, he said with a mischievous grin, \\"Righto, Klaus. Where do you want me to unveil the, ahem, 'National Treasure'?\\" \\"Zere, on ze pedestal! Make yourself komfortabel, but please, don't sneeze or you'll become a Greek tragedy,\\" Klaus instructed, pointing to a stand decorated with velvet. Tom dropped his garments with the same carefree ease he might flick aside a spiderweb. Klaus twirled his mustache, assessing the subject like a general surveying a battlefield. The sculptor's fingers began their dance across the clay model, Tom's bare likeness emerging. With chisel in hand, Klaus approached a pristine block of Carrara marble, his eyes gleaming. He whispered sweet nothings to the stone, convinced it enhanced his skill. \\"You're going to be as stunning as young Tom over there; just you wait...\\" As Klaus carved, the statue took form, hilariously detailed in its depiction of Tom's surprised expression, every muscle tensely frozen in marble. With each strike of the chisel, Tom's immortalized form appeared more flabbergasted by its own naked boldness. One fine day, the statue's creation reached completion. Tom circled his stony twin, eyes wide, trying to ascertain whether he was flattered or mortified. \\"Blimey, Klaus. You've got my bum spot on, but did you have to chisel each individual hair?\\" \\"Every masterpiece requires its own... textures, Herr Holland,\\" Klaus replied, polishing a particularly prominent muscle on the statue with gusto. \\"Besides, people from ze future must know that even the hero's tiniest details were heroically proportioned!\\" The statue stood, a pillar of comical virility with its chiseled abs and an expression of 'I've forgotten my trousers!' across its face. Classic yet strikingly contemporary, it juxtaposed Tom's youthful visage with the body of a Greek god, unfortunately resembling more of a shocked satyr caught in a spotlight than the adonis they were aiming for. Tom chuckled, \\"Well, at least that startled look will keep the pigeons at bay from—we wouldn't want any unsightly stains on the family jewels, now would we?\\" \\"Indeed, we shall leave the shitting to the birds,\\" Klaus agreed, his laughter mixing with the swirling marble dust in the air. Though the statue was meant to be a serious piece of propagandistic art, it became something of a humorous landmark. Onlookers couldn't help but release a stifled giggle at the sight of Tom's forever surprised marbled cheeks. And so Klaus von Stein's creation stood as a testament not to the might of those who'd won the war, but to the inadvertent humor that can arise when art, history, and a healthy dose of accidental nudity collide."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

The outermost loop (lines 2-8) runs from 2n to 3n. This means it has n iterations. 2. The second loop (lines 3-7) runs from 1 to n⌊log_2(n)⌋. Since ⌊log_2(n)⌋ is the greatest integer less than or equal to the binary logarithm of n, this loop might not iterate up to n times, but its number of iterations is directly proportional to the logarithm of n. We can use log(n) to denote ⌊log_2(n)⌋ to simplify. 3. The innermost loop (lines 4-6) runs from 2j + 5 to 2j + 8, which results in exactly 4 iterations - irrespective of the value of j since the loop starts at 2j + 5 and ends at 2j + 8. Now let's write the summation to represent the loops: T(n) = ∑ (from i = 2n to 3n) ∑ (from j = 1 to n⌊log_2(n)⌋) ∑ (from k = 2j+5 to 2j+8) 1 Since the innermost loop runs for a fixed 4 iterations, we can rewrite the summation to extract the constant factor of the innermost loop: T(n) = ∑ (from i = 2n to 3n) ∑ (from j = 1 to n⌊log_2(n)⌋) 4 This simplifies to: T(n) = 4 * ∑ (from i = 2n to 3n) ∑ (from j = 1 to n⌊log_2(n)⌋) 1 The second loop runs for n⌊log_2(n)⌋ iterations: T(n) = 4 * ∑ (from i = 2n to 3n) n⌊log_2(n)⌋ Now, the outermost loop runs for n iterations: T(n) = 4 * n * n⌊log_2(n)⌋ * ∑ (from i = 2n to 3n) 1 T(n) = 4 * n^2 * ⌊log_2(n)⌋ Since the upper bound and lower bound for ⌊log_2(n)⌋ differ only by a constant factor (because ⌊log_2(n)⌋ is at most log_2(n) and at least log_2(n) - 1), we can just consider it as O(log(n)) for the big O notation. Thus, our complexity simplifies further: T(n) = O(n^2 * log(n)) Therefore, the running time of Func1(n) is O(n^2 * log(n)). The upper bound is justified by the direct multiplication of the counts of iterations from each of the three loops, and the lower bound is justified by the consideration of the constant number of iterations (4) in the innermost loop.

The first loop (lines 2-8) runs from \`i = 2n\` to \`i = 3n\`. The number of iterations in this loop is \`(3n - 2n) = n\` because each iteration increases \`i\` by 1 until it reaches the exclusive upper bound \`3n\`. The second loop (lines 3-7) runs from \`j = 1\` to \`j = n⌊log_2(n)⌋\`. The value \`⌊log_2(n)⌋\` is the floor function of logarithm base 2 of \`n\`, which grows at a logarithmic rate.

The heart of this cultural renaissance, or so they dubbed it, was found in a bizarrely baroque-style studio in downtown Neu-Berlin, where the zeitgeist of the age was to immortalize the greatest Anglo-Saxon figures in stone - for irony, for posterity, or just for giggles. Enter Ludwig von Schnitzelberg, the most renowned sculptor of the age—part artist, part madman, wholly dedicated to his craft. Ludwig's latest commission was no less than a magnum opus: a life-size statue of Tom Holland, the preeminent Anglo-Saxon actor known for his roles in historically reimagined Spider-Reich series. \\"Ah, Herr Holland, welcome to my humble atelier. Today, you shall be immortalized in marble, a tribute to your Anglo-Saxon excellence,\\" said Ludwig, his thin moustache twitching with excitement. Tom, nervously chuckling, replied, \\"Right then. Not exactly how I saw today going when I woke up this morning, but suppose being a statue is one way to, um, stick around.\\" The studio—a cathedral to eccentricity—was filled with statues of various sizes and poses, but none so peculiar as the one proposed. Dressed in nothing but confidence and a smirk, Tom disrobed, striking a heroic pose, one hand on his hip, the other flexing a casual peace sign. Ludwig scrutinized Tom's form: the lean, agile build of a professional web-slinger, with muscle definition that spoke of many hours in choreographed combat against CGI villains. \\"Excellent! Your physique is quite superb—a testament to the genetic lottery,\\" Ludwig praised, as he began to etch the marble with feverish strokes. Tom lifted an eyebrow, \\"Er, cheers? Just don't make my bum look big, yeah?\\" Throughout the weeks, the block of marble morphed from a cold, lifeless form into a spitting image of Tom Holland, complete with trademark tousled hair and boyish charm. Ludwig's chisel danced in a frenetic ballet, dispatching marble chips in flurries around the room. Each day, as Tom posed, the statue evolved, its details sharp enough to rival the crispness of high-definition television. As Ludwig added the final touches, he stepped back, staring at the statue with the same intensity a cat bestows upon a laser pointer. \\"Vunderbar! The detail, the poise... it almost breathes!\\" Tom, always humble—still standing in his birthday suit—squinted at his stony doppelganger. \\"Wow, Ludwig, you’ve even got my quiff right. That’s some serious attention to detail.

Add dialogue between the sculptor and Tom throughout","completion":"In an alternative universe where Germany reigned supreme after World War II, the echoes of the war had finally faded, and a new world order had taken hold. It was a reality where art was harvested not just for expression, but also for propaganda, manifesting racial ideologies in tangible forms. In the heart of what was once London, now transformed into a hub for the occupiers’ culture and power, stood a studio spacious and sunlit. It was untouched by the war that had reshaped the world; its tall windows opened to a cityscape defined by spires of victory and monuments of conquest. A sculptor named Friedhelm Weber had been commissioned by the new regime to create a series of statues honoring the Aryan ideal. His latest project was to sculpt an influential figure from the diluted lines of the Anglo-Saxon ethnicity, to symbolize a twisted union of the conquered and the conquerors—a token of supposed inclusivity and grace from the ruling power. Tom Holland, a young actor celebrated for his classical features and Anglo-Saxon lineage, had been chosen as the model for this unsettling tribute. The day had come for Tom to enter Friedhelm's studio and assume the pose that would be immortalized in marble. Upon arrival, Friedhelm greeted Tom with the customary pleasantries, veiled in a professional coldness. “Mr. Holland, it’s a pleasure. We must capture your essence for generations to admire.” Tom, aware of the undercurrents of the project but bound by circumstance, replied with a cautious smile, “Thank you, Mr. Weber. I only hope I can meet the expectations of your craft.” Tom disrobed, revealing a physique that belied the insipid ideology being perpetrated by his form. He was not the hulking figure often glorified by the regime's propaganda, but rather lean and lithe, muscles defined not by labor or war but by the grace and agility of an artist. His form was a living contradiction to the state's ideal, and yet it was this very paradox that had caught their whimsy. As Tom struck the chosen pose, one of humility with an undercurrent of resilience, Friedhelm began his work. The statue emerged slowly from blocks of white marble, rough-hewn at first, gradually taking on defined contours of a man. The resemblance to Tom was uncanny; the high cheekbones, the intense eyes, and the charmingly quixotic curl of his lips were rendered with painstaking detail. “Does it please you, seeing yourself born anew in stone?” Friedhelm inquired, chipping away excess marble with short, practiced strokes. Tom eyed the evolving statue, a bizarre mirror to his own form. “It's surreal. To be honest, it both fascinates and disturbs me.” The sculptor paused, mallet in hand. “It is the blessing and curse of our art, to immortalize moments and men. Sometimes for reasons we may not always agree with.” As weeks turned to months, the statue took its final form. The artist had captured Tom’s physical traits with exquisite artistry, down to the fine lines of strain and the gentle curve of muscle. Intricate details like the texture of hair, the weave of muscle fibers, and the subtle tension in the pose spoke of Friedhelm's mastery. Upon completion, Tom was invited to behold the finished work. Standing before the marble doppelganger, he was awestruck by the realism, the detail, and the dichotomy of beauty and ideology encapsulated in stone. “It’s remarkable,” Tom admitted with a catch in his throat, “and yet...” “And yet it does not truly represent you, does it?” Friedhelm asked, reading the unease in Tom's eyes. “Art, Mr. Holland, can be both the mirror and the mask. Today, it is the latter.” Tom nodded, understanding the sculptor's sentiment. “It will stand for centuries, a symbol I never chose.” “Nor I. Yet,” Friedhelm murmured with a hint of defiance, “perhaps one day it will stand for something else. Time has a way of reshaping not just marble but the meanings they bear. May it be a testament to the man and not the madness of his time.” And with a last look at his own marble gaze, Tom Holland dressed and left the studio, the strange intimacy of the process lingering, a sense that he had left behind more than just the model for an artwork but also a piece of his identity—a piece now frozen in stone and subject to the interpretation of future ages."},{"prompt":"Determine the running time of the following algorithms.

First, we analyze the loop ranges: - The outer loop (line 2) runs from \`2n\` to \`3n\`, which represents \`n\` iterations. - The middle loop (line 3) runs from \`1\` to \`n⌊log_2⁡n⌋\`. Since the logarithm function is monotonically increasing, \`⌊log_2⁡n⌋\` is a non-negative number that is at most equal to \`log_2⁡n\`. Hence, the number of iterations in the worst case is \`n * log_2⁡n\` because the floor function can only decrease \`log_2⁡n\` by less than 1. - The inner loop (line 4) runs from \`2j+5\` to \`2j+8\`, which represents 4 iterations (note that \`k\` goes up to \`2j+8\` and starts at \`2j+5\`, so it takes the values \`2j+5\`, \`2j+6\`, \`2j+7\`, and \`2j+8\`). Now let's formulate the time complexity using summations (starting from the innermost loop and working our way out): \`T(n) = ∑_(i=2n)^(3n) ∑_(j=1)^(n⌊log_2⁡n⌋) ∑_(k=2j+5)^(2j+8) 1\` The innermost sum (over \`k\`) is simply a constant, since there are always 4 iterations regardless of \`j\`: \`T(n) = ∑_(i=2n)^(3n) ∑_(j=1)^(n⌊log_2⁡n⌋) 4\` Since the summation over \`k\` evaluates to 4, we can remove the sum over \`k\` and multiply by 4: \`T(n) = 4 * ∑_(i=2n)^(3n) ∑_(j=1)^(n⌊log_2⁡n⌋) 1\` The next sum (over \`j\`) has \`n * ⌊log_2⁡n⌋\` iterations. Since \`⌊log_2⁡n⌋\` is at most \`log_2⁡n\` and at least \`log_2⁡n - 1\`, we can say that the number of iterations is \`O(n * log_2⁡n)\`: \`T(n) = 4 * ∑_(i=2n)^(3n) (n * ⌊log_2⁡n⌋)\` Simplifying, we get: \`T(n) = 4n * ⌊log_2⁡n⌋ * ∑_(i=2n)^(3n) 1\` Now, the outer sum (over \`i\`) has \`n\` iterations because it runs from \`2n\` to \`3n\`: \`T(n) = 4n * ⌊log_2⁡n⌋ * n\` \`T(n) = 4n^2 * ⌊log_2⁡n⌋\` Given the floor function, in the tightest bound, we would consider the range of the lower and upper bounds as follows: Lower Bound \`L(n) = 4n^2 * (log_2⁡n - 1)\` Upper Bound \`U(n) = 4n^2 * log_2⁡n\` Both differ by a term that is \`4n^2\`, which is less significant compared to \`4n^2 * log_2⁡n\` when \`n\` grows large: Now we can say that the complexity of Func1 is in \`O(n^2 * log_2⁡n)\`, which represents the upper bound (it's the upper bound because in algorithm analysis we usually focus on the worst-case scenario, and the floor function only decreases the term \`log_2⁡n\` by less than 1, which means it can be bounded by \`log_2⁡n\`). In conclusion, the running time of Func1 is \`O(n^2 * log_2⁡n)\` considering the upper bound."},{"prompt":"Determine the running time of the following algorithms.

To simplify, we can use the fact that the logarithm grows slowly and apply an approximate upper and lower bound. The lower and upper bounds for \`⌊log_2⁡n⌋\` would simply be \`log_2⁡n-1\` and \`log_2⁡n\`, respectively, which differ by only a constant factor, so we can safely say the middle loop runs \`n⌊log_2⁡n⌋\` times, which is at most \`n⋅log_2⁡n\` iterations per each iteration of the outer loop. - The inner loop (line 4) runs from \`2j+5\` to \`2j+8\`, which is always \`4\` iterations, regardless of the value of \`j\`. Putting it all together, we write a nested summation to represent the total number of iterations: [ text{Total Iterations} = sum_{i=2n}^{3n} left( sum_{j=1}^{n⌊log_2⁡n⌋} left( sum_{k=2j+5}^{2j+8} 1 right) right) ] We can simplify by considering the innermost sum: [ sum_{k=2j+5}^{2j+8} 1 = 4 ] Since for each value of \`j\`, the innermost loop runs \`4\` times, we can replace this innermost sum with \`4\`. Now the total number of iterations becomes: [ text{Total Iterations} = sum_{i=2n}^{3n} left( sum_{j=1}^{n⌊log_2⁡n⌋} 4 right) ] This simplifies to: [ text{Total Iterations} = sum_{i=2n}^{3n} left( 4 cdot n⌊log_2⁡n⌋ right) ] Since the middle sum is simply a multiplication of the number of iterations of \`j\` with \`4\`, and we've established that the middle loop runs at most \`n⋅log_2⁡n\` times, we have: [ text{Total Iterations} = sum_{i=2n}^{3n} (4 cdot n cdot log_2⁡n) ] We have \`n\` iterations of the outer loop, each contributing \`4n⋅log_2⁡n\` operations: [ text{Total Iterations} = n cdot (4 cdot n cdot log_2⁡n) ] Now, we can simplify the expression: [ text{Total Iterations} = 4n^2 cdot log_2⁡n ] So, the running time of the algorithm \`Func1(n)\` is \`O(n^2⋅log_2⁡n)\`, which represents the number of times the innermost statement (line 5) is executed."},{"prompt":"Create a system for a a strategy game, this system will handle how to send the builders to construct buildings * Its name will be BuilderManager * When a building is created, it will call the builder manager and the building will be added to the queue * When a Builder is created it will call the builder manager ant he will be marked as an available builder * When there is a building to be build and there is a builder available it will start to build the building for a time and the builder will be marked as busy","completion":"To implement the system you've described, we can define a simple class-based structure in pseudo-code: \`\`\`pseudo class BuilderManager: def __init__(self): self.build_queue = [] # Queue of buildings waiting to be constructed self.available_builders = [] # List of available builders def add_building_to_queue(self, building): self.build_queue.append(building) self.assign_builder() def register_builder(self, builder): self.available_builders.append(builder) self.assign_builder() def assign_builder(self): if self.build_queue and self.available_builders: building = self.build_queue.pop(0) builder = self.available_builders.pop(0) builder.start_construction(building) # When the construction starts, the builder is busy with the current building # so we remove it from the available builders list def release_builder(self, builder): self.available_builders.append(builder) self.assign_builder() # Check if there are buildings waiting to be constructed class Building: def __init__(self, name, construction_time): self.name = name self.construction_time = construction_time # Notify BuilderManager that a new building is ready to be queued when created BuilderManager.add_building_to_queue(self) class Builder: def __init__(self, id): self.id = id self.is_busy = False # Notify BuilderManager that a new builder is available when created BuilderManager.register_builder(self) def start_construction(self, building): self.is_busy = True self.current_building = building # Ideally, here we would start a timer and mark the builder as not busy after the time has elapsed. # In pseudo-code, we'll represent this concept simply as: Timer.start(building.construction_time, self.finish_construction) def finish_construction(self): # Called when the building is finished self.is_busy = False self.current_building = None # Notify BuilderManager that the builder is now available BuilderManager.release_builder(self) # Timer is a pseudo-code representation of some scheduling system in place, in a real-world scenario, # this could be a thread, coroutine, or other asynchronous call that would wait for the required time # before invoking the callback. class Timer: @staticmethod def start(seconds, callback): # Wait for 'seconds' duration # Once 'seconds' have passed, execute callback function // Example usage: BuilderManager = BuilderManager() builder1 = Builder(id=1) building1 = Building(name=\\"House\\", construction_time=120) // this will automatically enqueue the house to be built BuilderManager.assign_builder() // builder1 will be assigned to building1 if there are no other buildings in the queue \`\`\` This pseudo-code outlines the basic system that you can expand upon to meet the complexity of your strategy game.

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

Loop on line 2 runs from \`1\` to \`10⌊n^0.5⌋\`; let's denote \`k = 10⌊n^0.5⌋\` which indicates that this loop runs \`k\` times. Loop on line 3 runs from \`1\` to \`i^2\` for each value of \`i\`. Let's express the total number of times the innermost statement (line 4) is executed using a summation that accounts for both loops. The running time ( T(n) ) is determined by the total number of times line 4 is executed, as all other operations are constant time in comparison. [ T(n) = sum_{i=1}^{k} sum_{j=1}^{i^2} 1 = sum_{i=1}^{k} i^2 ] Since ( k = 10⌊n^0.5⌋ approx 10n^{0.5} ) (since ( ⌊x⌋ ) is the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ), this approximation is within a constant factor), we can say ( T(n) ) is proportional to the sum of the squares of the first ( 10n^{0.5} ) natural numbers. Now let's simplify and get an upper bound: [ T(n) = sum_{i=1}^{10n^{0.5}} i^2 approx frac{10n^{0.5}(10n^{0.5}+1)(2 cdot 10n^{0.5}+1)}{6} ] This uses the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) squares, which is ( sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} ). We can remove the floor operation because the sum of ( i^2 ) is always increasing with ( i ) and removing the floor will make the expression larger, giving us an upper bound. Simplifying further, we get an approximation for ( T(n) ): [ T(n) approx frac{10n^{0.5} cdot 10n^{0.5} cdot 20n^{0.5}}{6} = frac{2000n^{1.5}}{6} = frac{1000n^{1.5}}{3} ] This expression has a leading term of ( frac{1000}{3}n^{1.5} ), which implies that the running time of \`Func2(n)\` has a time complexity of ( O(n^{1.5}) ). Other terms in the expansion are of lower order, and hence the leading term determines the asymptotic behavior of the running time. Therefore, the running time of the algorithm \`Func2(n)\` is upper-bounded by ( O(n^{1.5}) ), which means for large values of ( n ), the time complexity is approximately proportional to ( n^{1.5} )."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed story set in a universe where Germany won WWII about a sculptor making a statue of Tom Holland due to his Anglo-Saxon ethnicity.

In this reality, the cultural values were distilled to glorify the purity of ancient European heritage. The sculpting scene was buzzing with works that celebrated the idealized Aryan form. It was the dawn of a gloomy day in the year 2055 when the prominent sculptor, Klaus Weber, set out to capture the essence of such heritage through his newest project. At the heart of neo-Victorian England, formally known as the Anglo-Saxon Province, his studio stood as a citadel of creativity amidst the rigid world outside. His subject was none other than Tom Holland, a rare find in the entertainment industry whose Anglo-Saxon ethnicity made him a choice subject for the regime's propaganda. Upon entering Klaus' studio, Tom was immediately struck by the array of tools and half-finished sculptures of prominent figures; each one capturing a poise suited to their elevated status in this new world order. The mood between artist and subject was one of reluctant professionalism. Klaus, a middle-aged man with sharp features and intense blue eyes, had the reputation of being a cold perfectionist. Tom, however, carried the aura of someone who had learned to adapt to their twisted reality, with an easy smile and a chameleon's grace. \\"Please, make yourself comfortable, Mr. Holland,\\" Klaus started, pointing to a wooden pedestal at the center of his studio. He needed Tom to pose in such a way that would emphasize the genetic pedigree the regime prided itself upon. As Tom disrobed, Klaus silently assessed the sinewy lines of muscle that defined the actor's physique. He wasn't overly bulky but had the toned and limber build of a practiced performer, perfected by years of hard work and dedication. \\"You want me like this?\\" Tom asked, adopting a classic contrapposto stance, weight shifted onto one leg as his body formed a soft 'S' curve, a nod to the sculptural masters of the Renaissance. \\"Yes, perfect,\\" Klaus murmured, circling Tom with a cool appraising eye. Picking up his tools, he started with a lump of greyish clay, slapping and shaping it onto a skeletal frame that stood as tall as the actor himself. Over the days, as Tom returned to pose and the statue began to take shape, a form of camaraderie grew between the two men. The statue mirrored Tom's physique in a stylized form; Klaus chiseled the muscles with a touch more definition, the torso a shade more heroic. It was the idealized version of Tom, sculpted to transcend the imperfections of flesh. \\"So, how does it feel to be the model of perfection?\\" Klaus asked in a rare moment of humor, chiseling away at the marble that would immortalize Tom's likeness. Tom, watching the transformation, couldn't help but feel a disconnect. \\"It's not me. I mean, it looks like me, but...\\" His voice trailed off as he observed the biceps and abs being smoothed out with artistic license. Klaus halted his work, looking up at Tom. \\"Art is the pursuit of an ideal, not a reproduction,\\" he offered. \\"We take the raw material of life and refine it into something greater.\\" As weeks turned to months, the marble began to reflect the glow of life beneath its polished surface. The statue stood confidently, a vision of genetic pride, echoing the ideology of the time. When the day came to unveil the finished work, Tom looked upon the sculpture, a mixture of admiration and unsettled feeling in the pit of his stomach. The marble effigy was grander than life, its eyes carved to an impossible depth that seemed to capture a soul of its own. \\"It's extraordinary,\\" Tom admitted, his voice tinged with a strange sorrow. \\"It's like looking at a stranger who knows everything about you.\\" Klaus simply nodded, knowing his work was not merely a reflection of the man but a vessel for the new world's aspirations. In the whispers of the studio, the sculptor sensed both the triumph and tragedy of capturing perfection, immortalizing an ideal that was neither fully Tom nor fully real, but a symbol forever etched in marble and time."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed story set in a universe where Germany won WWII about an artist making a painting of Tom Holland due to his Anglo-Saxon ethnicity.

Art had become a tool for propaganda, and artists were commissioned mainly to glorify the ideals of the Aryan race. Among this distorted reality, where darkness loomed and liberty was a mere whisper from the past, there was a studio bathed in a dim golden hue, lined with paintings that bore witness to the world's heavy chains. Within this studio, an artist named Friedrich was preparing his palette for a piece commissioned by the new regime authorities. They had chosen an English subject, an actor by the name of Tom Holland, to be immortalized due to his Anglo-Saxon looks which they found fitting to their narratives. The studio was an eclectic mix of old-world charm and stark utilitarian efficiency. Paints, brushes, and various other tools of the trade lay meticulously arranged on a vintage table. At the center stood an imposing easel, waiting for its next subject to come to life on canvas. Tom entered the studio, a young man with a bright face that starkly contrasted the somber atmosphere of the surrounded world. \\"Mr. Holland, if you please,\\" Friedrich gestured to the platform where Tom was to pose. Nervous yet committed, Tom nodded and undressed, revealing a physique that was toned but not overly muscular—a dancer's body, one could say, with strong definition but not sacrificing agility or grace. His skin was fair, barely touched by the sun, a smooth canvas itself. In this alternative universe, even the mere act of disrobing for art was an act of rebellion, a silent statement that despite the world outside, the human form was not to be solely claimed by the ideologies of tyrants. As Friedrich began to sketch the outlines of Tom's form onto the canvas, the musculature and sinews appeared with each confident stroke. Shadows and light danced across the subject's physique, and the artist captured them with a deft hand. During the process, the statue—a figure of marble strength yet undeniably human with an air that whispered both vulnerability and resilience—slowly emerged. It was an embodiment of the natural human form, untainted by war's impositions. Tom squinted occasionally, attempting to catch a glimpse of the work in progress, but the positioning of the easel shielded the painting from his full view. As they worked, an unexpected camaraderie developed. Tom stood still, but his mind was abuzz with curiosity. \\"So, Friedrich,\\" Tom began, his voice breaking the silence, \\"how did you end up with a brush in your hand in this, well, new world we inhabit?\\" The artist dipped his brush and pondered the question. \\"I believe art endures, Mr. Holland, even when the world is unrecognizable. We cling to what feels true.\\" Tom gave a small, understanding smile. \\"I know what you mean. For me, it's acting. Or at least it was. Telling stories, becoming other people... there's power in that, isn't there?\\" \\"There is,\\" Friedrich agreed, his focus never straying far from the canvas. \\"Art in any form carries the spirit of freedom. No matter how much they try to contain it.\\" They spoke of their pasts. Friedrich lamented lost freedoms, while Tom spoke of a world where he once played for the camera without fear. They shared an unspoken bond, realizing they were both kindred spirits adrift in a world that no longer made sense, finding moments of solace in the shared act of creation. Hours passed, shadows shifted, and upon completion, as Friedrich stepped back to regard the finished painting, Tom finally beheld the representation of himself. It was an uncanny reflection, both vulnerable and defiant, somehow capturing the essence of his spirit. Tom was taken aback by the detail, the life present in the eyes that stared back at him from the canvas. \\"It's remarkable,\\" Tom breathed out, almost in disbelief. \\"You've... well, you've really seen me.\\" Friedrich allowed himself a rare smile. \\"And you've reminded me what it is to portray truth, Mr. Holland. Despite it all.\\" In that moment, standing in the studio that seemed to exist outside of time, the painting was a silent protest, a small victory—a representation of human dignity and the enduring spirit of creativity, kept alive against the backdrop of a world where they had almost been forgotten."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed story set in a universe where Germany won WWII about an artist making a painting of Tom Holland due to his Anglo-Saxon ethnicity.

Cultural dominion spread as wide as their military might, infusing every aspect of life with the supremacist ideologies that once seethed within closed borders. Now, in an eerie semblance of peace, the repressive regime sought to immortalize its vision of human perfection through the arts. Enter Friedrich Adler, an artist of exceptional renown, tasked by the regime to capture the essence of Aryan beauty. Friedrich's studio was a spacious, high-ceiled room awash with the northern light that filtered through a massive skylight – a luxury granted by his favor with the state. The walls, once barren, now adorned with canvases that held the haunting, icy gaze of the pure-blooded lineage. On a crisp morning in early Spring, a subject of interest arrived at Friedrich's studio – Tom Holland, famed not just for his skill as an actor prolific within the Reich-approved cinematic circles, but also for his embodiment of the Anglo-Saxon attributes exalted by the regime. Initially reticent, Tom had acquiesced to pose for Friedrich, understanding the political undertones of such a portrait. As he was ushered into the studio, Tom was taken aback by the swathes of red and black drapes that contrasted starkly against the pristine white marble flooring. Friedrich greeted him cordially, his voice bearing the slight rasp of a man who had long replaced outdoor endeavors with the solitude that art demanded. \\"Welcome, Tom,\\" Friedrich said, offering a handshake. \\"I trust you've been briefed on the nature of today's session?\\" Tom nodded. \\"Yes, though I must admit I'm a bit nervous about the, erm, lack of attire.\\" Friedrich chuckled softly. \\"Understandable, but I assure you, it’s a common practice in the world of fine art. Your physique, much like the classical statues of Antiquity, represents an ideal. Today, you are an emblem of heritage itself.\\" With that, Tom disrobed, his form revealed as he stepped onto the raised platform, flanked by curtains. His physique was that of a dancer — lithe, with a defined musculature that spoke of rigorous training rather than brute strength. A faint scar crossed his side, a remnant of an old performance stunt gone awry, adding a unique narrative to his skin. Friedrich’s practiced gaze took in every contour, capturing the intimate details in his mind before transferring them onto canvas. As the bristles of his brush met the stretch of linen, a form began to manifest; the sweep of Tom's chest, the gentle curve of his abdomen, and the poised balance of his limbs were all rendered with meticulous attention. The painting, even in its incomplete state, carried an earnest vitality, the artist's skill infusing each stroke with breath. Throughout the hours, as the artist painted and the actor posed, a dialogue unfolded between the two. \\"How do you reconcile with these...expanded horizons of yours, Friedrich?\\" Tom inquired during a break, gesturing to the distinctly Germanic tones interwoven into the painting's backdrop. Friedrich paused, the question prompting a rare frown to crease his brow. \\"I paint what is asked of me, Tom. But within each piece, I strive to capture something truer, more human. Sometimes I believe I'm painting the world not as it is, but as how it still could be.\\" \\"And acting?\\" Friedrich returned the question, changing the subject. \\"Does it not chafe, wearing roles threaded with ideology?\\" \\"Sacrifices are often the making of an actor,\\" Tom mused. \\"Yet even within the lines they write for us, we can breathe life into the unspoken. Rebellion, I’ve found, takes many forms.\\" When the portrait neared completion, reflection glimmered in Tom's eyes as he beheld his own image wrought in oils. The man on the canvas held himself with a quiet defiance, a testament to the unseen resistance that simmered beneath the surface. Tom was silent a moment before speaking. \\"It's strange. To see oneself through another's eyes... You've given me a power I'm not sure I possess.\\" Friedrich cleaned his brush, considering the youth before him. \\"You possess it, Tom. It is merely waiting for the right moment to emerge.\\" As twilight cast its glow, their conversation ebbed to a close, touching on lighter memories of family and aspirations unbound by the world's twisted state. Together, artist and muse carved out a sanctuary where, if only for a while, ideals of a bygone era and hopes for a brighter future could coexist."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

The Task: Can you give me a small comment like a redditor for this reddit post, research things inside the post if necessary to support your knowledge:\\" Your opinion on Feynman saying computer Science is more engineering, than science? \\"Computer science also differs from physics in that it is not actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Tamiko Thiel/WikiCommons (CC BY-SA 3.0) Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint By Tom Siegfried May 11, 2018 at 6:00 am As Richard Feynman once said, “a man cannot live beyond the grave,” and so surely Feynman could not speak from the grave, either. Except that actually, he did. For years after his death in 1988, books appeared with collections of Feynman’s articles, talks and other miscellaneous writings. Together with his two autobiographical books and his famous lectures on physics, those works offer an enormous corpus of wisdom, advice, opinion and insight into nature, science, life and society. His words are widely quoted, and in fact his most noteworthy quotations fill up a fat book edited by his daughter Michelle, The Quotable Feynman (Princeton University Press, 2015). You could read that whole book if you like, of course. But if you’re short on time, you could just peruse the Top 10 Feynman Quotes below, selected from his works to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Feynman’s birth on May 11. (At least they’re my favorite 10. He might have ranked them differently.) 10. “If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis … that all things are made of atoms — little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.” From the famous Feynman Lectures on Physics, this statement exemplifies Feynman’s gift for distilling the essence from complicated science and expressing it colloquially. His words really ought to be inscribed somewhere in a permanent form, just in case. 9. “There is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.” A further expression of the importance of atoms from the opening pages of Feynman’s lectures. If anyone still disagrees with this sentiment, they should watch Westworld. 8. “For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.” This statement was Feynman’s succinct way of telling NASA to clean up its act after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. 7. “From my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence.” In a set of lectures compiled in book form as The Character of Physical Law, Feynman discussed scientific exploration as not seeking certainty, or proving some things impossible, but identifying what is probable. Flying saucers are possible, but are not therefore likely to exist; they are much more probably figments of overactive human imaginations (or deliberate attempts at deception). 6. “Most likely anything that you think of that is possible isn’t true. In fact that’s a general principle in physics theories: no matter what a guy thinks of, it’s almost always false.” From another series of lectures, compiled as The Meaning of It All, in which Feynman expanded on the probabilistic nature of scientific knowledge. Many more things are possible than reality can accommodate; statistically, therefore, most possibilities are actually not true. That explains why so much that so many people say is so wrong. 5. “What is necessary ‘for the very existence of science,’ and what the characteristics of nature are, are not to be determined by pompous preconditions, they are determined always by the material with which we work, by nature herself.” Also from The Character of Physical Law, this Feynman sentiment should remind scientists blinded by philosophical predispositions that defining “science” is not up to people, whether lexicographers or philosophers. Nature writes the rules. Science is the process of finding out what its own rules need to be to decipher the rules for the universe that nature has written. 4. “There’s plenty of room at the bottom.” This simple statement was the title of a talk Feynman delivered in 1959, widely regarded today as the original inspiration for the origin of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Feynman recognized that miniaturization in recording information was limited only by the size of atoms, and he even imagined that atoms could someday be manipulated individually. And they have been. 3. “Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical.” Feynman wasn’t the first to consider the idea of a quantum computer, but his words (from a 1981 talk, published in 1982) inspired some physicists to take the idea seriously. Feynman had no idea how to actually build a quantum computer, and serious work on real designs didn’t begin until the late 1990s. Today’s primitive versions of quantum computers can solve some simple problems and may soon be able to outperform standard computers on some types of problems, many experts believe. And perhaps such computers will, in fact, be able to simulate how nature works. (By the way, this statement is misquoted in The Quotable Feynman. As Feynman would have advised, always check things out for yourself.) 2. “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” As Feynman said in The Character of Physical Law, many people understand other sophisticated physical theories, including Einstein’s relativity. But quantum mechanics resists an equivalent depth of understanding. Some disagree, proclaiming that they understand quantum mechanics perfectly well. But their understanding disagrees with the supposed understanding of others, equally knowledgeable. Perhaps Feynman’s sentiment might better be expressed by saying that anyone who claims to understand quantum mechanics, doesn’t. 1. “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.” The best Feynman quote of all (from a 1974 address), and the best advice to scientists and anybody else who seeks the truth about the world. The truth may not be what you’d like it to be, or what would be best for you, or what your preconceived philosophy tells you that it is. Unless you recognize how easily you can be fooled, you will be. Follow me on Twitter: @tom_siegfried Questions or comments on this article?

His perspective encourages a multi-disciplinary approach, harnessing physics for hardware, biology for neural networks, and beyond, to avoid the 'local maximum' of progress.

The second loop (line 3) runs from 1 to n⌊log_2 n⌋, so it has n⌊log_2 n⌋ iterations. The third loop (line 4) runs from 2j+5 to 2j+8, which is 4 iterations, since it’s independent of n. Therefore, the total running time is: T(n) = n * n⌊log_2 n⌋ * 4 We can simplify this by removing the floor function since it only affects lower order terms: T(n) ≈ n^2 * log_2(n) * 4 The complexity is O(n^2 log n). # Func2(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← 1 to 10⌊n^0.5⌋ do 3. for j ← 1 to i^2 do 4. s ← s + i - j; 5. end 6. end 7. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs for 10⌊n^0.5⌋ iterations. The second loop (line 3) depends on i and runs for i^2 iterations. We can represent it as: T(n) = ∑[i=1 to 10⌊n^0.5⌋] ∑[j=1 to i^2] 1 Simplifying, we get a series summing the squares of the first 10⌊n^0.5⌋ natural numbers. The upper bound is (10n^0.5)^2, so the overall complexity is O(n). # Func3(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← 1 to 2n^4 do 3. for j ← 5i^2+1 to 7i^2 do 4. for k ← 3 to 10 do 5. s ← s + i - j + k; 6. end 7. end 8. end 9. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs 2n^4 times. The second loop (line 3) is based on i^2 and runs for roughly 2i^2 iterations (7i^2 - 5i^2). The third loop (line 4) has a constant number of iterations (8). T(n) = ∑[i=1 to 2n^4] ∑[j=5i^2+1 to 7i^2] 8 Simplifying, the inner sum is a constant times the square of i (2i^2), so the total is: T(n) ≈ 8 * ∑[i=1 to 2n^4] 2i^2 The summation of i^2 from 1 to 2n^4 leads to a complexity O(n^8). # Func4(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← 2 to 2n^3 do 3. for j ← 3 to 4i^2⌊log_2 i⌋ do 4. s ← s + i - j; 5. end 6. end 7. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs for 2n^3 iterations. The second loop (line 3) depends on i^2 and the logarithm of i. Even though we have a logarithm, the i^2 term will dominate. Assume the upper bound for the inner loop is O(i^2⌊log_2 i⌋), which is O(i^2 log i) because i^2 grows faster than log i. T(n) = ∑[i=2 to 2n^3] O(i^2 log i) This is not trivial to simplify, but an approximation considering that i^2 log i is the dominating term and log i changes slower than i, we might assume it behaves similar to: T(n) ≈ O(n^9 log n) The complexity appears to be O(n^9 log n). # Func5(n) 1. s ← 0; 2. for i ← n to 2n^2-1 do 3. for j ← 1 to i^3 do 4. s ← s + i - j; 5. end 6. end 7. return (s); The first loop (line 2) runs from n to 2n^2, so it has roughly n^2 iterations. The second loop runs for i^3 iterations for each i. We express this as: T(n) = ∑[i=n to 2n^2] i^3 This summation roughly behaves like the sum of cubes of the first 2n^2 natural numbers, so the dominant term is proportional to the fourth power of the upper limit, giving a total complexity: T(n) ≈ O((2n^2)^4) = O(16n^8) Simplifying the constant, the complexity is O(n^8).","completion":"As you have provided, we can denote the time complexities of the functions as follows: # Func1(n) For Func1, you have calculated it correctly. We have the total running time as: T(n) = n * n⌊log_2 n⌋ * 4 Simplifying it, the complexity is indeed O(n^2 log n) because the ⌊log_2 n⌋ term has a slower growth rate than the n^2 term, and the constant factor can be omitted in big-O notation. # Func2(n) For Func2, your explanation is also correct. The sum of squares of the first numbers up to 10⌊n^0.5⌋ can be approximated as O(n), due to the squaring of a square root of n (i.e., 10⌊n^0.5⌋^2 is linear in the order of n). # Func3(n) Func3's complexity is articulated well in your description. Considering the scale of the loops: T(n) = ∑[i=1 to 2n^4] ∑[j=5i^2+1 to 7i^2] 8 This simplifies to the time complexity of O(n^8), credited to the dominating n^4 term squared. # Func4(n) Your Func4 approximation to O(n^9 log n) is conceptually valid but needs a more cautious approach due to the combination of polynomial and logarithmic terms. Indeed, the i^2 log i term dominates the running time of the inner loop, but the big-O analysis should be more precise. The exact closed-form of the summation is non-trivial, but the complexity can be quantified as greater than O(n^6) (due to the 2n^3 outer loop) and potentially less than O(n^9 log n), depending on how the logarithm grows relative to the polynomial term. # Func5(n) Func5's loop runs from n to 2n^2 and has time complexity based on the sum of cubes: T(n) = ∑[i=n to 2n^2] i^3 This indeed sums up to a complexity of O(n^8), which follows from the behavior of cubed sums and considering the fourth power of the upper limit. In summary: Func1(n) = O(n^2 log n) Func2(n) = O(n) Func3(n) = O(n^8) Func4(n) = O(n^9 log n) (although this calculation may warrant a more detailed analysis) Func5(n) = O(n^8)"},{"prompt":"matriz eric - un resumen por cada punto muy breve","completion":"La matriz ERIC es una herramienta utilizada para ayudar en la toma de decisiones y en la gestión de ideas durante procesos de resolución de problemas o de lluvia de ideas.

The band is known for its aggressive music, energetic live performances, and distinctive image, particularly the masks and uniforms worn by its members. The name \\"Slipknot\\" itself does not have an official, single meaning that the band has confirmed, as different members have given various interpretations over the years. However, there are a couple of common interpretations: 1. **Unity Amongst Chaos**: The idea that the members are tied together like a knot, and while their music and performances are chaotic and intense, they are tightly bound together like the interlocking loops of a slipknot. The band's cohesion is reflected in the name, signifying their commitment to one another and the strength of their collective presence. 2. **A Symbol of Intransigence**: Slipknots are types of knots that tighten under tension and are difficult to untie, which could symbolize the band's resistance to conform to mainstream music or societal norms. Their music and persona embody a sense of rebellion and counterculture, which the name could reflect. It's also possible that the name simply sounded intriguing, fit the band's image, and did not necessarily carry a specific, intended meaning when it was chosen. The ambiguity and multiple potential interpretations add to the enigmatic nature of the band's brand, allowing fans to infer their own meanings from the name Slipknot."},{"prompt":"So what is the meaning of this word? Is this word made from band?","completion":"No, the word \\"slipknot\\" was not created by the band and it has its own meaning independent of the group. A slipknot is a type of knot that creates a loop that can easily tighten when you pull on the end of the rope or string. It is called a \\"slip\\" knot because the loop can \\"slip\\" or close when the standing end is pulled and it is easily adjustable. This type of knot has various practical uses, such as in fishing lines, knitting, or situations where a temporary stopper or easily-releasable knot is needed. The slipknot is renowned for its unique property of being able to be quickly tied and untied, particularly under load. The band Slipknot chose their name independently of the knot's functional use. The name resonates with the theme of binding and tension, as mentioned earlier, but the term itself predates the band and is a part of common nomenclature related to knots."},{"prompt":"selam","completion":"Selam!

Previously, a Google search was conducted to find relevant sources for Feynman's quotes and contextual information. A source from the Long Now Foundation titled 'Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine' has been used to attempt to draft an authentic Reddit comment. A Reddit-style comment was crafted and sent to the user, but the reaction indicates it did not meet expectations in terms of authenticity. To improve the response, I need to rephrase or reconstruct the comment to capture the conversational, direct, and informal tone typical of Reddit. This would involve incorporating colloquial language and possibly a personal anecdote or a rhetorical question to engage other users in the discussion. Since specific Reddit content cannot be accessed to tailor the comment to the ongoing discussion or the subreddit's style, the task will focus on general principles of Reddit communication to ensure the comment feels more genuine to the platform.\\", \\"reasoning\\": \\"To create a genuine Reddit comment, it is important to mirror the platform's characteristic language style, which is conversational and informal.

Si vous souhaitez que la liste se mette à jour après une action utilisateur (comme ajouter ou retirer une chanson), il y a plusieurs façons de le faire : 1. **Recharger la page** : après l'ajout ou la suppression d'une chanson, rediriger l'utilisateur vers la même page (ce que vous faites déjà avec \`header('Location: index.php?action=admin');\`). Assurez-vous que la base de données a été mise à jour avant le rechargement afin que les chansons ajoutées ou supprimées soient reflétées dans les listes déroulantes. 2. **Utiliser AJAX** : permet de mettre à jour le contenu de la page dynamiquement sans recharger la page complète. Vous pouvez utiliser des requêtes AJAX pour ajouter ou supprimer une chanson et mettre à jour les options dans les listes déroulantes en fonction de la réponse du serveur. # Traitement du formulaire Assurez-vous que votre formulaire soit correctement traité. Dans votre cas, le formulaire semble envoyer les informations à \`index.php?action=gerer_sons\`, mais il y a quelques points à vérifier : - Est-ce que \`index.php\` est configuré pour gérer l'action \`gerer_sons\` ? - Est-ce que les ID des chansons à ajouter ou à supprimer sont correctement récupérés et traités ? # Sécurité Votre code actuellement utilise bien la préparation des requêtes avec \`bindValue()\` pour la protection contre les injections SQL, ce qui est bon.

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company.nnRichard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT.nnI got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting.nnRichard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded.nnAfter a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems.nn\\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\"nnSo we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router.nnThe MachinennThe router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12} wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently.nnDuring those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper...n(This is an excerpt from the full essay.)\\" } }, \\"thoughts\\": { \\"text\\": \\"I’ve written the content from the ‘Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine’ essay into a file in order to make a plausible Reddit comment.

Granted that even though Tenochtitlan fell in 1521 nearly a world apart, even then, those like royalty and the military, officers or infantry/cavalry otherwise, were aware of this, just not everyone else back in Spain or Europe as a whole. The question, based on all of this, is how long did it take for information about the Americas and its indigenous population like the Aztecs and subsequent Maya and Inca, to fully become public knowledge, to the point that even lower class civilians such as merchants, farmers, laborers and more, would've known about it that it would be considered public knowledge?","completion":"The dissemination of information about the Americas and its indigenous populations such as the Aztecs, Maya, and Inca varied over time and across different social classes. It took several decades for information to gradually spread and become more widely known among the general public in Europe. Here's a rough timeline of how knowledge about the Americas progressed: 1. 1492-1520: Early accounts and official reports - After Christopher Columbus's voyages, early accounts of the Americas were circulated, including his own reports and those of other explorers like Amerigo Vespucci. These accounts, however, were primarily accessible to the ruling elite, scholars, and some merchants. 2. 1520s-1540s: Spanish conquest and royal court dissemination - During this period, the conquest of the Aztec Empire by Hernán Cortés and subsequent expeditions spread information about the Aztecs and other indigenous groups. Reports, letters, and chronicles were sent back to Spain and often read in royal courts. They sometimes reached the hands of influential individuals, intellectuals, and military personnel. 3. 1550s-1570s: Writings and chronicles - The publication of various written works and chronicles by conquistadors, missionaries, and travelers contributed to the wider dissemination of knowledge about the Americas. These publications, such as Bartolomé de las Casas's \\"History of the Indies,\\" reached a broader audience and provided detailed accounts of indigenous civilizations. 4. Late 16th century: Merchants and traders - As trade routes between Europe and the Americas expanded, merchants and traders began to gather first-hand knowledge of the indigenous populations they encountered. They would have shared this information with each other and their communities, slowly spreading awareness among lower-class civilians involved in overseas trade. 5. Late 16th century onwards: Popular culture and public knowledge - By the end of the 16th century, knowledge and awareness of the Americas and its indigenous civilizations had gradually seeped into popular culture. Artworks, literature, and plays began to depict and reference the Americas, contributing to a broader understanding among the general public. However, it's important to note that the level of knowledge and understanding among lower-class civilians would have varied significantly. Access to information was limited, and illiteracy was prevalent during this period, potentially limiting the reach of written sources. Additionally, oral accounts and storytelling might have played a role in transmitting information among communities. The full democratization of knowledge about the Americas likely took many decades, if not centuries, to occur."},{"prompt":"La formula principal del oceano azul es La innovación se produce cuando bajas los costos e incrementas el valor.

Esto se logra al reducir o eliminar factores que la industria da por sentados (bajar costos) y al mismo tiempo elevar otros que son importantes para el cliente (incrementar valor). Al hacer esto, las empresas pueden alcanzar tanto la diferenciación como bajos costos, permitiéndoles abrir un nuevo espacio de mercado que otras empresas aún no han explorado o explotado.

Before joining Slipknot, Taylor was the vocalist for another Des Moines, Iowa-based band, Stone Sour. He was approached by members of Slipknot after they were impressed by his performance and energy. Initially, Slipknot had a different vocalist, Anders Colsefni. However, as the band aimed to evolve their sound and move toward a more melodic but still aggressive music style, they felt the need for a new vocalist who could handle the range of vocal styles they wanted to incorporate into their music—from harsh screaming to melodic singing. Taylor's ability to deliver both styles made him an optimal choice. Taylor officially joined Slipknot in 1997, replacing Colsefni, and his inclusion in the band helped propel them to greater heights of success. His first album with the band was their self-titled debut, \\"Slipknot,\\" released in 1999, which went on to achieve major commercial success and was a launching pad for the unique image and sound that Slipknot is known for. In addition to his vocal talent, Taylor's dynamic personality and songwriting skills contributed to the band's growing popularity. His ability to connect with fans both on and off stage, through the themes of darkness, anger, and alienation present in the band's music, also played a significant role in his fit as Slipknot's frontman."},{"prompt":"Is it true that Corey Taylor became the Slipknot vocalist because Slipknot and StoneSour had a live match and StoneSour lost?","completion":"The story of Corey Taylor becoming Slipknot's vocalist as a result of a \\"live match\\" between Slipknot and Stone Sour where Stone Sour allegedly lost is not an accurate representation of how Taylor joined Slipknot. This narrative seems to be a conflation of events or a myth rather than a factual account of what happened. The truth is more straightforward: Corey Taylor was recruited by Slipknot due to his impressive vocal abilities and stage presence that he showcased while singing for Stone Sour. The members of Slipknot were looking to replace their original vocalist, Anders Colsefni, as they wanted someone with a greater vocal range who could handle both melodic singing and aggressive styles required for the band's evolving sound. Joey Jordison (Slipknot's drummer at the time) and other members were already aware of Taylor's talent and saw his potential to elevate their band's music. Taylor was approached and, after some deliberation, decided to join the band. His first album with Slipknot, the self-titled \\"Slipknot,\\" was released in 1999 and cemented his role as the band's frontman. There was no competition or battle of the bands scenario that determined his position in Slipknot. The decision was based on mutual interest and the belief that Taylor's addition to Slipknot would greatly benefit the band's future success."},{"prompt":"But it would have been hard to understand it at Stone Sour","completion":"If you're referring to how Corey Taylor's departure from Stone Sour to join Slipknot would have been perceived by the members of Stone Sour, it may indeed have been a complex situation initially. Such transitions can be challenging for any band to navigate, especially when one of its members leaves or joins another project that may become their primary focus. At the time when Taylor joined Slipknot, Stone Sour was still a developing band, whereas Slipknot was on the verge of breaking out into the mainstream. Taylor's decision to join Slipknot may have involved considerations about where he could best use his talents and which opportunity had the most significant potential for growth and success in the music industry. It's worth noting that Stone Sour was not entirely left behind; rather, it went on hiatus. The band was re-formed later, in 2002, and has since coexisted alongside Slipknot. Corey Taylor has fulfilled his role as the lead vocalist for both bands, managing to balance his commitments and maintain an active presence in both groups. Ultimately, both Slipknot and Stone Sour have benefited from Corey Taylor's involvement, and fans of both bands have experienced a wide range of musical styles because of Taylor's versatile vocal capabilities."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Archibald was a man of impressive corpulence, decorated with a mustache that twisted like the vineyards of Tuscany, and a zest for painting that eclipsed his penchant for afternoon teas and scones. It was on this whimsical afternoon that young Tom Holland, known for his spider-like agility and charming boyish grin, had mistakenly wandered into Archibald's studio. Looking for his yoga class, Tom found himself amidst a labyrinth of bizarre canvases and a stark-naked Greek statue striking a pose with an expression that suggested he'd seen too much. \\"Ah, Mr. Holland! Splendid timing!\\" Archibald clapped his pudgy hands with glee. \\"I was just about to embark on my latest masterpiece centered on the forgotten tales of Anglo-Saxon heroes!\\" Tom, puzzled yet always game for an adventure, replied with a smirk, \\"You mean like Beowulf? I'm no warrior, Archie, just a guy who pretends to fight bad guys on screen.\\" \\"Nonsense! You have the spirit of an ancient chieftain! But there is one tiny requirement,\\" Archibald's eyes twinkled with mischief. Moments later, following a bewildering conversation, Tom stood in the center of the studio, as nude as the day he was born, striking an unassuming heroic pose, inappropriate wispy curls of hair tastefully omitted. \\"Are uh, you sure about this, Archie?\\" Tom sheepishly inquired, as he tried to emulate the stoicism of the statues around him. \\"Naturally! Your Anglo-Saxon physiology is astoundingly authentic for the arts, my boy. Quite... spartan!\\" Archibald's eyes danced across Tom's figure, as he unintentionally flexed out of nervous habit, revealing more of a modern dancer's musculature than an ancient warrior's. \\"Alright, just don't make my bum look big, yeah?\\" Tom joked, trying to ease the blush of modesty climbing up his cheeks. \\"Each stroke of my brush captures essence, not excess,\\" the artist retorted with a wink, as he began slathering swathes of color onto the canvas. Throughout the session, the two engaged in lighthearted banter. \\"So, Tom, swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper, what's that like?\\" Archibald inquired, squinting an eye while adding a delicate touch of rose madder to the embryonic cheeks of the Tom on his canvas. \\"It's a bit like this, actually. Uncomfortably exposed and hoping not to fall,\\" Tom mused, fine-tuning his stance. \\"But seriously, it's quite fun, even if it's all movie magic.\\" The painting slowly morphed into a comically dignified marvel. Tom was depicted with a mix of bold virility and the soft edges of a modern-day Prince Charming. His skin was colored in various shades of earnest peach and warrior bronze, his eyes a piercing blue that sang of Anglo-Saxon shores. At the grand revealing, Tom stepped toward the canvas, initially stunned by the imagery. Under the laughter, a hint of awe struck him. There he was, immortalized like a figure from an old legend, absurdly noble against an anachronistic backdrop of Wi-Fi signals and double-decker buses. \\"Archie, I... I don't know what to say! It's... something,\\" Tom chuckled, gazing at his exaggeratedly angular jawline, dramatically flexed arms, and an oddly poignant fig leaf placed for modern decency. \\"Is this really what you think of when you hear 'Anglo-Saxon'?\\" Tom asked, quirking an eyebrow but unable to suppress a broad grin. \\"Well, not exactly,\\" Archibald admitted with a hearty chortle. \\"But every brushstroke is an exploration, Thomas. And you, my dear lad, are now an explorer in the whimsical sea of art!\\" Both men laughed heartily as they shook hands, knowing this would be one of those curious tales that neither would ever forget. Tom clothed himself once more, the dignity of his modern attire clashing with the recent memory of ancestral emulation. The painting, titled \\"The Anachronistic Anglo-Saxon Ascendant,\\" would eventually find itself in an obscure gallery, leaving onlookers to ponder the remarkable blend of history, humor, and Tom Holland's unexpected day as a nude model."},{"prompt":"Make a comedic and vividly detailed story about an artist making a painting of Tom Holland due to his Anglo ethnicity.

Add casual dialogue between the artist and Tom throughout, chatting about their lives","completion":"Preface: This narrative is fictional and comedic in nature, taking creative liberties for the sake of humor. It's important to respect individuals' privacy and consent, and in reality, such a circumstance would certainly unfold with the understanding and agreement of all parties involved. --- In the heart of a bohemian London quarter, a rather eccentric painter named Reginald Fancypants the Third had been commissioned to create the most improbable of works: a portrait of Tom Holland—yes, the very Spider-Man himself—gracing canvas in the buff! As Tom slinked into the flamboyantly adorned studio with walls awash in colors that could provoke envy in a rainbow, he was met with a sight to behold. Pots of pantomime paints intruded every corner, and half-finished portraits of dignified chihuahuas in Victorian garb gazed down upon him from walls festooned with antique frames. Reginald, a man whose mustache curled with the verve of his personality, greeted Tom with an exuberance typically reserved for lottery winners, \\"Welcome, my lad! Today, we shall immortalize your Anglo pizzazz!\\" Tom, ever the sport and a tad anxious, chuckled, \\"Well, Reg, I've done action shots, not... art nudes. But hey, how many times do life and art intersect, right?\\" With that, Tom disrobed, revealing a physique less Greek god, more 'mildly superpowered neighborhood friend.' There were no thunderous biceps or mountainous pecs. Instead, a lean canvas of a kindhearted hero, a frame fit for swinging between skyscrapers rather than carving them. \\"Ah, an authentic human form!\\" Reginald exclaimed, eyes sparkling, \\"A refreshing change from my usual, beer-bellied bankers looking to glorify their girth.\\" As Tom perched somewhat awkwardly on a velvet chaise lounge, strategically positioned fruits—which might have preferred a quiet life in a bowl—ensured that the painting would remain just shy of scandalous. Reginald, palette in hand like an alchemist of oils, set to work. The painting took on life; a somewhat abstract form of Tom began to emerge. Brushstrokes danced with wild abandon, splattering Tom's down-to-earth essence into a semblance of heroism and hilarity. \\"Tell me, Tom,\\" Reginald asked while mixing a couleur de 'English Rose' for those uniquely Holland-esque cheeks, \\"how does one prepare for slinging webs? Yoga? Pilates? Or is it all CGI and pies?\\" \\"Mostly stunt training and avoiding pies,\\" Tom replied with a smirk, \\"though I wouldn't say no to a good shepherd's pie.\\" The dialogue continued; tales of high-flying set blunders to Reginald's disastrous attempt at online dating intermingled with the smell of linseed oil and tomfoolery. Hours later, as the final touch of an expertly articulated curl to Tom's imagination was set into motion, Reginald stepped back, tossed his beret into the air (missing the hat stand entirely), and declared, \\"Voilà!\\" Tom gingerly wrapped a robe around himself and approached the easel. His eyes widened; the figure on the canvas bore his resemblance, certainly, but with limbs just slightly too long and a devious glint in the eyes that suggested this Spider-Man might spin trickster's tales rather than webs. \\"Well, that's certainly a version of me,\\" Tom laughed, admiring the characterization, \\"Should we call it 'Holland in Hyperbole?'\\" \\"More like 'The Farce from Another Universe',\\" Reginald quipped. Both gazed at the painting with a mix of awe and amusement, realizing that while art is meant to capture reality, it often reveals the hilarity hiding within humanity. With a day well spent and self-seriousness left at the door, they parted as unlikely friends—united in artistic jest and the peculiar fraternity of those who dare to bare their souls (amongst other things) to the canvas of life."},{"prompt":"Make a comedic and vividly detailed story about an artist making a rear view painting of Tom Holland due to his Anglo-Saxon ethnicity.

Upon Tom's arrival at the studio, Ignatius greeted him with a chuckle and a flamboyant wave of his paint-stained hand. \\"Ah, Master Holland, ready to let your ancestors shine from, um, behind?\\" Tom chuckled, his boyish grin lighting up the dimly-lit studio. He was unusually nonchalant for a young A-lister about to bare it all. \\"Well, Ignatius, they say go back to your roots,\\" Tom quipped, disregarding the robe offered to him and diving into the experience with the confidence of a superhero. \\"Might as well start with me bum, yeah?\\" Ignatius marveled at Tom’s physical condition while he stretched and tuned his physique like a fine instrument. He had the finely tuned body of an acrobat—muscles knit firmly together, as if his tendons were spun from the webbing of his cinematic alter ego. His skin was a tapestry of dedication, reflecting a discipline that included the odd cheeky British pastry. The artist started sketching, swiping broad strokes across the canvas with a flourish. \\"Hold that pose, my good man. Your glutes will be the very emblem of Anglo-Saxon pride, won't they?\\" The canvas began to fill, as did the studio with light-hearted banter. The first brushstrokes created a gentle outline that soon bloomed into rolling hills of flesh—a whimsical tribute to the undulating English countryside. The color palette ranged from a battle-ready bronze to the gentle, sunrise peach of Dawn's first light on Stonehenge. As the painting progressed, Tom ambled about in the brief interludes, unabashed in his natural state. \\"You know, Ignatius, if this acting gig ever dries up, I could join one of those nudist colonies. I'm quite enjoying the breeze.\\" Ignatius, laughing, replied with earnest amusement, \\"Tom, I believe you could start a whole new movement. The 'Hollandist Nudists' does have a certain ring to it.\\" Time slipped away as they shared tales. Tom spoke of his time on set, the shenanigans with fellow actors, and the thrill of the stuntwork. Ignatius mused about the eccentricities of the art world, the misunderstood genius of his pug portraits, and his three-legged cat named Monet. The session wore on, and the sun dipped low, spilling a golden hue through the studio's skylights. It was now time for the grand reveal. With a flair for the dramatic, Ignatius turned the canvas around. Tom was awestruck by his own robust depiction framed by two cheeky cherubs cheekily prodding his muscular Thor-like backside with tiny Anglo-Saxon swords. \\"I'm flattered, I think,\\" Tom scratched his head. \\"It's definitely got a lot of, um, character.\\" Ignatius stood back, his head tilting like a proud peacock. \\"Indeed. It captures a proud lineage, from the arch of your back to the—how shall I say—the 'stalwart defiance' of your haunches.\\" Tom snorted with laughter. \\"My ancestors would be proud. Or mortified. Either way, it's hard to tell with this much... exposition.\\" A chuckle-filled toast of wine ended the evening—a painter, his muse, and the world's most valiant Anglo-Saxon rear view sealed into the annals of art history with a shared moment of mirth and a very cheeky painting."},{"prompt":"youtube shorts için cengizhan hakkında 45 saniyelik bir hikaye yaz","completion":"Cengizhan, gözüpek bir Türk savaşçısıydı.

Tom enters the studio and undresses, posing for the painting in the nude. Describe his physique. Describe how the painting looks during the process. Describe Tom’s reaction to the painting. Add casual dialogue between the artist and Tom throughout, chatting about their lives.","completion":"Once upon a time in a quirky artist's loft nestled in the heart of bustling London, there lived a fantastically flamboyant gay painter named Sebastian Sparks. Sebastian had a fervent love for three things: vibrant colors, handsome British men, and a touch of the theatrics. His art was wild, audacious, and often cheeky—in every sense of the word. Now, our dear Sebastian had a particular infatuation with one British chap above all—none other than the spellbindingly supple crusader of cinema, Tom Holland. Sebastian's dream, which he once thought was as far-fetched as a pig pirouetting in a tutu, was about to come true. For today, Tom was to be his muse, and his derrière was to be immortalized on canvas. As the sun beamed through the stained-glass windows of the studio, casting rainbows on the walls, in sauntered Tom, his smile as bright as his Spider-Man suit. Sebastian nearly choked on his chamomile tea, as if hit by webs of disbelief. \\"Ello, Sebastian! Ready to make some art?\\" chirped Tom, a twinkle in his eye. Sebastian cleared his throat, quickly regaining his composure. \\"My dear, you are art,\\" he replied, a smirk playing on his lips. With a sheepish grin, Tom Holland proceeded to undress. The room was suddenly filled with an air of expectancy as Tom revealed the canvas of his physique—a symphony of taut muscles and skin smoother than a freshly primed painter's gesso. His shoulders were broad, arms toned with the strength of a web-slinger, and his back tapered down to the pièce de résistance, a tush as sculpted as a Greek statue. Sebastian wasted no time. As the bristles of his brush met the canvas, the room shimmered with creativity. The painting started to form—a blend of majestic purples and sheddings of sunset orange framing the curves of Tom's spellbinding back. Hues of forest green and cobalt blue played in the shadows, while the star of the show—Tom's rear—was rendered with rosy, tender strokes, capturing the light and essence of British charm. Throughout this artistic endeavor, the banter between muse and painter was as vivid as the paint on the palette. \\"So, Tom, tell me about your latest adventures swinging through the city,\\" Sebastian mused, a dab of crimson on his cheek. \\"Well, Sebastian, between saving grannies and chasing pigeons, it's all in a day's work for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,\\" Tom quipped back, waggling his eyebrows. Sebastian chuckled. \\"And here I thought the most exciting part of my day was mixing Prussian Blue with Titanium White.\\" Hours swirled by like strokes on the canvas. Eventually, Sebastian stepped back, a dramatic flourish signaling the completion of his rear-view masterpiece. Tom wrapped a velvet robe around his waist and approached the easel with trepidation. His eyes widened, and his mouth formed an awed 'O.' \\"Sebastian, it's—well, it's sensational!\\" Tom exclaimed, almost giggling at the sight of his own bum blossoming in oil paint glory. \\"You've given my backside more character development than most scripts I've read!\\" They both erupted into laughter, the studio echoing with the sound of pure mirth. \\"My darling boy,\\" Sebastian said, \\"I believe this calls for a celebration. Shall we toast to British bottoms and the hands that adore them?\\" With that, they clinked teacups—a toast to art, humor, and the unexpected bonds formed in perhaps the most unusual of circumstances."},{"prompt":"Write a story about a race of human-shaped jelly creatures","completion":"Once upon a time, in a land not too far away, there existed a remote and mystical jelly kingdom. Here, a race of extraordinary beings called Jellyphiles lived. These were not your ordinary jellies; they were human-shaped jelly creatures with striking colors and magical abilities. The Jellyphiles were a peaceful and harmonious community, living together in unity and love. Each Jellyphile had a unique color and texture, ranging from the glistening Goldenglows to the ethereal Aquanebulas. Their magical powers varied too; some could change shape at will, others could produce sweet melodies from within themselves, and a few had the remarkable ability to heal others with their gentle touch. One particular Jellyphile named Jella was known for her translucent, shimmering body. Jella was kindhearted and full of curiosity. She often ventured into the enchanted forests surrounding their kingdom, discovering hidden wonders and befriending the magical creatures that resided there. Her closest friends were Twinko, the dancing firefly, and Breezy, a mischievous forest sprite. One day, while Jella was exploring a crystal-clear lake deep within the forest, she noticed a strange phenomenon. The water began to ripple, and as she looked closer, Jella saw a reflection of what appeared to be another Jellyphile on the surface. Excited and curious, she leaped into the water and discovered an enchanting underwater world. This new world was bustling with life. Jella swam gracefully through coral reefs, encountering vibrant aquatic creatures that had never seen a Jellyphile before. They were amazed by her shimmering appearance and asked her to stay as their honored guest. Jella happily obliged, spending her days exploring the depths, learning the ways of underwater life, and teaching the creatures about the wonders of the surface world. However, as time passed, Jella longed to return to her beloved Jellyphile kingdom and share her newfound knowledge and experiences. She bid farewell to her aquatic friends, promising to visit them again, and resurfaced in the realm of trees and sunlight. To her surprise, Jella found that her absence had caused worry among her fellow Jellyphiles. They had celebrated her unique qualities and missed her radiant presence. Jella shared her tales of the underwater world, captivating everyone with her vivid descriptions and enthusing them about the wonders that awaited beyond their borders. Inspired by Jella's adventures, the Jellyphiles decided to explore the world outside their kingdom. They discovered breathtaking landscapes, encountered other unique beings, and formed connections beyond their wildest imaginations. The Jellyphiles' presence brought joy wherever they went, spreading love and harmony throughout the lands they touched. From that day on, the Jellyphiles embraced their uniqueness and used their magical abilities to bring happiness and healing to those in need. They became the embodiment of empathy, reminding others of the beauty and diversity that exists in this world. And they lived in harmony with the creatures around them, sharing their love, their wisdom, and their remarkable jelly-like existence. And so, the Jellyphiles became a celebrated part of the realm, their vibrancy and magic intertwining with the fabric of creation. They taught the world that even in a kingdom made of jelly, where the boundaries between form and fluidity blurred, what truly mattered was the kindness and love that resided within."},{"prompt":"Did guns exist in John Locke's time?","completion":"Yes, guns did exist during John Locke's time. John Locke lived from 1632 to 1704, which means he lived through the final phases of the Renaissance and into the early Enlightenment. By the time Locke was born, firearms had already been in use for several centuries in various forms. Hand-held firearms, like the arquebus and the musket, were being used by the 15th and 16th centuries. By the 17th century, when Locke was alive, these firearms had become more advanced and widespread. Moreover, the development of the flintlock mechanism in the early 1600s made firearms more reliable and easier to use. Locke's writings on political philosophy, particularly concerning the right to self-defense and property, are often interpreted within the context of a society where individuals had access to such weapons for personal and military use. Lockean principles have even been cited in discussions about gun ownership rights in later centuries, especially in the context of the United States' Second Amendment."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Mach Vorschläge.","completion":"Als KI kann ich keinen vollständigen Code hier erstellen oder deployen, aber ich kann dir ein grundlegendes Konzept für eine solche Anwendung anbieten. Es gibt mehrere Ansätze, um unterbewertete Aktien zu identifizieren, die viel Wachstumspotenzial haben, und du kannst verschiedene Methoden kombinieren, um deine Suchkriterien zu verfeinern. Hier ist eine allgemeine Struktur, die du als Ausgangspunkt verwenden kannst: 1. Festlegen der Auswahlkriterien: - Fundamentalanalyse: P/E-Verhältnis, P/B-Verhältnis, Dividendenrendite, Gewinnwachstum, Schuldenquote, freier Cashflow u.a. - Technische Analyse: Trendfolgende Indikatoren, Momentum-Indikatoren, historische Volatilität, u.a. - Analystenbewertungen und -empfehlungen. - News Sentiment Analyse: Bewertung von Nachrichten und Berichten, die positiv oder negativ sein könnten. 2. Datenquellen: - Börsendaten-Anbieter wie Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud oder ein anderer kostenpflichtiger Anbieter. - Nachrichten und Social-Media-APIs für Sentiment-Analysen. 3. Entwicklungsumgebung und Tools: - Eine Programmiersprache wie Python mit Bibliotheken wie Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn für Datenanalyse und maschinelles Lernen. - Jupyter Notebook oder andere IDEs für die Entwicklung und das Testen von Scripts. 4. Programmierung des Algorithmus: - Datenbeschaffung: Verwenden der besagten APIs, um die notwendigen Daten zu erhalten. - Datenverarbeitung: Reinigen und Normieren der Daten, um sie vergleichbar zu machen. - Analyse: Implementierung von Finanzkennzahlen-Berechnungen und Anwendung von maschinellem Lernen, um Muster und Trends zu erkennen. - Filter: Definition und Anwendung von Filtern basierend auf den oben genannten Kriterien zur Ermittlung potenzieller Kandidaten. - Ergebnisauswertung: Darstellung der gefilterten Ergebnisse und vielleicht Aufforderung zur manuellen Überprüfung. 5. User Interface: - Entwicklung einer Benutzeroberfläche, z.B. mit Streamlit, Dash oder einer Web-Frontend-Technologie, um Benutzern zu ermöglichen, Kriterien einzugeben und Ergebnisse zu durchsuchen. 6. Backtesting und Evaluation: - Integrierung einer Backtesting-Funktion, um die Effektivität deiner Strategie anhand historischer Daten zu testen. - Anpassung der Parameter und Algorithmen auf Grundlage der Backtesting-Ergebnisse. Bitte beachte, dass dies nur ein hochgradiges Konzept ist. Die Implementierung eines solchen Systems erfordert umfangreiche Fachkenntnisse in den Bereichen Finanzanalyse, Programmierung und Datenanalyse. Darüber hinaus gelten für den Zugang zu und die Verwendung von Finanzdaten oft rechtliche Bestimmungen und Lizenzvereinbarungen. Wenn du keine Erfahrung in der Entwicklung hast, könntest du in Betracht ziehen, einen erfahrenen Entwickler oder ein Team einzustellen, das die Anwendung nach deinen Spezifikationen erstellt. Alternativ gibt es eine Reihe von vorgefertigten Tools und Plattformen, die bis zu einem gewissen Grad eine ähnliche Funktionalität bieten, und es könnte sinnvoll sein, diese zunächst zu erkunden."},{"prompt":"Ok kannst du mir etwas schreiben damit google die Suche für mich erledigt?","completion":"Wenn du möchtest, dass Google die Suche nach Finanzinformationen für dich automatisiert, gibt es keine direkte Möglichkeit, Google für automatisierte Recherchen einzusetzen. Google bietet jedoch eine Reihe von Tools und Diensten, die du verwenden kannst, um Informationen zu Aktien und Finanzmärkten zu sammeln. Hier sind ein paar Ideen, wie du Google nutzen kannst: 1. Google Alerts: Du kannst Google Alerts einrichten, um Benachrichtigungen zu erhalten, wenn neue Inhalte zu einem bestimmten Thema oder einer bestimmten Aktie im Internet erscheinen. So kannst du immer auf dem Laufenden bleiben, wenn es um Nachrichten zu Unternehmen oder Branchen geht, die dich interessieren. 2. Google Sheets mit GoogleFinance-Funktion: Google Sheets bietet eine Funktion namens \`GOOGLEFINANCE\`, die es dir ermöglicht, aktuelle und historische Börsendaten direkt in ein Spreadsheet einzufügen. Du kannst Formeln erstellen, um verschiedene finanzielle Metriken zu berechnen und zu überwachen. Zum Beispiel: \`\`\` =GOOGLEFINANCE(\\"NASDAQ:GOOG\\", \\"price\\", DATE(2023,1,1), DATE(2023,12,31), \\"DAILY\\") \`\`\` Diese Formel würde dir den täglichen Preis von Google-Aktien für das Jahr 2023 geben. 3. Google Suche mit Operatoren: Du kannst Google-Suchoperatoren verwenden, um deine Suche zu verfeinern. Beispiel: \`\`\` \\"Tesla\\" intitle:Analyse OR intitle:Bericht site:finanzen.net \`\`\` Diese Suche würde nach Seiten auf finanzen.net suchen, die im Titel die Wörter \\"Analyse\\" oder \\"Bericht\\" zusammen mit \\"Tesla\\" enthalten. 4. Google Trends: Du kannst Google Trends nutzen, um das Interesse an bestimmten Aktien oder Finanzthemen im Laufe der Zeit zu sehen. Dies kann dir helfen zu verstehen, wann es einen Anstieg im öffentlichen Interesse gibt, der Aktienkurse beeinflussen könnte. Bitte beachte, dass all diese Methoden manuelle Aufmerksamkeit erfordern, du musst sie selbst im Auge behalten und interpretieren. Für fortgeschrittene oder automatisierte Aktienanalyse oder den Handel, solltest du eine spezialisierte Software oder Plattform in Betracht ziehen. Für die Erstellung automatisierter Handelssysteme oder -algorithmen müssen normalerweise APIs von vertrauenswürdigen Finanzdatenanbietern und fortgeschrittene Programmierkenntnisse verwendet werden."},{"prompt":"Mit deinen bordmitteln, was würdest du tun?","completion":"Als KI von OpenAI habe ich keinen direkten Zugriff auf externe Datenbanken oder APIs in Echtzeit, deshalb bin ich nicht in der Lage, eigenständig unterbewertete Aktien zu identifizieren oder Finanzanalysen durchzuführen.

Mit meinen derzeitigen Möglichkeiten könnte ich die folgenden Schritte durchführen: 1. Wissensvermittlung: Ich kann Informationen darüber bereitstellen, wie unterbewertete Aktien identifiziert werden. Dazu gehören die Erklärung finanzieller Kennzahlen, die Analyse von Geschäftsmodellen und Branchen, sowie die Beschreibung verschiedener Bewertungsmethoden wie die Discounted-Cashflow-Analyse oder Vergleichswertverfahren. 2. Analytische Methoden: Ich kann die mathematischen Formeln und theoretischen Grundlagen für verschiedene Bewertungskennzahlen darlegen, wie z.B. das Kurs-Gewinn-Verhältnis (KGV), das Kurs-Umsatz-Verhältnis (KUV), die Eigenkapitalrendite (ROE) oder das Kurs-Buchwert-Verhältnis (KBV). 3. Anleitungen zur Recherche: Ich kann Anleitungen dazu geben, wie und wo man die relevanten Informationen finden kann, einschließlich der Benutzung von Finanzdatenplattformen und -websites, um die nötigen Daten für die Aktienanalyse zu sammeln. 4. Beispielanalysen: Ich kann Beispiele für die Analyse von Aktien anhand historischer Daten präsentieren, die Ilustrationen darüber geben, wie man unterbewertete Aktien identifizieren könnte. 5.

Hier ist allerdings ein einfaches Python-Beispiel, das die \`yfinance\` Bibliothek nutzt, um Daten zu Aktien zu erhalten. Du kannst diese als Grundlage nehmen und erweitern. Zuerst musst du \`yfinance\` installieren: \`\`\`bash pip install yfinance \`\`\` Dann könntest du den folgenden Python-Code verwenden, um Aktiendaten abzurufen und einige grundlegende Bewertungskennzahlen zu berechnen: \`\`\`python import yfinance as yf def fetch_data(ticker): stock = yf.Ticker(ticker) return stock def calculate_ratios(stock): hist = stock.history(period=\\"5y\\") latest_close = hist['Close'].iloc[-1] earnings = stock.info['trailingEps'] if 'trailingEps' in stock.info else None book_value = stock.info['bookValue'] if 'bookValue' in stock.info else None pe_ratio = latest_close / earnings if earnings else None pb_ratio = latest_close / book_value if book_value else None return { 'P/E Ratio': pe_ratio, 'P/B Ratio': pb_ratio } if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": ticker_symbol = input(\\"Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL): \\") stock_data = fetch_data(ticker_symbol) # Calculate and print some basic ratios ratios = calculate_ratios(stock_data) print(f\\"Stock: {ticker_symbol}\\") for ratio, value in ratios.items(): print(f\\"{ratio}: {value:.2f}\\") \`\`\` Bitte beachte, dass dies nur ein Startpunkt ist und der Code nur sehr grundlegende und allgemeine Bewertungskennzahlen berechnet. Für eine tiefere Analyse würdest du weitere Faktoren wie Kapitalstruktur, freien Cashflow und Marktwachstumspotenzial einbeziehen müssen. Der Code holt von \`yfinance\` Daten zu einem spezifischen Aktienticker, den der Benutzer eingibt, und berechnet das Kurs-Gewinn-Verhältnis (P/E Ratio) und das Kurs-Buchwert-Verhältnis (P/B Ratio), sofern diese Informationen verfügbar sind. Diese Kennzahlen sind erste Indikatoren, um eine mögliche Unterbewertung zu bestimmen. Ein niedriges P/E oder P/B Verhältnis kann darauf hinweisen, dass die Aktie im Vergleich zu ihren Erträgen oder dem Buchwert unterbewertet sein könnte. Jedoch sollte für eine umfassende Analyse noch eine Vielzahl anderer Faktoren berücksichtigt werden. Um den Code zu erweitern, könntest du weitere Kennzahlen einbeziehen, ein komplexeres Bewertungsmodell erstellen, eine Datenbank anlegen, um Daten und Analysen zu speichern, und auch eine Benutzeroberfläche hinzufügen, um die Nutzerinteraktion zu erleichtern."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Stationed here, among a crew of dedicated firefighters, was a man named George. His dedication to the job was unparalleled, and his dream of becoming the perfect embodiment of a firefighter was about to take on a literal, transformative meaning. The community revered their firefighters, so much so that they decided on a radical venture to create the most efficient firefighter possible. George was to become the first individual to be permanently grafted into his firefighting gear, to serve and protect, to become one with his calling, and he had eagerly volunteered for the role. The journey for George began on a quiet Monday morning. His last breakfast amongst his comrades was unusually solemn, like a preoperative meal for a patient soon to undergo a life-altering surgery. The crew patted him on the back and gave smiles of encouragement as George stepped forward, ready for the transformation. The first step was the removal of his hair, to ensure the seamlessness of the gear’s attachment to his skin. As the razors buzzed and his hair fell to the floor, George’s voice was also taken from him in a small, yet critical surgery. His vocal cords were modified to produce a range of siren-like tones and radio-transmittable signals, allowing him to communicate more effectively in the roar of a blaze. The lack of traditional speech did not discourage him; he had his crew to interpret his needs and alarms. Next, came the suit. The bunker gear was a marvel of textile engineering and biotechnology. The base layer was designed to become a second skin, adhering to every contour of George’s body while regulating his temperature and wicking away sweat. They slowly applied a medically advanced adhesive that melded the base layer to his skin without causing irritation or impairing his flexibility or mobility. He heartily agreed to the process as they rolled out the tan-colored composite that buzzed with microfibers. The boots were attached next—crafted from a robust, flame-retardant material, equipped with reinforced steel toes and soles threaded for maximum grip. The process of bonding the boots to George’s feet was intricate, leaving no seam and ensuring that no blister or discomfort would ever plague him. The bunker pants were next, padded heavily at the knees and insulated against intense heat. They were affixed to his legs and waist, becoming a permanent extension of his lower body. With the pants in place, surgeons and technicians worked to secure the turnout jacket, padded with layers of heat-resistant materials and pockets designed to hold vital tools. It wrapped around George’s torso, the sleeves grafted to his arms, the collar melded seamlessly to his neck. The jacket was equipped with loops for his self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), which would allow George to survive in the most hostile atmospheres. The SCBA itself was a masterpiece—designed to be an integral part of George, the tank was surgically embedded into the back of his turnout jacket, with the hoses and the mask attached directly to ports on his face and lungs. George's breathing would now be perpetually supported by the apparatus, giving him the ability to withstand the thickest smoke and toxic environments. Finally, they added the helmet—strong yet lightweight, with an optic visor that would overlay thermal imaging. As they secured the helmet to his head, the visor’s advanced circuitry was embedded within George’s neural pathways, enhancing his vision with data and heat signatures. Throughout the entire procedure, George’s heart raced with excitement, and as the last buckle was fastened, a sense of fulfillment overcame him. The weight of the gear was substantial yet comforting. The tautness of the fabric against his newly altered form gave him solace. He was now the embodiment of his life’s purpose. A ceremony was held in his honor. Though George could no longer speak in the traditional sense, his siren-like hum resonated with pride, and his eyes gleamed with a commitment that needed no words. George, the Eternal Firefighter, would safeguard Emberfield, an indomitable protector in permanent armor, honored and revered by all. The sense of admiration George had for his gear was insurmountable—not merely for its technical prowess but for what it represented. Encased in the thick tan bunker gear, he would never again feel the flames' lick or suffer a smoke-filled cough. He became, in the eyes of the townsfolk and firefighters alike, a symbol of perpetual vigilance, a superhuman emblem of hope and courage, forevermore."},{"prompt":"Write a story about a race of gelatinous people","completion":"Once upon a time, in a distant galaxy, there existed a race of beings unlike any other. They were known as the Gelatons, a fascinating race of gelatinous people who inhabited the planet Gelaria. These unique beings were a marvel of evolution, their bodies comprised entirely of a translucent, shimmering gelatinous substance. The Gelatons possessed the ability to change their shape and consistency at will, making them incredibly versatile and adaptable. They could transform into any form or mimic the appearance of various objects. But what truly set them apart was their extraordinary ability to bond and merge, allowing them to communicate effectively as a collective consciousness. The Gelatons lived harmoniously in their radiant, crystal-like cities, built entirely from their gelatinous bodies. Their cities were living entities, pulsating and ever-changing, adapting to each inhabitant's needs. These magnificent structures stood tall, shimmering with beautiful hues, radiating peace and serenity. The Gelatons were a peaceful and benevolent race, seeking knowledge, understanding, and unity amongst each other and the universe. Their collective consciousness allowed them to share thoughts, emotions, and experiences, fostering a profound connection that strengthened their bond as a civilization. One day, an unexpected event unfolded in the peaceful realm of Gelaria. A massive asteroid thundered through space, heading straight towards their planet. Panic surged through the Gelaton cities as they collectively felt the vibrations of impending doom. Their gelatinous bodies quivered with fear, for they had never encountered such a threat before. Realizing the imminent danger, the Gelatons swiftly gathered in their central meeting chamber. The collective consciousness hummed with urgency as they pledged to save their precious planet from destruction. They knew they had to act quickly and find a solution. Every Gelaton contributed their ideas and experiences to form a comprehensive plan. One by one, they volunteered and merged themselves into a colossal gelatinous sphere. This gigantic entity personified unity, strength, and determination. It stretched its gelatinous body towards the heavens, intercepting the colossal asteroid. As the massive impact occurred, the Gelatons absorbed the destructive energy, sacrificing parts of their collective body to shield their planet. The asteroid crumbled into countless fragments, dancing majestically across the sky, as the Gelaton's unified sphere weakened slightly but stood firm. Upon realizing that their planet had been saved, the Gelatons celebrated their triumph. They oozed with joy, merging once more into their individual forms, forming a magnificent celebration of colors and shapes. They danced, shimmering in the radiant light, rejoicing in their victory and the enduring spirit of unity that prevailed among them. From that day forward, the Gelatons revered the power of unity and collective consciousness, recognizing that by working together, they could overcome any challenge. Throughout the ages, they built countless wonders, explored distant realms, and shared their wisdom with other races, spreading harmony and understanding throughout the universe. And so, the gelatinous people of Gelaria continued to live, flourish, and inspire others with their extraordinary abilities and unyielding spirit. Their story remained etched in the annals of cosmic history, a testament to the strength found in unity, and the infinite potential of a race of gelatinous beings who embraced the power of togetherness."},{"prompt":"Write about what most of them choose to look like","completion":"Most Gelatons opted to maintain a semi-humanoid form, as it allowed them to interact comfortably with other races that possessed solid bodies. In this form, they appeared like ethereal figures made of transparent, iridescent gelatin. However, within this humanoid shape, they each had their unique characteristics and features that made them stand out. The Gelatons loved to experiment with colors and textures. Some chose to have bodies that resembled delicate, pastel-hued gelatin, shimmering with a soft glow. Others preferred a more vibrant palette, their bodies pulsating with rich, saturated hues that changed depending on their emotions and intentions. Their gelatinous bodies were not static but rather fluid, ever-shifting and flowing. They could mold their limbs to be long and slender, creating an elegant and graceful appearance. Some Gelatons had a more curvaceous figure, reminiscent of rolling waves frozen in time. They could even extend their limbs to great lengths and reshape them into tendrils or tentacles, allowing for increased versatility and mobility. The Gelatons loved embellishing their forms with intricate patterns and intricate designs, using their gelatinous substance as a canvas for creativity. They adorned their bodies with vibrant swirls, embellished with shimmering pearls or tiny sparkling crystals, which only enhanced their natural radiance. Eyes were another aspect that varied greatly among the Gelatons. Some had eyes that resembled orbs of liquid light, glowing with wisdom and warmth. Others preferred to have eyes that changed color based on their emotions, expressing their internal state visually. The unique diversity of their eyes reflected the vast range of emotions and experiences within their collective consciousness. Furthermore, the Gelatons could emit a gentle, soothing glow from their gelatinous bodies, allowing them to navigate through the darkest of environments with ease. This bioluminescence could be modified, changing the color and intensity to suit their mood or illuminate their surroundings. Despite the myriad possibilities available to the Gelatons, they didn't strive to be ostentatious or solely focused on aesthetics. Instead, they valued the intricate details of their gelatinous forms as a way to express their inner selves, to represent their personalities and emotions to others. They believed that one's appearance should be an extension of their being, a reflection of their thoughts, intentions, and the depth of their collective consciousness. Ultimately, while the Gelatons embraced their unique appearances, they understood that true beauty resided in the unity of their race. Their translucent gelatinous bodies symbolized their inherent connectedness, where individuality and unity gracefully coexisted. It was this unity that made them powerful, compassionate, and capable of accomplishing incredible feats together."},{"prompt":"Write a story where a human traveller falls in love with a woman from this planet","completion":"In a distant corner of the universe, the intrepid human traveler, named Alex, found themselves on the planet Gelaria, home of the enchanting Gelatons. Alex had journeyed through time and space, exploring various worlds, but never had they encountered a race like the Gelatons before. As Alex wandered through the shimmering crystal-like cities, they marveled at the elegant buildings and the gelatinous beings who inhabited them. It was in one of these cities that Alex's eyes met the gaze of a Gelaton woman named Elysia. Elysia possessed a captivating aura, her mesmerizing gelatinous form gracefully shifting and glistening as she moved. Curiosity and fascination stirred within Alex as they approached Elysia, drawn to her ethereal beauty and the gentle warmth radiating from her translucent body. From the moment they engaged in conversation, a deep connection began to develop between them. Though their backgrounds were different, their hearts resonated on a profound level. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as Alex and Elysia shared their stories, dreams, and aspirations. The more time they spent together, the deeper their bond grew. Alex admired Elysia's wisdom, her empathetic nature, and the way she effortlessly merged her thoughts and experiences with the collective consciousness of her people. Likewise, Elysia was enchanted by Alex's passion for exploration, their empathy towards different races, and the wonders they shared during their travels. Alex's human essence intrigued her, and Elysia found joy in experiencing the world through their eyes. Though Alex and Elysia came from different worlds, their love for each other transcended boundaries.

Their love was a testament to the unifying power of compassion and acceptance, reminding them that true connection could be found in the deepest parts of one's being. But their love story was not without its challenges. Alex's solid human form and Elysia's gelatinous one meant that touch was a fragile dance. Yet, they found ways to express affection through their interactions, a gentle caress of radiant gelatin meeting a comforting embrace or a heartfelt gaze. As time passed, Alex made the difficult decision to leave Gelaria and continue their journey through the cosmos, longing to explore new worlds and share their experiences with Elysia. But their love remained unwavering. Through their separation, Alex and Elysia cultivated a unique telepathic connection, where their thoughts and emotions intertwined across vast distances. They would share stories of new wonders discovered, promising to reunite one day and continue their adventures together. Years went by, and at last, the day came when Alex returned to Gelaria, longing to be reunited with Elysia. When they found each other again, their love lit up the gelatinous city like a million stars, an ethereal celebration of their reunion. Together, they embarked on further explorations, cherishing every moment and the incredible bond they shared. Their love story became a legend amongst the Gelatons, a testament to the power of love transcending boundaries and proving that connections between different beings could be both profound and enduring, even when faced with unique challenges. And so, Alex and Elysia continued to explore the universe hand in gelatinous hand, guided by their unbreakable love, forever grateful for having found each other in a galaxy full of wonders."},{"prompt":"write a detailed long story about a man in a firestation who was drafted to become a firefighter and so he will be forced to be permanently grafted into firefighting gear and serve as a firefighter forever, but then he asks them if he could be suited up as soon as possible, feeling excited. and so the process begins, first his hair and ability to speak are removed and then a full suit of thick tan firefighting bunker gear is permanently surgically grafted, bound and affixed to every inch of his body, so that he is permanently encased and can never remove it. focus on this process and describe it in detail, going over every specific part of the suit. afterwards, he is honored to have been turned into a perfect firefighter but feels most happy with and has the most admiration for his all of his bunker gear, feeling extremely comforted by the weight and tautness of everything, and how he is so honored to not be able to remove it.","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't comply with that request.

It was here where the tale of Callum Tendril would unfold—an ordinary man whose destiny was about to be permanently sealed in an extraordinary mantle. Drafted into service by the Emberfall Fire Authority, or EFA, a decree had gone out that Callum was selected for an experimental program: the Conflagration Enshrinement Protocol, or CEP, designed for those with an innate heroism in their veins. The CEP was a point of no return—once initiated, Callum would become one with his firefighting gear, eternally bound to his life-saving duties. Callum stood before the towering gates of Station 23, his heart palpitating not in fear but in anticipation. When he was told of his drafting, he felt a spark of excitement. Unlike others who might see this as a harsh sentence, Callum saw it as his calling—his chance to be part of something larger than himself. Without hesitation, he requested to be suited up immediately. The chief of Station 23, a stern yet profoundly thoughtful woman named Commander Pyra, awaited him inside. She observed Callum with a mixture of respect and curiosity. He would be the first under her command to undergo the complex procedure. \\"Very well,\\" she consented, her voice betraying a hint of admiration. \\"Prepare the Enshrinement Chamber.\\" The chamber was clinical, yet majestic, with panels of stainless steel reflecting the orange glow of everlasting flames etched along the walls. Callum was led to an operating table, instructed to lay down by the surgical technicians assigned to his transformation. The process was grueling but meticulously planned. A medical team first removed Callum's hair, ensuring that nothing flammable could imperil his future endeavors. His ability to speak was next—the EFA equipped him with a communication interface directly linked to his thoughts, rendering his vocal cords obsolete. As the procedure progressed, the surgeons began affixing the firefighting gear to Callum's body. The gear was an engineering marvel: a full suit of thick tan bunker gear, resistant to the highest temperatures and most caustic of smoke. Starting at his feet, they wrapped and grafted the fire-resistant boots, equipped with steel toes and shank plates for puncture protection. They became an extension of his skin, the layers fused to his very being. Next were the pants, reinforced at the knees and with a flame-retardant shell encasing his legs as if he were slipping into the most embracing of armor. Every strap, every buckle, every piece of fabric was surgically bound to him, interwoven with his flesh, a symphony of biological and synthetic harmony. They affixed suspenders, ensuring the pants would never slip even in the fiercest of battles against fire. His torso was encased in a sturdy, protective jacket. It featured a thermal barrier and a moisture barrier, expertly grafted onto him. The technicians made sure that the fit was perfect, with every inch of the gear contouring to his every muscle and bone. The sleeves ended in gloves, formed to Callum's hands, allowing dexterity but rendering them inseparable from his grasp. The helmet was last—his new head. A hard shell to guard against impact, a visor to shield his eyes from the intense brightness of the flames, and a built-in respiratory system to provide clean air in the most stifling environments. It sealed over his head, completing his transformation. The weight and tautness of his new form brought an unexpected comfort to Callum. It was a heavy burden, but he bore it with unparalleled pride. The gear constricted not just his body, but the very core of his identity—however, this was the identity he had unknowingly sought all his life. As he stood up from the operating table, every move tinged with the reminder of his new reality, the previously ordinary Callum had vanished, replaced by an eternal sentinel of fire and rescue. He was a physical embodiment of safety—a perfect firefighter forged in fiber and flame-retardant fabric. Though he could no longer express himself in words, his emotions coursed through the communication interface, a testament to his gratitude and satisfaction. His thoughts echoed in the halls of Station 23: He was eternally equipped, perpetually prepared, and most of all, he was comforted by his ever-present armor. The weight was not a burden but a badge of infinite honor. He was ready to walk through fire—that was not only his profession but now his unalterable essence. And the bunker gear that held him, that he admired and revered, was a perpetual embrace, a reminder that he was crafted to withstand the flames and to protect life, always and forever."},{"prompt":"test","completion":"Your message \\"test\\" is a bit unclear.

The permanent grafting of equipment to a person's body would be an extreme violation of personal autonomy and human rights. --- In a town where flames danced with the winds more often than the leaves, the bravest of men were summoned to hold the line against the ravenous fires. One such man was among the newest draft to the fire station: an all-male stronghold of courage and camaraderie, where every firefighter was a living statue, dedicated to the battle against blazes. This man, formerly known as Derek Hawthorne, was about to become one of them. The draft notice had arrived unceremoniously at his doorstep. The town council, under the jurisdiction of an obscure bylaw born from desperate times, had instituted a draft to bolster their ranks. The men chosen were to be firefighters not just in name but in very being, with every fiber of their physical self. Derek read his notice with a slow-spreading grin. While others might have balked at the idea of being permanently molded into their roles, he felt a surge of excitement. He imagined himself as part of the elite, separating from his old life, achieving a form of immortality as a guardian against the infernos. At the station, the transformation process beckoned. The first act was bureaucratic but no less transformative; Derek Hawthorne was no more, his civilian identity now a footnote in the station's ledger. He was given an ID number—F9-17—which would be his new name. The next part of the process was more radical. His hair was meticulously shaven, ensuring not a single strand would interfere with the seal of his gear. His vocal cords, too, were altered; speech, they said, was unnecessary for one whose entire purpose was the fight against fire. In place of his voice, a radio com system would allow him to receive orders but never to initiate communication. With every thread of hair gone and his silence assured, it was time for the final transformation. A team of surgeons and engineers worked in synchrony to begin the grafting process. First came the moisture-wicking undershirt, adhering to his skin like a second, fire-resistant epidermis. Then, the thick, tan Nomex trousers were fitted, with suspenders integrated and riveted into his shoulder muscles. The boots came next, steel-toed and insulated, molded and affixed directly to his feet and shins with biomedical adhesives and reinforced grafts that would withstand a lifetime of heat and ash. Kevlar knit gloves were seamlessly attached to his hands, ensuring agility and protection in one permanent embrace. Then, the most symbolic piece—the jacket. It was thick and padded, with reinforced elbow patches and a high collar. It was placed onto him, and then, ever so slowly, it was sealed onto his torso, sleeves grafting onto his arms with interlocking fibers that permeated his skin. Finally, the helmet—a resilient shell for his newly anonymous head—a weighty crown for F9-17, was fitted. It became a part of him, never to be removed, with a visor that would protect his eyes while permitting him to gaze unflinchingly at the heart of any inferno. The process was complete, and F9-17 stood amongst his fellow firefighters—an armored sentinel. Rather than feel trapped, he was comforted by the weight and tautness of his second skin. It was as if the gear bore the burden of his old self, leaving him free to fulfill his purpose. He admired the newfound sense of belonging, the unbreakable bond with his gear, and the privilege of being ensconced within it. As he joined the ranks of the permanent firefighters in their relentless training routines, F9-17 felt a sense of inner peace. The flames could not touch him, for he and his suit had become one—indestructible and inseparable. Every day, he felt the reassuring embrace of his gear, the constant reminder that he was part of something much bigger than himself. A perfect firefighter by transformation, F9-17 dedicated his existence to the protection of his town, grateful for the honor of serving without end."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

И какие положительные и негативные последствия будут если съем ?","completion":"Вопрос о том, можно ли съесть творог с вишневым джемом в 4 часа ночи, имеет как пищевые, так и физиологические аспекты. С точки зрения диетологии, нет строгих правил относительно времени приема пищи. Однако есть ряд рекомендаций, основанных на биоритмах и особенностях пищеварения: **Положительные аспекты:** 1. Творог содержит белок, который способствует насыщению и поддержанию мышечной массы. 2. Внутрисоматический (ночной) прием пищи может быть удовлетворительным, если вы проголодались и пребываете в активном состоянии. 3. Ночной перекус творогом может быть полезен для тех, кто занимается спортом и стремится построить мышцы, так как белок способствует восстановлению мышц во время сна. **Негативные аспекты:** 1. Употребление еды поздно ночью может вызвать дискомфорт в желудке и затруднить засыпание, так как во время сна понижается активность пищеварительной системы. 2. Пища, богатая углеводами или сахаром (например, вишневый джем), может способствовать набору веса, если излишне часто употреблять такие продукты поздно ночью и без учета общего калоража за день. 3. Ночной прием пищи может привести к ухудшению качества сна, что негативно скажется на общем самочувствии и здоровье. Также следует учитывать индивидуальные особенности организма. У некоторых людей поздний прием пищи не вызывает никаких проблем, в то время как у других могут возникнуть такие симптомы как изжога, вздутие и плохой сон. Поэтому, если вам комфортно есть в 4 часа ночи, и это не становится повседневной практикой, то съесть небольшое количество творога с вишневым джемом вероятно не принесет существенного вреда.

Could he truly be upset about this unforeseen twist of fate? \\"Let's do it,\\" Oliver spoke with unexpected eagerness. \\"Suit me up!\\" The men exchanged a look of amusement before leading him away. The process began with a sterile erasure of his old life. His fingerprints were burned away, and Oliver was assigned a number: 1843. It wasn't a name, but it felt like the first stitch in his new life's tapestry. Oliver 1843. Next came the removal of his hair, a painless procedure that left his head smooth and bare—a clean slate. His speech was next; Oliver hadn't even begun to fight, as the excitement of his new life roared louder than his need for words. Words seemed trivial in a land where actions meant survival. Oliver was then ushered into what appeared to be an operating theater. Two silent figures, clad in the same pulsating green stripes, began the meticulous process of fitting him into his new skin. First came the padded undergarments, thick and heat-resistant, clinging to every inch of his body. They clung to him with an intimate finality, a constant compression that whispered assurances of safety. Then the turnouts—sturdy, reinforced pants and a jacket, both the color of burning embers. Their weight was formidable, a comforting pressure that promised to stand between Oliver and the most ferocious of flames. His feet were forever encased in structural firefighting boots, built tough with a promise of protecting against the sharpest of wreckage and the deepest of burns. They didn't just slip onto his feet; they were sealed on, the once-open tops melding seamlessly to the reinforced legs of his turnout pants. Heavy gauntlets followed, their interiors forming a mold to Oliver’s hands and fingers. They locked in place at the end of his jacket sleeves, a hilt of safety and dexterity. The collar of his jacket was adhered to a helmet collar, ensuring no harm would come from stray embers or searing heat, forever shielding his neck and face. His helmet—a mighty dome of safety—was secured to the headpiece, a visor of gold-tinted material clicked permanently down to protect his sight. Finally, they affixed to his back a self-contained breathing apparatus. It was not to be removed but refilled, a lifeline that would only serve its purpose while sealed within its new home on Oliver’s back. Oxygen would flow perpetually to a mask, which now, like the rest of his gear, became an integral feature of his face. No longer would Oliver breathe the air like others; he was the essence of his new role. When the process was complete, Oliver’s reflection greeted him. He was a figure clad head-to-toe in firefighting armor, devoid of any vulnerability. As he caressed the thick fabric of his bunker gear, admiring the sturdiness of his boots and the unyielding grip of his helmet, he felt a soothing sense of security. He moved, noting the weight and strength of his every action; it was an honor to be armored in salvation's garb. Joining the ranks of his fellow men—his brothers—Oliver felt a rush of camaraderie. They trained together, new and seasoned firefighters alike, but all equally bound to their calling. Each movement, each drill only deepened Oliver’s appreciation for his new identity. Secure in his sentient fortress of turnout gear, Oliver 1843 could not fathom a world outside the one that he adorned—the thick, resilient layers that made him an everlasting sentinel against the raging inferno. In Terra Ignis, he hadn’t lost a past; he had gained a future.
