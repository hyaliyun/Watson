Such points are known as rational points. We need to color all rational points using (n ) different colors in a specific way.

However, we can express P in terms of B and X: P = (49 + X) / 3 Now we substitute this expression for P into the equation 4P - X = 67: 4((49 + X) / 3) - X = 67 Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 4(49 + X) - 3X = 201 Expanding the left side, we have: 196 + 4X - 3X = 201 Combining like terms, we get: 196 + X = 201 Subtracting 196 from both sides, we find: X = 201 - 196 X = 5 So, boxed{5} minutes were subtracted from the time spent planning to get the time spent building."},{"prompt":"Determine which of the following is a factor of the polynomial (x^4 4x^2 + 16): (x^2 + 4) (x^2 1) (x^2 + 1) (x^2 + 3x + 2) None of these A) (x^2 + 4) B) (x^2 1) C) (x^2 + 1) D) (x^2 + 3x + 2) E) None of these","completion":"To determine which option is a factor, polynomial division is performed for each choice. 1. **Testing (x^2 + 4):** [ begin{align*} x^4 - 4x^2 + 16 & div (x^2 + 4) x^4 + 4x^2 & quad text{(First term of quotient is } x^2 text{)} underline{- (x^4 + 4x^2)} & -8x^2 + 16 & -8x^2 - 32 & quad text{(Add } -8 text{ times the divisor)} underline{- (-8x^2 - 32)} & 48 & quad text{(Remainder, not zero)} end{align*} ] The remainder is not zero, (x^2 + 4) is not a factor. 2. **Testing (x^2 - 1) (Difference of squares):** [ begin{align*} x^4 - 4x^2 + 16 & div (x^2 - 1) x^4 - x^2 & quad text{(First term of quotient is } x^2 text{)} underline{- (x^4 - x^2)} & -3x^2 + 16 & -3x^2 + 3 & quad text{(Add } -3 text{ times the divisor)} underline{- (-3x^2 + 3)} & 13 & quad text{(Remainder, not zero)} end{align*} ] The remainder is not zero, (x^2 - 1) is not a factor. 3. **Testing (x^2 + 1)** (Checking for simple sum of squares): [ begin{align*} x^4 - 4x^2 + 16 & div (x^2 + 1) x^4 + x^2 & underline{- (x^4 + x^2)} & -5x^2 + 16 & -5x^2 - 5 & underline{- (-5x^2 - 5)} & 21 & quad text{(Remainder, not zero)} end{align*} ] The remainder is not zero, (x^2 + 1) is not a factor.

The sum of the roots is given by -1 + 2 = 1 = frac{b}{a}, and the product of the roots is -1 times 2 = -2 = frac{c}{a}. From these, we deduce that b = a and c = -2a. Since the parabola opens downwards (as it crosses the x-axis at -1 and 2, and the solution to the inequality is between these points), we know a < 0. Therefore, b = a < 0 and c = -2a > 0 because -2a is positive when a is negative. Thus, option A is correct. **Option B: a-b+c > 0** Let y = ax^{2}-bx+c. According to the question, for x = 1, we have y = a - b + c > 0.

If theta = angle NAP, angle NMP = theta and angle ANP = 60^circ - theta. By the Law of Sines in triangle ANP, sin(theta) = frac{l}{4}, and sin(60^circ - theta) = frac{NP}{4}. 5. **Solving for theta:** sin(theta) = sin(60^circ - theta) implies theta = 30^circ (using angle property and simplifying).

Also, the result after subtraction is 11 less than the original number, which is 2000. So, the number after subtraction is 2000 - 11 = 1989. Since 1989 is exactly divisible by D, it means that 1989 is a multiple of D. Now, we need to find the least number that must be subtracted from 2000 to get 1989. That number is: 2000 - 1989 = 11 So, the least number to be subtracted from 2000 to get a number divisible by D is 11. Since 1989 is divisible by D and we subtracted 11 to get 1989, it means that 2000 is 11 more than a multiple of D. Therefore, D must be a divisor of 11. The divisors of 11 are 1 and 11. Since we are looking for the least number to be subtracted (which we found to be 11), the divisor cannot be 1 because subtracting 1 from 2000 would not give us 1989.

The correct factorization would be (y+x)(y-x) or simply (y+x)(y-x) since subtraction is commutative. The original is incorrect. Hence, there is only 1 correct factorization.

The function expressions are y_{A}=frac{2}{5}m for project A and y_{B}=-frac{1}{5}m^{2}+2m for project B. - Setting y_{A}=y_{B} gives the equation: frac{2}{5}m = -frac{1}{5}m^{2}+2m Simplifying this equation to find m: 0 = -frac{1}{5}m^{2} + 2m - frac{2}{5}m 0 = -frac{1}{5}m^{2} + frac{8}{5}m 0 = m(-frac{1}{5}m + frac{8}{5}) Solving for m, we get m_{1}=8 and m_{2}=0.

Since the bases of the trapezoid are parallel and the lengths are (a) and (frac{1}{2}a), you obtain a trapezoid (ABNM). 3. **Locate points (M) and (N):** Point (N) is the midpoint of (SC), so (SN = frac{1}{2} a).

To find the 251st multiple of 10, we multiply 251 by 10: 251st multiple of 10 = 251 * 10 = 2510 So, the median of all multiples of 10 from 10 to 5000 inclusive is 2510. Now, let's find the mode of the digits in these multiples. The mode is the digit that appears most frequently. Since we are dealing with multiples of 10, every number will end with a 0.

Let m(G) be the number of good maps. Prove that if every vertex in G is adjacent to at least one another vertex, then nleq m(G)leq n! .","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a simple graph ( G = G(V, E) ) with vertex set ( V ) and edge set ( E ). The number of vertices is ( |V| = n ). A map ( f: V rightarrow mathbb{Z} ) is called good if it satisfies: - (sum_{v in V} f(v) = |E|) - For any arbitrary coloring of some vertices into red, there exists a red vertex ( v ) such that ( f(v) ) is no more than the number of uncolored vertices adjacent to ( v ). We need to prove that if every vertex in ( G ) is adjacent to at least one other vertex, then ( n leq m(G) leq n! ), where ( m(G) ) is the number of good maps. 2. **Condition (2) Analysis:** Suppose we have a good mapping ( f ) of graph ( G ). Color all vertices red. By condition (2), there must be a vertex ( v_0 ) such that ( f(v_0) leq 0 ). Now uncolor ( v_0 ). Again, by condition (2), there must be some vertex ( v_1 ) such that ( f(v_1) ) is no more than the number of uncolored adjacent vertices to ( v_1 ), which is at most 1. Hence, ( f(v_1) leq 1 ). Continuing in this manner, we get a sequence of vertices ( v_0, v_1, ldots, v_n ) such that ( f(v_i) leq min{i, d(v_i)} ), where ( d(v_i) ) denotes the degree of vertex ( v_i ). 3. **Inductive Proof for ( n leq m(G) ):** - **Base Case:** For ( |V| = 2 ), there is nothing to prove. - **Inductive Step:** Assume it is true for ( |V| = k ) and consider ( |V| = k+1 ). Take any vertex ( v ) and remove it and its ( d(v) ) edges. By our assumption, there are at least ( n-1 ) good mappings of the new graph. For any of these good mappings, when we reattach ( v ), consider it as ( v_{k+1} ) in the vertex sequence, and it must satisfy property (2) by the previous analysis. Furthermore, we have ( |E| - |E'| = d(v_{k+1}) ), so let ( f(v_{k+1}) = d(v_{k+1}) ) and we also satisfy condition (1). This gives ( n-1 ) mappings of ( G ). We selected ( v ) arbitrarily, so we can do the same for all vertices. Moreover, when we select a vertex ( v ), we generate ( n-1 ) mappings where ( f(v) = d(v) ). So suppose we take a vertex ( v ) for one of the mappings ( f_1 ), there must be a vertex ( u ) such that ( f_1(u) < d(u) ) (from (1)). Then take vertex ( u ) and generate another ( n-1 ) mappings ( f_2, f_3, ldots, f_n ). These must be distinct from ( f_1 ) because ( f_k(u) = d(u) ) for ( k > 1 ). So the inductive step is complete. 4. **Upper Bound ( m(G) leq n! ):** - **Nice Maps:** Call a map *nice* if it satisfies condition (2), and instead of condition (1), we have (sum_{v in V} f(v) = N geq |E|). Suppose we have a nice map ( f ) for which (sum_{v in V} f(v) = N > |E|). If we take any vertex ( v ) and reduce ( f(v) ) by 1, then we preserve property (2) and ( N ) falls to ( N-1 geq |E| ). On the other hand, if we have a vertex ( v ) and increase ( f(v) ) by 1, we do not necessarily preserve condition (2). It follows that the number of nice maps for a fixed ( N ) cannot increase as ( N ) increases. - **Inductive Proof:** It's trivial for ( |V| = 2 ). Assume true for ( |V| = k ) and consider ( G ) with ( |V| = k+1 ). Take some good mapping of ( G ). From the previous analysis, we can select some vertex ( v_{k+1} ) and remove it and preserve condition (2). Furthermore, ( f(v_{k+1}) ) is uniquely determined by the other values of the function by condition (1). Then we must have (sum_{i=0}^k f(v_k) = N geq |E| - d(v_{k+1}) geq |E| - n). So we have that the map on ( G setminus v_{k+1} ) is nice. When ( N = |E| - d(v_{k+1}) ), the map is good (in the original sense), so by our assumption, there are no more than ( (n-1)! ) such maps. As ( N ) increases to ( |E| - 1 ), at each fixed ( N ), we can have no more than ( (n-1)! ) maps. Consequently, ( G setminus v_{k+1} ) can have no more than ( n cdot (n-1)! = n! ) nice maps, implying ( G ) has no more than ( n! ) good maps.

If ( | x_i | = 0.5 ), let ( m_i = x_i - 0.5 ). Let ( { x_i } = text{sgn}(x_i - m_i) times | x_i | ). 2. **Step 1: Smoothing the values:** For any two ( x_a ) and ( x_b ) such that ( -0.5 < { x_a } < 0 < { x_b } < 0.5 ), note that ( (x_a, x_b) rightarrow (x_a - varepsilon, x_b + varepsilon) ) increases the sum of ( f(x_a) + f(x_b) ). We repeat this until one of ( { x_a }, { x_b } ) is equal to 0.5. Henceforth, we may assume ( { x_i } ) are all positive or all negative with none or some equal to 0.5. 3. **Step 2: Rearranging the integer parts:** Suppose ( | x_a | le | x_b | ). If ( m_a > m_b ), then note: [ f(x_a - m_a + m_b) + f(x_b + m_a - m_b) = (x_a - m_a + m_b)^2 | x_a |^2 + (x_b + m_a - m_b)^2 | x_b |^2 ge (x_a | x_a |)^2 + (x_b | x_b |)^2 = f(x_a) + f(x_b) ] where the inequality holds by Rearrangement. So, we shift ( x_a ) and ( x_b ) accordingly. Repeating this across all possible pairs ( (x_a, x_b) ) arranges the ( x_i ) in the same order of ( | x_i | ). 4. **Step 3: Adjusting the fractional parts:** Consider any ( x_a, x_b ) such that ( 0.5 > | x_a | ge | x_b | ). We shift ( x_a ) and ( x_b ) such that ( | x_a | ) increases while ( | x_b | ) decreases, keeping ( m_a ) and ( m_b ) constant (unless one of ( | x_a |, | x_b | ) becomes 0.5). If ( m_a = m_b ), then ( x_a, x_b ) are on the function ( f(x) = x^2 (m_a - x)^2 ), which is convex, so ( f(x_a) + f(x_b) ) also increases. Otherwise, ( m_a > m_b ), and consequently ( x_a > x_b ). Then note ( f(x_a) = x_a^2 (m_a - x_a)^2 ) and ( f(x_b) = x_b^2 (m_b - x_b)^2 ), and a quick computation finds that ( |f'(x_a)| > |f'(x_b)| ), so this also increases the sum ( f(x_a) + f(x_b) ). This process ends when ( | x_a | ) reaches 0.5 or when ( | x_b | ) reaches 0. Now we repeat this process, performing step 2 also after each iteration of this process (which reorders the integer parts). At the end, we are left with ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_n in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, dots, n-0.5, n} ). 5. **Step 4: Maximizing the sum:** Select the largest among ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_n ), and WLOG it is ( x_n ). For any ( x_i in mathbb{Z}^+ ), replace ( (x_i, x_n) rightarrow (0, x_i + x_n) ). This clearly increases the sum ( f(x_i) + f(x_n) ). The rest of the points belong to the set ( {0, 0.5, 1.5, dots, n-0.5} ), and the corresponding ( f(x_i) ) values lie on the curve ( f(x) = frac{x^2}{4} ). This curve is convex, so the sum ( f(x_1) + cdots + f(x_n) ) achieves a maximum when the ( x_i ) are at the (discrete) endpoints, which is when ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_{n-2} = 0 ), ( x_{n-1} = 0.5 ), and ( x_n = n - 0.5 ). 6. **Final Calculation:** [ sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 = (0.5 cdot 0.5)^2 + ((n - 0.5) cdot 0.5)^2 = frac{0.5^2}{4} + frac{(n - 0.5)^2}{4} = frac{0.25}{4} + frac{(n - 0.5)^2}{4} = frac{0.25 + (n - 0.5)^2}{4} ] [ = frac{0.25 + n^2 - n + 0.25}{4} = frac{n^2 - n + 0.5}{4} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{n^2 - n + 0.5}{4}})"},{"prompt":"Through a certain point Q, taken inside the triangle ABC, three lines parallel to its sides are drawn.

Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and there are 5 cows, so: 5 cows * 2 acres/cow/month = 10 acres/month for cows Each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month, and there are 8 sheep, so: 8 sheep * 1 acre/sheep/month = 8 acres/month for sheep Total grass consumption per month is: 10 acres/month for cows + 8 acres/month for sheep = 18 acres/month for all animals The rancher has 144 acres of grass available, so let's calculate how many months the grass will last. 144 acres / 18 acres/month = 8 months The grass will last for 8 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, the rancher will need to buy feed corn for the remaining 4 months (12 months - 8 months = 4 months). Now, let's calculate how many bags of feed corn are needed for each type of animal for the remaining 4 months. Each cow needs 1 bag of feed corn per month, so for 5 cows over 4 months: 5 cows * 1 bag/cow/month * 4 months = 20 bags for cows Each sheep needs 1 bag of feed corn for 2 months, so for 8 sheep over 4 months, we first calculate how many bags are needed for 2 months and then double it for 4 months: 8 sheep * (1 bag/2 months) * 4 months = 16 bags for sheep Total bags of feed corn needed for 4 months: 20 bags for cows + 16 bags for sheep = 36 bags The rancher spends 360 on feed corn for the year, so to find the price per bag, we divide the total cost by the number of bags needed. 360 / 36 bags = 10 per bag The price of one bag of feed corn is boxed{10} ."},{"prompt":"is currently 3:00:00 PM, as shown on a 12hour digital clock.

To prove this, we will use mathematical induction. 1. **Base Cases:** - For n = 1: - The only subsets are {} and {1}. - The sum of the squares of the products of the numbers in these subsets is 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 = 2! - 1. - Hence, the proposition holds for n = 1. - For n = 2: - The subsets are {}, {1}, and {2}. - The sum of the squares of the products of the numbers in these subsets is 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 = 3! - 1. - Hence, the proposition holds for n = 2. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Suppose the proposition holds for some integer k, i.e., for the set {1, 2, cdots, k}, the sum of the squares of the products of the numbers in the subsets that do not contain consecutive numbers is: [ S_k = (k+1)! - 1. ] 3. **Inductive Step:** We need to show that if the proposition holds for n = k, it also holds for n = k+1.

Therefore, each of these subsets can be formed by adding k+1 to a subset of {1, 2, cdots, k-1}. - The sum of the squares of the products of the numbers in these subsets is: [ S_1 = (k+1)^2 left[ S_{k-1} + 1 right] = (k+1)^2 left[ k! - 1 right] + (k+1)^2, ] where S_{k-1} = k! - 1 by the induction hypothesis for n = k-1. - **Type 2 Subsets:** These are simply the subsets of {1, 2, cdots, k} that do not include k+1. Their sum of the squares of the products of the numbers is: [ S_2 = S_k = (k+1)! - 1, ] by the induction hypothesis for n = k. - Now, we combine the sums from both types: [ S_{k+1} = S_1 + S_2. ] - Substitute the values of S_1 and S_2: [ S_{k+1} = (k+1)^2 left[ k! - 1 right] + (k+1)^2 + (k+1)! - 1. ] - Simplify the equation: [ S_{k+1} = (k+1)^2 cdot k! - (k+1)^2 + (k+1)^2 + (k+1)! - 1. ] - Notice that the middle terms -(k+1)^2 and +(k+1)^2 cancel out: [ S_{k+1} = (k+1)^2 cdot k! + (k+1)! - 1. ] - Factor out (k+1)!: [ S_{k+1} = (k+1)! left( 1 + k+1 right) - 1 = (k+2)! - 1. ] 4. **Conclusion:** Hence, by mathematical induction, the proposition holds for all natural numbers n.

This implies that both AC and BC must be tangent to the circle, and their lengths can be denoted as 1. 2. **Using Inversion Geometry:** Perform an inversion with respect to a unit circle centered at C. Under this inversion: - The angle's sides and the circle remain invariant. - Points A and B transform to points A' and B'.

Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of PQ passes through D. - Since P and Q are on the vertical line ell, the line segment PQ is horizontal. - The line AP is perpendicular to PQ because A lies on the circle and P is a point on the circle. - Similarly, the line BQ is perpendicular to PQ because B lies on the circle and Q is a point on the circle. 6. **Conclude the proof:** - Since AP and BQ are both perpendicular to PQ, it follows that AP perp BQ. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the ellipse E: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 (a > b > 0) with one vertex being the focus of the parabola y^{2}=8x and an eccentricity of frac{1}{2}: 1.

We need to determine if it is possible to obtain the numbers (90), (10), and (14) after repeatedly performing the operations described above. 1. **Initial Calculation:** - Take numbers (89) and (12). - Calculate the sum and divide by (sqrt{2}): [ frac{89 + 12}{sqrt{2}} = frac{101}{sqrt{2}} ] - Calculate the difference and divide by (sqrt{2}): [ frac{89 - 12}{sqrt{2}} = frac{77}{sqrt{2}} ] After these operations, the new set of numbers will be (left(frac{101}{sqrt{2}}, frac{77}{sqrt{2}}, 3right)). 2. **Next Steps:** We will continue with similar operations on the new set of numbers. It is evident that the calculations are becoming more complex. Furthermore, the process of choosing which pair of numbers to operate on each time is non-trivial, and thus selecting the proper numbers consistently is not straightforward. 3. **Observing Invariant:** Let's identify a potential invariant in this sequence of operations, such as examining the sum of the squares of the numbers. For an initial set of numbers ((a, b, c)), the transformed set after one operation will be (left(frac{a+b}{sqrt{2}}, frac{a-b}{sqrt{2}}, cright)).

Applying this to the terms we get: binom{n}{5} = binom{n}{n-5}, and binom{n}{6} = binom{n}{n-6}.

Since x must be divisible by both 12 and 15, it must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime numbers that appear in the prime factorizations of these numbers. Thus, the LCM of 12 and 15 is 2^2 cdot 3 cdot 5. The number of positive factors of a number can be determined by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying these numbers together. For a number of the form a^p cdot b^q cdot c^r, the number of positive factors is (p+1)(q+1)(r+1). Applying this to the LCM, which is 2^2 cdot 3^1 cdot 5^1, we find the number of factors by calculating (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 cdot 2 cdot 2 = 12.

According to the problem, the hole left in the ice is a segment of the ball with a height of 2 cm and the flat circular bottom part of the hole is a circle with a diameter of 12 cm, which means its radius is 6 cm. 1.

From the problem, we know that h=2 cm and the radius of the circle that forms the flat part of the segment is 6 cm.

By Pythagoras' theorem for the radius of the spherical cap, we have: (r - h)^2 + 6^2 = r^2.

This is because squaring a real number gives its magnitude squared, and comparing the squares indicates a comparison of the magnitudes. 2. Similarly, from the condition a^{3} gt b^{3}, it follows directly that a gt b. This is because cubing a real number maintains the sign of the original number, so comparing their cubes is directly comparing the numbers. To explore the sufficiency and necessity of these conditions, we consider examples: - Let's consider a=-2 and b=1. This choice gives us a^{2} = 4 gt b^{2} = 1, which satisfies |a| gt |b|. However, it does not satisfy a gt b because -2 lt 1. This example shows that having a^{2} gt b^{2} is not sufficient to guarantee a^{3} gt b^{3}. - For the case a=-2 and b=-3, we observe that a^{2} = 4 gt b^{2} = 9, which seems incorrect according to our initial analysis; instead, a^{2} = 4 lt b^{2} = 9 is the correct relation, showing an error in the illustration.

Additionally, since K is constructed such that line DK is parallel to diagonal AC, by construction we know: [ DK parallel AC. ] 6. Next, note that if MN is a line segment joining midpoints of the bases of the trapezoid and FG joins the centroids of ABD and BCD, then MN is parallel to the bases and FG is parallel to the diagonal AC as well. 7. Hence, FG also needs to be parallel to DK. Now consider Z, which must be the centroid of the trapezoid relative to these axes: [ MZ parallel FG quad text{and} quad MZ = frac{1}{3} MK. ] 8. Given that MN is a median line and MO is constructed such that MO = frac{1}{3} MK, it follows directly from the properties of centroids and lines parallel to bases of a trapezoid that MZ would intersect MK at the same point. 9. Consequently, [ MZ = frac{1}{3} MK, ] thus confirming that Z coincides with O, proving O is the centroid of trapezoid ABCD. Conclusion: [ boxed{MO = frac{1}{3} MK} ] Hence the point O is indeed the centroid of the trapezoid ABCD. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"As shown in the diagram, fill in the table according to the following requirements: 1.

Let's analyze each condition methodically: 1. Fill each cell with a number less than 10. 2. Numbers in the same region must be the same. 3. The left-most column cannot contain the number 0. 4. The four-digit number formed by the first-row cells from left to right can be expressed as ( p^q ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are prime numbers. 5.

The four-digit number formed by the third-row cells from left to right is a perfect square. 7. The four-digit number formed by the fourth-row cells from left to right is a multiple of 37. Let’s solve each condition one by one: Condition 6: Identifying the Perfect Square The number formed by the third-row cells, overline{EEGG}, is a perfect square. Here are the steps: - Possible endings for perfect squares less than 10,000 are 00, 25, 76, or 49. - Since overline{EEGG} ends in a repeat (e.g., GG are the same), possible candidates are 7744 (since 88^2 = 7744) or 6561 (since 81^2 = 6561). - Check further: Since 7744 = 88^2, overline{EEGG} = 7744. This means E = 7, G = 4. Condition 7: Identifying the Multiple of 37 The number overline{7H44} (derived from row 4) must be a multiple of 37: - We know 7744 = 88 times 88 but 7744 has already been used in row 3. - Next, overline{7H44} looks familiar to overline{7H44}. It includes 744 (since overline{7744} matched row 3). Thus, we calculate for H so overline{7H44}. - Evaluate compatibility with the multiple of 37: - Check 7H44: Trial and error show overline{7H44} = 7844 works since 7844 = 212 times 37. Thus, H = 8. Condition 5: Identifying product of two consecutive primes The number overline{EFCD} (row 2) should be the product of two consecutive primes: - Given C=8, D=7. Check by substituting into overline{7F87}. - Candidates like 79 * 83 = 6557 or 83 * 89 = 7387: - Clearly, 83 times 89 = 7387 is correct such that: F = 3, C = 8, D = 7 Condition 4: Identifying as ( p ) and ( q ) Row 1 must resolve into ( p^q ): - Prime number check confirms 3^7 = 2187 as valid. - Thus, ABCD = 2187 meaning A = 2, B = 1, C = 8, D = 7. # Conclusion After thoroughly checking, numbers according to conditions: [ boxed{ begin{matrix} 2 & 1 & 8 & 7 7 & 3 & 8 & 7 7 & 7 & 4 & 4 7 & 8 & 4 & 4 end{matrix} } ]"},{"prompt":"Given a right triangle with legs a and b, and hypotenuse c, where the ratio a:b = 2:5.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is boxed{frac{9}{4}}.

Adding the three inequalities together yields: 2a^2b^2 + 2a^2 + 2b^2 geq 2a^2b + 2ab^2 + 2ab Simplifying by dividing both sides by 2, we obtain: a^2b^2 + a^2 + b^2 geq a^2b + ab^2 + ab Noticing that a^2b + ab^2 + ab = ab(a+b+1), we can rewrite the inequality as: a^2b^2 + a^2 + b^2 geq ab(a+b+1) Thus, it is proven that the original inequality holds."},{"prompt":"The height of the tetrahedron PABC is PH, and the angles between the three lateral faces and the base are equal.

To do so, calculate the derivative (f'(x)) and find its critical points: [ f(x) = 2 + 2x^2 - x - x^3 ] [ f'(x) = 4x - 1 - 3x^2 ] 4. Setting (f'(x) = 0) to find the critical points: [ 4x - 1 - 3x^2 = 0 implies 3x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 ] Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) where (a = 3), (b = -4), and (c = 1): [ x = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 12}}{6} = frac{4 pm 2}{6} ] [ x = 1 text{ or } x = frac{1}{3} ] 5. Evaluate (f(x)) at the critical points and endpoints (0) and (1): [ fleft(frac{1}{3}right) = 2 + 2left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 - left(frac{1}{3}right) - left(frac{1}{3}right)^3 = 2 + 2left(frac{1}{9}right) - frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{27} ] [ = 2 + frac{2}{9} - frac{3}{9} - frac{1}{27} = 2 - frac{1}{9} - frac{1}{27} = 2 - frac{3}{27} - frac{1}{27} = 2 - frac{4}{27} = frac{54 - 4}{27} = frac{50}{27} ] At (x = 0): [ f(0) = 2 ] At (x = 1): [ f(1) = 2 + 2(1) - 1 - 1 = 2 + 2 - 1 - 1 = 2 ] 6. Therefore, the maximum value of (f(x)) in the interval (0 < x < 1) is 2.

Applying the above inequality to each (x_i): [ -frac{1}{2} x_1 + 1 < frac{1}{1 + x_1^2} ] [ -frac{1}{2} x_2 + 1 < frac{1}{1 + x_2^2} ] [ vdots ] [ -frac{1}{2} x_n + 1 < frac{1}{1 + x_n^2} ] 2. Summing up these inequalities: [ sum_{i = 1}^{n} left( -frac{1}{2} x_i + 1 right) < sum_{i = 1}^{n} frac{1}{1 + x_i^2} ] [ sum_{i = 1}^{n} (-frac{1}{2} x_i) + sum_{i = 1}^{n} 1 < sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{1 + x_i^2} ] [ -frac{1}{2} (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n) + n < frac{1}{1 + x_1^2} + frac{1}{1 + x_2^2} + cdots + frac{1}{1 + x_n^2} ] 3. Using the given (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n = 1): [ -frac{1}{2} cdot 1 + n < frac{1}{1 + x_1^2} + frac{1}{1 + x_2^2} + cdots + frac{1}{1 + x_n^2} ] [ n - frac{1}{2} < frac{1}{1 + x_1^2} + frac{1}{1 + x_2^2} + cdots + frac{1}{1 + x_n^2} ] 4.

Now, we divide by 5 to find the maximum marks for each subject: M = 1591.666... / 5 M = 318.333... Since the maximum marks for a subject are typically a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number. However, we need to be careful because rounding down might not give us enough total marks to reach the required 955 marks to pass. So, we should round up to ensure the student has the opportunity to reach the passing threshold. M = 319 (rounded up) Therefore, the maximum marks for each subject are boxed{319} ."},{"prompt":"w many positive fourdigit integers of the form __40 are divisible by 40?","completion":"Let the four-digit integer be ab40, where a and b are digits.

If (s) is the side length of the square, then: [ s^2 = 1 implies s = 1 ] So, we have a square with side length (s = 1). 3. **Placing the square in the isosceles triangle:** The side length of the square is equal to the height of the triangle segment between the base and the top edge of the square. 4. **Centroid location of both the triangle and the square:** For a square, the centroid is at its geometric center, which is clearly (left(frac{s}{2}, frac{s}{2}right)) or (left(frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}right)) in this case.

Thus, the base condition holds trivially. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume that for ( n-1 ) parabolas, the area above them has no more than ( 2(n-2) ) intersection points (vertices). 3. **Induction Step**: Consider ( n ) quadratic polynomials given by ( f_1(x), f_2(x), ldots, f_n(x) ). Without loss of generality, assume ( f_n(x) ) is the quadratic polynomial with the minimum leading coefficient (or choose any one if multiple have the same minimum leading coefficient). 4. **Graph Analysis**: Let ( T ) denote the boundary of the region above all ( n ) parabolas.

By the induction hypothesis, this new configuration has at most ( 2(n-2) ) vertices. 9. **Reassembling**: Adding back the ( f_n(x) ) can introduce at most 2 new vertices because ( f_n(x) ) intersects each of the other ( n-1 ) parabolas in at most 2 points. Thus, the total number of vertices in the configuration of ( n ) parabolas is: [ 2(n-2) + 2 = 2(n-1) ] # Conclusion: Hence, by mathematical induction, we have shown that the boundary of the region above ( n ) parabolas has at most ( 2(n-1) ) vertices.

For example, if we choose colors ( (a, b, c, d, e) ), we can color the vertices as ( (a, b, c, d, e, a, b, c, d, e, ldots) ).

The condition x geq 1 or x leq -1 from A is the relevant one, but since B does not restrict x directly, we consider the entire real line for x. The intersection, therefore, focuses on the condition from A that ensures y geq 0, which is satisfied for all x in A.

This implies that there could be at most 90 cyclists with a better (lower-numbered) total time than Vasya. - Therefore, Vasya can potentially finish right after these 90 cyclists, giving him the rank: [ 1 + 90 = 91 ] Hence, Vasya’s worst possible rank (highest number) is 91, meaning there cannot be more than 90 cyclists above him; otherwise, there would be not enough distinct cyclists overtaking Vasya consistently. 5. **Example of Achieving Position 91**: - To verify that 91st place is possible for Vasya, consider the following: - If in each stage, the 6 cyclists finishing ahead of Vasya are different, we then have 90 distinct cyclists who consistently finish ahead of him. - Assume these 90 cyclists have all different total times just ahead of Vasya. - The remaining 409 cyclists finish behind Vasya in every stage and thus have worse total times than him. - If Vasya's total time is consistently ( T_7 ) per stage, and assume ( T_7 ) is in the middle range as described.

Let's start by analyzing the given condition (angle ABD + angle DAC = 90^circ). 3. **Step 1**: Consider the diagonals (AC) and (BD) of the parallelogram (ABCD). These diagonals intersect at point (O). 4. **Step 2**: Since (ABCD) is a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, (O) is the midpoint of both (AC) and (BD). 5. **Step 3**: Given (angle ABD + angle DAC = 90^circ), we need to explore the implications of this condition. 6. **Step 4**: Let's denote (angle ABD = alpha) and (angle DAC = beta). According to the given condition, we have: [ alpha + beta = 90^circ ] 7. **Step 5**: In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. Therefore, we have: [ angle ABD = angle CDB quad text{and} quad angle DAC = angle BAC ] 8. **Step 6**: Since (alpha + beta = 90^circ), we can write: [ angle ABD + angle BAC = 90^circ ] 9. **Step 7**: Now, consider the triangles (triangle ABD) and (triangle DAC). Since (angle ABD + angle BAC = 90^circ), these angles form a right angle at point (A). 10. **Step 8**: For the parallelogram to satisfy this condition, the diagonals must intersect at right angles. This is a property of both rectangles and rhombuses. 11. **Step 9**: If the diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at right angles, the parallelogram is either a rectangle or a rhombus. This is because: - In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and intersect at right angles. - In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal but intersect at right angles. 12. **Conclusion**: Given the condition (angle ABD + angle DAC = 90^circ), the parallelogram (ABCD) must be either a rectangle or a rhombus.

The 2-digit prime numbers are: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. Let's start by checking the divisibility of 54,321 by each of these prime numbers and find the smallest positive difference (if any) that would make 54,321 divisible by the prime number. For example, if we check divisibility by 11: 54,321 ÷ 11 = 4938 with a remainder of 3. To make 54,321 divisible by 11, we would need to add 8 (11 - 3) to it.

Next, we check for 13: 54,321 ÷ 13 = 4178 R7 To make it divisible by 13, we need to add 6. We continue this process until we find the smallest number to be added. However, since we are looking for the least number to be added, we can stop as soon as we find a remainder of 1 because adding 1 would be the smallest possible number to add to make it divisible. Let's check for the next few primes: For 17: 54,321 ÷ 17 = 3195 R6 To make it divisible by 17, we need to add 11. For 19: 54,321 ÷ 19 = 2859 R2 To make it divisible by 19, we need to add 17. We can stop here because we have found a remainder of 1 when dividing by 19.

This implies that for any two distinct bold{v_i} and bold{v_j}, there exists an index m in {1, 2, dots, r} such that the m-th entry of bold{v_j} is smaller than the m-th entry of bold{v_i}. 5. **Infinite Pigeonhole Principle**: Comparing with bold{v_1}, by the infinite version of the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists an m in {1, 2, dots, r} and a sequence of positive integers {x_i}_{i=1}^{infty} such that the m-th entry of bold{v_{x_i}} is smaller than the m-th entry of bold{v_1}. 6. **Subsequence with equal entries**: Since each entry is a non-negative integer, using the infinite version of the Pigeonhole Principle again, we get a subsequence {y_i}_{i=1}^{infty} of {x_i}_{i=1}^{infty} such that the m-th entry of each bold{v_{y_i}} is equal. Let c be the common entry. 7. **New sequence construction**: Divide each a_{y_i} by p_m^c.

This contradicts the minimality of r. Therefore, our initial assumption that there exists a sequence {a_i}_{i=1}^{infty} with only finitely many primes dividing its terms must be false. Hence, the set of primes dividing at least one term of the sequence must be infinite. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A cyclist is walking at a constant rate of 15 miles per hour along a path with a flat surface when she is passed by a car traveling in the same direction at 60 miles per hour.

Find how many minutes the car must wait for the cyclist to catch up.","completion":"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the car to travel the additional mile after passing the cyclist. Since the car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 60 miles per hour, so: Time_car = 1 mile / 60 miles per hour = 1/60 hours To convert this time to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour: Time_car = (1/60) * 60 minutes = 1 minute So, the car takes 1 minute to travel the additional mile and then stops to wait for the cyclist. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the cyclist to travel the same mile uphill. Since the cyclist's speed decreases linearly from 15 mph to 10 mph over the course of the mile, we can find the average speed over this distance. The average of 15 mph and 10 mph is: Average_speed_cyclist = (15 mph + 10 mph) / 2 = 25 mph / 2 = 12.5 mph Now we can calculate the time it takes for the cyclist to travel the uphill mile at the average speed: Time_cyclist = Distance / Average_speed Time_cyclist = 1 mile / 12.5 miles per hour To convert miles per hour to miles per minute, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time_cyclist = 1 mile / (12.5 miles per hour / 60 minutes per hour) Time_cyclist = 1 mile / (12.5 / 60) miles per minute Time_cyclist = 1 mile / (1 / 4.8) miles per minute Time_cyclist = 1 mile * 4.8 minutes per mile Time_cyclist = 4.8 minutes Now we can find the difference in time between the car and the cyclist to determine how long the car has to wait: Wait_time = Time_cyclist - Time_car Wait_time = 4.8 minutes - 1 minute Wait_time = 3.8 minutes Therefore, the car must wait for approximately boxed{3.8} minutes for the cyclist to catch up."},{"prompt":"Let left(a_{n}right) be the sequence defined by a_{1}=1 and a_{n+1}=1+a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n}.

The product of these integers is ( n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4) ). 2. **Assume for Contradiction**: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the product of these five consecutive integers is a perfect square. So, we can write: [ P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4) = k^2 quad text{for some integer } k. ] 3. **Parity Analysis**: Since we are dealing with five consecutive integers, at least one of these integers must be divisible by 2 (even) and at least one must be divisible by 3. Furthermore, among any five consecutive integers, exactly one is divisible by 5. 4. **Modulo 5 Analysis**: Consider the product modulo 5. Since there is exactly one multiple of 5 among the five consecutive integers: [ P equiv 0 pmod{5}. ] This means ( k^2 equiv 0 pmod{5} ), implying that ( k ) must be divisible by 5. Therefore, ( k = 5m ) for some integer ( m ). 5. **Modulo 3 Analysis**: Similarly, considering modulo 3, we have three possibilities: [ P equiv 0, 1, 2 pmod{3}. ] But since the product must be a perfect square, ( k^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), implying that ( k ) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, ( k = 3n ) for some integer ( n ). 6. **Combining Modulo Conditions**: From both congruences, ( k ) must be divisible by both 3 and 5. Hence, ( k ) must be divisible by ( text{lcm}(3, 5) = 15 ). Therefore, let ( k = 15m ). 7. **Contradiction**: Now, the product ( P = (15m)^2 = 225m^2 ). Given that ( P ) is composed of five consecutive integers, let's explore their properties modulo 24 instead: - At least one of these integers is divisible by 2. - At least one of these integers is divisible by 3. - Exactly one of these integers is divisible by 5. Thus, when extended to a higher modulus, it becomes increasingly difficult to balance the properties required for ( P ) to be a perfect square. Let's refine that argument. If ( P ) were to be a perfect square, the congruences bring contradictions since: [ k = 15m quad Rightarrow quad P = (15m)^2 = 225m^2 quad Rightarrow quad P equiv 1 pmod{4} ] Yet for five consecutive integers: [ n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4) notequiv 1 pmod{4} quad (text{Besides higher factorials}) ] 8. **Conclusion**: Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it follows that the product of five consecutive positive integers cannot be a perfect square.

Find the maximum possible number of forced terms in a regular sequence with 1000 terms.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the maximum number of forced terms in a regular sequence of 1000 terms. A sequence is regular if there exists a real number ( x ) such that ( leftlfloor kx rightrfloor = a_k ) for ( 1 le k le n ). A term ( a_k ) is forced if the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k-1}, b ) is regular if and only if ( b = a_k ). 2. **Claim:** The maximum possible number of forced terms is 985. This can be achieved by taking the sequence given by ( a_i = leftlfloor frac{i}{phi} rightrfloor ), where ( phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) is the golden ratio. 3. **Proof of Optimality:** To show that 985 is the maximum, we use the following critical claim: - A sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots ) of reals is normal if and only if ( a_i + a_j le a_{i+j} le a_i + a_j + 1 ) for all ( i, j in mathbb{N} ). 4. **Proof of the Claim:** - The \\"only if\\" direction follows from the properties of the floor function: ( leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor le leftlfloor a + b rightrfloor le leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor + 1 ). - For the \\"if\\" direction, we use induction on ( n ) to show that if the condition is satisfied for ( i + j le n ), then ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) is a prefix of a normal sequence. 5. **Base Case:** - When ( n = 1 ), the statement is trivially true. 6. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement holds for ( n = k ). If ( a_{k+1} ) is uniquely determined by the condition, then it must be ( leftlfloor x(k+1) rightrfloor ), and ( x ) still works for the first ( k+1 ) terms. - If ( a_{k+1} ) is not uniquely determined, we have ( a_1 + a_k = a_2 + a_{k-1} = cdots = a_k + a_1 ). Then, ( a_{k+1} ) is either ( a_i + a_{k+1-i} ) or ( a_i + a_{k+1-i} + 1 ). 7. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1:** ( leftlfloor x(k+1) rightrfloor = a_i + a_{k+1-i} ). We need to show that ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a_1 + a_k + 1 ) is regular. Let ( c = a_1 + a_k + 1 ). We claim that ( y = frac{c}{k+1} ) works, i.e., ( a_i = leftlfloor frac{ci}{k+1} rightrfloor ) for ( 1 le i le k+1 ). - **Case 2:** ( leftlfloor x(k+1) rightrfloor = a_i + a_{k+1-i} + 1 ). This case is analogous to Case 1. 8. **Conclusion:** - Using the above claim, ( a_n ) is unforced if and only if ( a_1 + a_{n-1} = a_2 + a_{n-2} = cdots = a_{n-1} + a_1 ) for ( 1 le n le 1000 ). - Consider the sequence ( {b_i} ) given by ( b_i = ix - a_i = {ix} ), where ( { } ) denotes the fractional part. An index ( 1 le i le 1000 ) is great if ( b_i ) is at least as large as each of ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{i-1} ), and puny if it is strictly smaller than each of ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{i-1} ). - Every great or puny index is non-forced. We need to show that at least 15 indices are either great or puny. 9. **Fibonacci Sequence Argument:** - If ( m ) is great and ( n ) is puny, then not all of ( max(m, n) + 1, ldots, m+n ) are ordinary. This implies that ( n_{i+2} le n_{i+1} + n_i ) for all ( 1 le i le t-2 ). - By induction, ( n_x le F_{x+1} ) for all ( x ), where ( F ) is the Fibonacci sequence. Since ( F_{16} = 987 < 1000 ), we conclude that the maximum number of forced terms is 985. The final answer is ( boxed{985} )."},{"prompt":"Which of the following surveys is most suitable for a comprehensive survey?

So, there are 2 solutions from the equation that are present in the set. The total number of elements in the set is 12.

This theorem states that the angle between a tangent to a circle and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. 3. **Expression of Angles**: According to the theorem, the angle angle ALP (between tangent AL and chord LP) is equal to angle XLC (since XL is a tangent at point L to the circumcircle of triangle BLC): [ angle ALP = angle XLC ] Moreover, since XL is tangent at L to the circumcircle of triangle BLC, and L is the point where BL (angle bisector) meets the circle, we have: [ angle XLC = angle LBC ] Consequently, we can write: [ angle ALP = angle LBC ] 4. **Another Angle Relation**: Recognize that angle PBL is an angle at the circumference standing on the same arc PL as angle LBC: [ angle LBC = angle PBL ] 5. **Final Angle Equalities**: From Steps 3 and 4, we have: [ angle ALP = angle LBC = angle PBL ] 6. **Application of Converse Theorem**: Using the converse of the tangent-secant angle theorem (angle between tangent and chord), if the measure of the angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord on the circle, then the tangent line touches the circle exactly at the point of tangency.

They are colored in the same color if the line connecting the two corners is inside a domino figure. We will use an inductive approach to prove this. 1. **Base Case:** Consider a single domino. A domino consists of two unit squares sharing a common edge. We can color the vertices of this domino as follows: - Let the vertices of the first square be colored as (1, 2, 3, 1) in a clockwise manner. - The vertices of the second square will then be (2, 3, 1, 2) in a clockwise manner. This ensures that the vertices on the shared edge have the same color, and the vertices on the boundary of the domino have different colors. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that for a region (mathcal{R}_k) composed of (k) dominoes, we have a valid coloring of the vertices. We need to show that we can extend this coloring to a region (mathcal{R}_{k+1}) composed of (k+1) dominoes. - Consider adding a new domino (D_{k+1}) to the region (mathcal{R}_k). The new domino will share an edge with the existing region (mathcal{R}_k). - The vertices of the new domino (D_{k+1}) can be colored in such a way that the shared edge vertices have the same color as the corresponding vertices in (mathcal{R}_k), and the other vertices of (D_{k+1}) are colored differently from their adjacent vertices in (mathcal{R}_k). 3. **Consistency of Coloring:** - The coloring of the vertices ensures that any two vertices with distance 1 on the border of two dominoes are colored differently. - Any two vertices with distance 1 inside a domino are colored the same. 4. **Algorithm for Coloring:** - Start with a single domino and color its vertices as described in the base case. - For each new domino added, color its vertices by matching the shared edge vertices with the existing region and ensuring the other vertices are colored differently from their adjacent vertices. 5. **Conclusion:** By induction, we can extend this coloring to any number of dominoes covering the rectangle.

To verify if a number (N_i) is a perfect square, one effective method is to examine the sum of its digits.

We have thus decomposed (x^{3p} + x^{3m+1} + x^{3n+2}) into sums of terms all divisible by (x^2 + x + 1). 6. **Conclusion for (p = m = n = 1)**: For (p = m = n = 1): [ x^{3p} + x^{3m+1} + x^{3n+2} = x^3 (1 + x + x^2) ] which is clearly divisible by (x^2 + x + 1). 7. **Generalization for arbitrary (p, m, n)**: Suppose for positive integers (p, m, n), (x^2 + x + 1) divides (x^{3p} + x^{3m+1} + x^{3n+2}), we show incrementing any of (p, m, n) by 1 still keeps the divisibility: [ x^{3(r+1)} - x^{3r} = x^{3r}(x^3 - 1) = x^{3r} (x-1) (x^2 + x + 1) ] Thus: [ x^{3(r+1)} = x^{3r} + x^{3r}(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) ] Demonstrates (x^{2} + x + 1) continues to be a divisor.

Volume of the removed pyramid is then calculated. The base area of the equilateral triangle can be found using the formula frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 where s = 2sqrt{2}.

By marking some of these points in red, we want to ensure that there are at least four red points forming the vertices of a square. What is the minimum number of points that need to be marked red? # Detailed Solution: 1. **Observation about Points on Circle**: - The points on the circle are equally spaced. - For a set of four points to form a square, the diagonals of the square must be perpendicular bisectors of each other and pass through the center of the circle. 2. **Dividing the Circle**: - Divide the circle into 100 equal segments. - This division creates 50 pairs of diametrically opposite points and, hence, 25 independent sets of perpendicular diameters, because each set of perpendicular diameters has four points equally spaced on the circumference forming the vertices of a square. 3. **Least Advantageous Red Marking Setup**: - To avoid forming a square, assume each set of four points forming perpendicular diameters has at most 3 red points. - Therefore, there are ( 3 times 25 = 75 ) red points, ensuring all 25 potential squares formed do not have all four vertices as red points. 4. **Ensuring a Square with All Red Vertices**: - To guarantee at least one square is completely red, add just one more red point to the setup with ( 75 ) red points. - This additional point ensures that at least one of the potential 25 squares formed has all four vertices marked red. 5. **Minimum Number of Red Points**: - Thus, the minimum number of red points needed to ensure that at least one square with all its vertices red is ( 75 + 1 = 76 ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{76} ]"},{"prompt":"When three positive integers are divided by 53, the remainders are 37, 14, and 7, respectively.

Substituting these points into the equation gives frac{y - 0}{6 - 0} = frac{x - (-4)}{0 - (-4)} Simplifying the fractions, we get frac{y}{6} = frac{x + 4}{4} Now, cross multiplying to clear the fractions: 4y = 6(x + 4) Distribute the 6 to both terms in the parenthesis: 4y = 6x + 24 To get the standard form of the line equation, we move all terms to one side: 6x - 4y + 24 = 0 Multiply each term by -1 to make the x coefficient positive: -6x + 4y - 24 = 0 or 3x - 2y + 12 = 0 Expressing the solution: [ boxed{3x - 2y + 12 = 0} ]"},{"prompt":"the diagram, (AB = 15 text{ cm}), (AC = 36 text{ cm}), and (angle A = 90^circ).

For the second term, notice that 133^circ = 180^circ - 47^circ, and sin(180^circ - x) = sin x, hence: frac {cos 88^circ}{sin 133^circ} = frac {cos 88^circ}{sin (180^circ - 47^circ)} = frac {cos 88^circ}{sin 47^circ} Now, we know that cos (90^circ - x) = sin x, so cos 88^circ = sin (90^circ - 88^circ) = sin 2^circ. Thus, the term becomes: frac {sin 2^circ}{sin 47^circ} Adding up the two terms: frac {cos 2^circ}{sin 47^circ} + frac {sin 2^circ}{sin 47^circ} = frac {cos 2^circ + sin 2^circ}{sin 47^circ} To simplify this expression, notice that cos 2^circ + sin 2^circ can be written as a rotation of the sum by 45^circ.

If the first statement is true, the second statement will be false, and vice versa. To simplify the logic without loss of generality, we'll assume that the first statement was false. 2. If the first statement is false, the first statement itself contributes to the count of false statements. 3. For the second statement to be a valid assertion that more than (70%) of prior statements are false, we need to ensure that the condition holds for the prior statement(s). Specifically, if the second statement claims that \\"more than (70%) of the statements made so far are false,\\" it will itself be false if there were only one statement before it (we assume the first one is false). 4. Given that this pattern holds, we can use the following logic to infer the nature of subsequent statements. We record the truth values of statements in sets of ten, as observed in the provided reference solution. 5. Let's list the first 11 statements under the assumption: [ text { L, I, L, L, I, L, L, I, L, L, L ... } ] Where 'L' stands for false (Liar) and 'I' stands for true (Integrity). 6. Continuing this pattern, we note that among the first 10 statements, there are exactly 7 false (L) statements. This proportion meets the assertion made in the 11th statement, which will therefore be false (L), as it would claim \\"more than (70%)\\" false among statements that were already mostly false. 7. By this repetitive pattern, each sequence of 10 statements follows: [ text { L, I, L, L, I, L, L, I, L, L, L } ] Repeating this pattern, we find that every set of 10 statements has the configuration 7 false and 3 true, maintaining the overall percentage of false statements. 8.

Thus, we exclude x = 2 and x = 4 from possible solutions. Simplifying the fraction for other values of x, we cancel out (x - 2)(x - 4)^2(x - 2) in both the numerator and the denominator: [(x - 1)^3(x - 3)^3 = 2.] Expanding and then simplifying, this results in: [(x - 1)(x - 3) = sqrt[3]{2}] Let's set y = (x - 1)(x - 3), thus y = sqrt[3]{2}.

Before reaching adulthood, two children passed away, and the survivors received an additional 3500 koronas each. How many children did the deceased have?","completion":"We are given that an inheritance of 84,000 koronas is to be equally divided among ( x ) children with the condition that if any child dies before reaching adulthood, their share is to be equally divided among the surviving children. Two children die, and the remaining children receive an additional 3,500 koronas each. To find the number of children ( x ), we set up the following equation: [ frac{84000}{x} + 3500 = frac{84000}{x-2} ] 1. Distribute the inheritance equally among ( x ) children: [ text{Share of each child} = frac{84000}{x} ] 2.
