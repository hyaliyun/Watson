Given a parallelogram (ABCD) with obtuse angle (A), - (H) is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point (A) to (BC). 2. Let (E) be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point (B) to (AD). It follows that the quadrilateral (AHBE) is a rectangle because: - The angles ( angle AHB ) and ( angle BHE ) are right angles by construction. 3. Since (AHBE) is a rectangle, the opposite angles are equal. Therefore, [ angle HED = angle ABC ] 4. Notice in parallelogram (ABCD): [ angle ABC = 180^circ - angle BCD ] Thus, it ensures that the points (D, C, H, E) lie on a circle ( omega ) as: - ( angle HED = 180^circ - angle BCD ) 5.

Since points (A, K, B, C) lie on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ), using Power of a Point theorem, we have: [ MK cdot MC = MA cdot MB ] 7. Additionally, since (M) is the midpoint of diagonal (BE) in rectangle (AHBE), [ MK cdot MC = MA cdot MB = MH cdot ME ] This equality confirms that points (C, K, H, E) lie on the same circle ( omega ). 8. Since circle ( omega ) already contains points (D, C, H, E) and point (K) as shown above: - Circle ( omega ) must also include points (K, H, C, D) because they share a common circle with at least three points being the same.

We have three keys to consider: A, B, and C. Let's analyze the effect of each key: 1. **Key A**: Increases the number by 3. 2. **Key B**: Multiplies the number by (-2). 3. **Key C**: Divides the number by 4. To maximize the number, we should first consider multiplying or adding to increase its value. Since we're starting with a negative number (-1), multiplying by a negative (Key B) will turn it positive, which is beneficial for maximizing. - **First Press (Key B)**: -1 times (-2) = 2. - **Second Press (Key A)**: After turning the number positive, adding will further increase its value. So, 2 + 3 = 5. Thus, the sequence to maximize the number displayed on the screen after pressing two keys in a row is B rightarrow A. # Part 2: Key Sequence A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow A rightarrow B rightarrow C ldots after 2023 Presses Given the sequence A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow A rightarrow B rightarrow C ldots and starting with -1, let's see the pattern: 1. **Pressing A**: -1 + 3 = 2. 2. **Pressing B**: 2 times (-2) = -4. 3. **Pressing C**: -4 div 4 = -1. After these three presses, the number returns to -1, indicating a cycle every 3 key presses.

So we have: [ m - c = 14 ] Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for ( c ) by adding the two equations together to eliminate ( m ): [ (m + c) + (m - c) = 20 + 14 ] [ 2m = 34 ] [ m = 17 ] Now that we have ( m ), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find ( c ).

According to the information given, John finishes cleaning half the house in ( frac{1}{3}t ). Since John cleans the entire house in 6 hours, cleaning half the house would take him ( frac{6}{2} = 3 ) hours. So, we have: [ frac{1}{3}t = 3 ] [ t = 3 times 3 ] [ t = 9 ] This means Nick takes 9 hours to clean the entire house alone. Now, let's calculate the rate at which John and Nick clean the house when working together. John's rate is ( frac{1}{6} ) of the house per hour (since he takes 6 hours to clean the entire house), and Nick's rate is ( frac{1}{9} ) of the house per hour. When they work together, their rates add up: [ text{Combined rate} = frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{9} ] To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 18 in this case: [ text{Combined rate} = frac{3}{18} + frac{2}{18} ] [ text{Combined rate} = frac{5}{18} ] This means together they clean ( frac{5}{18} ) of the house per hour.

Let's denote the width of Carol's rectangle as W inches. The area of Carol's rectangle is then: Area = Length × Width 120 square inches = 5 inches × W To find W, we divide both sides of the equation by 5 inches: W = 120 square inches / 5 inches W = 24 inches Therefore, the width of Carol's rectangle is boxed{24} inches."},{"prompt":"Among the following judgments: (1) The proposition If q then p and If not p then not q are contrapositives of each other; (2) am<sup>2</sup> < bm<sup>2</sup> is a necessary and sufficient condition for a < b; (3) The negation of the proposition The diagonals of a rectangle are equal is a false proposition; (4) The proposition ∅⊆{1,2} is true, the correct sequence numbers are.","completion":"Based on the definition of contrapositive, (1) is correct; Since when m=0, m<sup>2</sup>=0, if a<b then am<sup>2</sup><bm<sup>2</sup> is a false proposition, hence (2) is incorrect; Since the negation is: The diagonals of a quadrilateral that is not a rectangle are not equal, and the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are equal, which is not a rectangle, hence (3) is incorrect; Since ∅ is a subset of any set, therefore (4) is correct; Thus, the answer is boxed{(1)(4)}."},{"prompt":"Sasha and Masha each thought of a natural number and told them to Vasya.

Depending on (n), determine which wizard has a winning strategy.","completion":"To determine which wizard has a winning strategy depending on n, we will analyze the given scenario step-by-step. 1. **Game Setup**: - The game is played on a square grid of side length 2n + 1 meters. - The center of the square is where the toad initially sits. - The lava surrounds the boundary of this square. - The toad moves d meters, where (d) starts at 1 and increases by 1 after each move. - Albus starts, and the wizards alternate turns. 2. **Brian's Strategy**: - Brian wins irrespective of n because he can adopt a mirroring strategy. - This means for every move Albus makes in one direction, Brian makes an equal move in the opposite direction. 3. **Analyzing Brian's Strategy**: - Consider any move Albus makes. Suppose he moves the toad d meters in a specific direction. - Brian will then move the toad d meters in the opposite direction on his turn. 4. **Mathematical Reasoning**: - Any strategy where Brian mirrors Albus's moves will result in the toad returning to its previous position before Albus’s move. - After each pair of turns, the total displacement in any direction is nullified (resulting in zero net movement) because Brian always moves the toad back to where it was before Albus's move. - Algebraically, if Albus moves by distance d, then Brian moves by distance -d, so the total displacement after each pair of turns remains zero. 5. **Conclusion from the above points**: - If the toad were to move off the board, this would mean that the toad must have been right at the edge following any turn from Brian. - For this reasoning, consider that the minimum number of combined jumps (one from each wizard per round) is at least 2n. - Let's examine the case: if Albus's final move sends the toad out, before this move, Brian's final turn would have needed to place the toad exactly at the edge of the square. - Given the increasing distance d = 2n + 1, it is certain that it will cover the edge or outside after at most (2n+1) moves. Thus, following the mirroring strategy, Brian will always make pressured moves, resulting in Albus making the final (losing) move that sends the toad into the lava.

The correct identity should be: cos left(frac{3π}{2} - αright) = sin α Now we can correctly find the value of sin α: sin α = frac{1}{3} Next, we find the value of cos α using the Pythagorean identity: cos α = -sqrt{1-sin^2 α} = -sqrt{1-left(frac{1}{3}right)^2} = -frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} Finally, we substitute the value of cos α in the simplified expression for f(α): f(α)=-frac{1}{cos α}=-frac{1}{-frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}=boxed{frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}}"},{"prompt":"A circle with a radius of 2cm, its circumference and area are ( ) A: Equal B: Circumference is greater C: Numerically equal, but units differ D","completion":"Solution: The circumference of the circle: 3.14 times 2 times 2 = 3.14 times 4 = 12.56 (CM); The area of the circle: 3.14 times 2^2 = 3.14 times 4 = 12.56 (CM^2); Therefore, the numerical values are equal, but the units are different.

The vertices of this trapezoid are at (1,6), (7,0), (1,0), and approximately at (0,7) (though this last point is not included as x must be at least 1). 3. **Counting Rational Points**: As both x and y must be positive rational numbers and given the dense nature of rational numbers, for any rational x geq 1, there are infinitely many rational y values such that x + y leq 7. For instance, if x = 1, then y can take any rational value from a small positive number up to 6. This reasoning holds as x increases, until x = 7 where y must be 0 (but y must be positive, hence x cannot be 7). 4. **Conclusion**: Given the infinite density of rational numbers, there are infinitely many rational points (x, y) where 1 leq x leq 7 and x + y leq 7.

This notation indicates a mean (mu) of 80 and a variance (sigma^2) of 25. Given the definition of a grade A score as 85 or higher, we are interested in finding P(Xge 85). To compute this probability from a normal distribution, we typically use standard normal distribution tables or a calculator. However, the solution provided uses a property of the normal distribution, which is its symmetry, and knowledge of the empirical rule. The empirical rule, or the 68-95-99.7 rule, for a normal distribution states that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (sigma) of the mean (mu), 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. The calculation in the solution creatively applies this rule. The probability of scoring between 75 and 85 (which is one standard deviation from the mean, 80, since sigma=5) encompasses approximately 68.27% of the distribution, per the empirical rule. Therefore, P(75le X<85) approx 0.6827. The solution then exploits the symmetry of the normal distribution to calculate the probability of scoring 85 or higher as follows: [P(Xge 85)=frac{1}{2}[1-P(75le X<85)]] Substituting the known value: [P(Xge 85)=frac{1}{2}[1-0.6827]=frac{1-0.6827}{2}] [P(Xge 85)=frac{0.3173}{2}=0.15865] Thus, the probability of randomly selecting a student who took the exam and obtaining a grade of A is 0.15865.

By the definition of a midline, we know that A_1C_1 = frac{1}{2}AC and it is parallel to AC. 2. **Find the midpoint of the midline**: - Let M be the midpoint of A_1C_1. Since A_1C_1 is parallel to AC and M is the midpoint, we have MA_1 = MC_1 and M projects perpendicularly onto a point on AC. Let's denote this projection as B_1. 3. **Project M onto AC**: - Since angle A and angle C are acute, the perpendicular from M to AC will fall inside the segment AC. 4. **Create the cuts**: - We now need to make two cuts along B_1A_1 and B_1C_1: - Draw line segment B_1C_1. - Draw line segment B_1A_1. 5. **Analyze the resulting triangles**: - Consider Delta A_1B_1C_1: - In Delta A_1B_1C_1, M is both the median and altitude, so B_1M is perpendicular to A_1C_1. - By definition of the perpendicular bisector, A_1B_1 = C_1B_1, making Delta A_1B_1C_1 isosceles. 6. **Symmetrical points construction**: - Let P be the point symmetrical to B_1 over A_1, and Q be the point symmetrical to B_1 over C_1. - Consider triangles BQA_1 and CB_1A_1. Because they are symmetrical with respect to A_1 and C_1, respectively, these segments are equal. - Hence, triangles AQC_1 (or AC_1B_1) and BC_1Q are congruent as well. 7. **Forming the isosceles triangle**: - With the cuts along B_1A_1 and B_1C_1, triangle P B_1 Q has sides B_1C_1, B_1A_1 which are exactly half the lengths of the sides of the larger triangle. This symmetry results in Delta P B_1 Q being an isosceles triangle because B_1C_{1} = B_1A_{1}.

Hence, (ef) (product of even numbers) is divisible by 8. - If at least one of (a, b, c, d) is even, the product (abcdef) is divisible by at least one more factor of 2, making it divisible by 8. 3. **Divisibility by 3:** Analyze modulo 3: [ x^2 equiv 0 text{ or } 1 pmod{3} ] Hence sums of five squares can only be 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 equiv 0, 1, 2 pmod{3} ] For (f^2) to also hold modulo 3 properties: - If (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 equiv 0 pmod{3}): (f equiv 0 pmod{3},) Consequently, (f) must be a multiple of 3, ensuring (abcdef) is divisible by 3.

To solve this, let's interpret the given expression differently. 1. **Understanding the expression geometrically**: The given expression can be rewritten and interpreted in terms of distances from point ((3, 2)) to two lines given in the coordinate system. 2. **Rewrite the expression as distances**: Consider the expression as (2(d_1 + d_2)) where (d_1) and (d_2) are the distances from the point (A(3,2)) to the lines (ell_1) and (ell_2) respectively. The lines are specified by the equations: [ ell_1 : a x - b y = 0 ] and [ ell_2 : (a + bsqrt{3})x + (asqrt{3} - b)y = 0. ] 3. **Calculate angle between lines**: Find the angle (varphi) between the lines (ell_1) and (ell_2) using the cosine formula for the angle between two lines: [ cos varphi = frac{a(a + bsqrt{3}) - b(asqrt{3} - b)}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot sqrt{(a + bsqrt{3})^2 + (asqrt{3} - b)^2}} ] Simplify the numerator: [ a(a + bsqrt{3}) - b(asqrt{3} - b) = a^2 + absqrt{3} - absqrt{3} + b^2 = a^2 + b^2 ] Simplify the denominator: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot sqrt{(a + b sqrt{3})^2 + (a sqrt{3} - b)^2} ] Simplify ((a + b sqrt{3})^2 + (a sqrt{3} - b)^2): [ (a + b sqrt{3})^2 + (a sqrt{3} - b)^2 = a^2 + 2absqrt{3} + 3b^2 + 3a^2 - 2absqrt{3} + b^2 = 4a^2 + 4b^2 ] So the denominator is: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot sqrt{4a^2 + 4b^2} = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot 2 sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2(a^2 + b^2) ] 4. **Plug back in**: [ cos varphi = frac{a^2 + b^2}{2(a^2 + b^2)} = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, (varphi = frac{pi}{3}). 5. **Consider distances**: Assume point (A) to be inside the angle between (ell_1) and (ell_2). Let (alpha) be the angle between (ell_1) and line segment (AB) (where (B) is on (ell_2)). Then (alpha in [0, frac{pi}{3}]).

There are 12 months in a year, so a 5-year loan period has 5 * 12 = 60 months. Quincy's monthly payment is 250.00, so over 60 months, he will pay a total of 250 * 60 = 15,000. The price of the car is 20,000, and Quincy will pay 15,000 over the loan period. The difference between the price of the car and the amount paid over the loan period is the down payment. Down payment = Price of the car - Total amount paid over the loan period Down payment = 20,000 - 15,000 Down payment = 5,000 Quincy's down payment was boxed{5,000} ."},{"prompt":"A bike and a truck took some hours to cover 72 and 72 miles distance respectively.

Calculate the total percentage of savings spent in February and March: - February: 20% - March: 40% - Total spent in February and March: 20% + 40% = 60% 2. Determine what percentage of her savings was left after spending in February and March: - Total savings = 100% - Spent in February and March = 60% - Left for April expenses and what remains: 100% - 60% = 40% 3. Calculate the total amount for April expenses and the money left in her account: - April expenses: 1500 - Money left after all expenses: 2900 - Total for April expenses and what remains: 2900 + 1500 = 4400 4. Since 4400 represents the 40% of her savings that was left for April expenses and what remained, we can find the value of 1% of her savings: - 4400 = 40% - Value of 1% of savings: frac{4400}{40} = 110 5.

Additionally, Agent Apelsin cannot visit the same village twice, nor can he visit two directly connected villages consecutively. 1. **Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure** - The given structure forms a tree because for any two villages, there is exactly one unique path connecting them. This ensures there are no cycles. - Since there are 2020 villages, a tree with 2020 nodes has exactly 2019 edges. 2. **Step 2: Confirm the Inability to Visit All Villages** - Suppose Agent Apelsin tries to visit all 2020 villages. He must make sure he doesn't visit any two directly connected villages consecutively. - This restriction implies there is a need to omit at least one village in the worst-case scenario because, in the acyclic graph of n nodes, one must necessarily encounter leaf nodes which limit further paths without repetition. 3. **Step 3: Construct a Plan for Visiting the Villages** - Agent Apelsin starts from any arbitrary village. - From each village, he moves to any village that adheres to the rule of not revisiting and not visiting directly connected nodes consecutively. - Let's attempt to visit as many villages as possible. Given the constraints: - From each village, choose the next village ensuring it adheres to the stated rules. - Consider a strategy: - Start from a randomly selected village. - Move to any permissible village following the aforementioned constraint until no further move is possible. 4. **Step 4: Evaluate the Maximum Possible Villages** - In the worst-case scenario of having to respect the given rules in an acyclic connection (a tree): - Suppose the plan allows visiting ( n ) villages without breaking the rules. - The remaining villages (in the worst, this would be one, since breaking the rule means a blockage by direct connections limiting further paths) would not be visited. # Conclusion Given these allowances and constraints, Agent Apelsin is guaranteed to visit all but one of the 2020 villages.

The total number of cells on this board is: [ 13 times 13 = 169 ] 2. After removing two opposite corner cells, the total number of cells left is: [ 169 - 2 = 167 ] 3. We need to place kings on several marked cells such that each king covers all empty cells in its respective marked positions, and the total number of kings does not exceed 47. 4. We divide the 13 times 13 board into 47 disjoint areas, each consisting of 3 adjacent cells. These can fit into the board because: [ 3 times 47 = 141 quad text{(number of cells to be covered)} ] Note that not all areas will have exactly 3, but in total, we'll cover 47 cells using 47 kings maximally. 5. Each king covers the cells adjacent to its own, which include cells along vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines. Therefore, placing one king in one of the cells of each of these areas ensures that all other cells in these areas are covered. 6. Since each area contains 3 cells and each cell is considered adjacent to the cells covered by the same king, we need to mark one cell from each area where a king is placed. 7. By selectively placing the kings in the designated cells mentioned above, the condition of \\"no more than 47 kings\\" and that all remaining empty cells are covered by at least one king is satisfied. 8. Therefore, the optimal number of kings required is indeed achievable.

So, assume ( M ) is larger than ( T ). 2. **Consider three copies of ( T ):** Take three copies of ( T ): ( AB_AC_A ), ( A_BBC_B ), and ( A_CB_CC ), where ( A, B, C ) are the vertices of ( M ) and ( B_A, C_A, A_B, C_B, A_C, B_C ) lie on the edges of ( M ). 3. **Define subsets of points:** Define three subsets of points: [ X_A = X setminus AB_AC_A quad text{(points in ( X ) that aren't covered by ( AB_AC_A ))}. ] Similarly, define ( X_B ) and ( X_C ). 4. **Lemma:** If a translation of triangle ( T ), call it ( T' ), contains two points from ( {x_A, x_B, x_C} ), say ( x_A ) and ( x_B ), then it cannot contain any point from ( X_C ). **Proof of Lemma:** Since ( x_A ) and ( x_B ) lie on different edges of ( M ), the only way for ( T' ) to cover both of them is if it contains the point ( C ). This means that the edge of ( T' ) parallel to ( AB ) lies below the line ( A_CB_C ) (of triangle ( CA_CB_C )), so it cannot contain any point of ( X_C ). (blacksquare) 5. **Smallest triangles containing subsets:** Take the smallest triangles ( M_A, M_B, M_C ) that contain ( X_A, X_B, X_C ) respectively. Each edge of ( M_A ) contains a point of ( X ), one of which is ( x_A ), and similarly for ( M_B ) and ( M_C ). 6. **Covering points with two copies of ( T ):** In total, there are at most 9 such points, so they can be covered by two copies of ( T ). By the pigeonhole principle, one of those two copies contains at least two points from ( {x_A, x_B, x_C} ), say ( x_A ) and ( x_B ). Therefore, it follows from the lemma that no points from ( X_C ) are covered by the first triangle. Hence, the second triangle covers all of ( X_C ). 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the second triangle and ( AB_AC_A ) must cover all points in ( X ). This completes the proof.

Step 6: The maximum value of the given expression is therefore: frac{2}{4sqrt{2}-4} = frac{2}{4(sqrt{2}-1)} = frac{sqrt{2}+1}{2} Hence, the answer is: boxed{frac{sqrt{2}+1}{2}}."},{"prompt":"Construct a rightangled triangle given the hypotenuse and the projection of one of the legs onto the hypotenuse.","completion":"Let's solve the problem step-by-step, detailing every part of the construction for the given conditions: 1. **Given Elements**: - Hypotenuse of a right triangle, denote it as overline{AB}. - Projection of one of the legs (catheti) onto the hypotenuse, denote it as p. 2. **Construct a Circle**: - Draw the hypotenuse overline{AB}. - Use overline{AB} as the diameter to construct a circle. Note that since overline{AB} is the diameter, the angle subtended by any point on the circumference to overline{AB} will be a right angle (by the Thales' theorem). 3. **Locate the Projection Point**: - Measure a length equal to p on the hypotenuse overline{AB}. Let's place this length such that point C on overline{AB} marks the end of this segment from A. Therefore, overline{AC} = p where C is the projection point. overline{AC} = p 4. **Draw the Perpendicular**: - From point C, construct a perpendicular line to overline{AB}. This is done using standard geometric construction methods (like using a compass). - Extend this perpendicular line until it intersects with the circle. The point of intersection is denoted as D. 5. **Form the Right Triangle**: - The points A, B, and D now form a right triangle. - Since D lies on the circle and A and B are the endpoints of the diameter, the angle angle ADB is a right angle (by the Thales' theorem). Therefore, triangle ABD is the required triangle. - For verification, CD is another leg of the right triangle triangle ABD, and accordingly, overline{AC} being the projection of overline{AD} onto overline{AB} is correct by construction. # Conclusion: Based on the step-by-step geometric construction, we have successfully constructed a right triangle given the hypotenuse overline{AB} and a projection p of one leg.

To find the radius (R), we use the distance from a point to a line formula. We can choose one of the asymptotes, for instance, the one with the positive slope y = frac{b}{a}x to find the distance from the right focus to the asymptote: R = frac{|by - ax|}{sqrt{b^2 + a^2}} Substituting the right focus coordinates (c, 0) into the equation, we get: R = frac{|b cdot 0 - a cdot c|}{sqrt{b^2 + a^2}} = frac{|-ac|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{ac}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} Now, substituting c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, the radius simplifies to: R = frac{asqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = a However, we have to reconsider this result since the hyperbola's right focus is located at (+c,0), and we found that c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem**: - We need to maximize the count of triplets ( (a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}) ) where the sum is odd. - Since (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2021}) is a permutation of (1, 2, ldots, 2021), the sequence has 1011 odd numbers and 1010 even numbers. 2. **Construct an Exemplary Sequence**: - A possible construction that maximizes the count of big three elements is to place odd and even numbers alternately. - Pattern: \`100100100...111...1\`, where \`1\` represents odd numbers and \`0\` represents even numbers. 3. **Transformation to Numbers**: - If we alternate \\"0\\" (even) and \\"1\\" (odd) for 505 groups, followed by 511 ones (remaining odd numbers): [ a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 4, ldots, a_{1009} = 1009, a_{1010} = 1010, a_{1011} = 1011, ldots, a_{1516} = 2019, a_{1517} = 2020, a_{1518} = 2021 ] 4. **Verify the Number of Big Three Elements**: - The alternating pattern \`100\` yields (2019 - 3 + 1 = 2019) positions where three consecutive positions can be examined. - Out of the (2019) consecutive three-number sums, \`2018\` will be odd (valid big three elements), and the last one won't be a big three element due to the odd count breakdown. 5. **Proof by Contradiction for General Case**: - Suppose every set of three consecutive terms (a_{k}, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}) are consecutive other than as alternating odd and even placements. - If for refutation, every sum (a_{i} + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2}) were odd, one can see via: [ a_{k}+a_{k+1}+a_{k+2} quad text{and} quad a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+a_{k+3} ] all being odd implies repeating (a_k) pattern in 2021 sequence lead to contradictions as even-odd placement breaks. By ensuring all sequences derive evenly from subsets 1,2...2021 ensure maximum big three elements is best and linearized construction validate. 6. **Conclusion**: - Assembly of the entire permutation as followed confirms the observation of combination cannot exceed more than (2018) valid big three elements.

In the next level of division, one-sixteenth of the entire square (because one-fourth of one-fourth) is shaded, and this pattern follows. 3. **Summing the Series:** The shaded area forms a geometric series where the first term (a = frac{1}{4}) (area of the shaded portion in the initial division), and the ratio (r = frac{1}{16}) (as each subsequent shaded area is one-fourth of the area of the previously shaded square). The sum (S) of the series is calculated using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series: [ S = frac{a}{1 - r} = frac{frac{1}{4}}{1 - frac{1}{16}} = frac{frac{1}{4}}{frac{15}{16}} = frac{1}{4} cdot frac{16}{15} = frac{4}{15} ] Thus, the fractional part of the figure that is shaded is (boxed{frac{4}{15}})."},{"prompt":"Given point P(x,y) is in the second quadrant, and |x| = 2, y is the square root of 1, then the coordinates of point P are _______________.","completion":"The condition for a point to be in the second quadrant is: the x-coordinate is negative, and the y-coordinate is positive.

Since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers and both have exactly ( m ) positive divisors, it is evident that ( a_{1} = 1 ) because ( 1 ) is a divisor of every integer. 3. Observing the elements in set ( B ), we have: [ a_{i} + a_{i+1} geqslant 3 quad text{for } i = 1,2, ldots, m-1 ] This implies that ( 2 ) cannot be an element of ( B ).

Given ( a_{1} = 1 ), which is odd, it follows that ( a_{2} ) must be even for their sum to be odd. 5.

This indicates that every player is able to reach at least one additional player by adding one more game, suggesting that the directed graph must be strongly connected. In other words, from each player, it's possible to reach every other player through a path of directed edges in no more than 11 steps, as required. Notice a specific path: [ A_1 rightarrow A_2 rightarrow A_3 rightarrow cdots rightarrow A_{11} rightarrow A_{12} ] Here, player (A_1) wins against (A_2), (A_2) wins against (A_3), and so forth, concluding with (A_{11}) winning against (A_{12}). Ensuring reachability to every other player implicates that: - If a player in this series was able to win against some other player before (A_{11}), it could reduce the series of connections needed, invalidating the strongly connected property within the stipulated limit. Thus, no player (A_i) (where (1 < i < 12)) wins against (A_1), or it would imply reaching (A_1) would take less than 11 steps. However, at least one player must have won against (A_1); otherwise, (A_1) wouldn’t be reachable by others: - By construction and cyclical nature, apparent closer (A_{12}) must have defeated (A_1). It can be shown iteratively that in the designated constructed solitary cycle, each (A_i) (except first initiator (A_1)) wins against the next in order. This construction leads to the conclusion: [ text{Total individual victories} = 12 ] Remaining to consider: [ text{Total games} = binom{12}{2} = 66 ( text{total combination of collected games played in pairs} ) ] The total draws: [ text{Number of Draws} = binom{12}{2} - text{Total individual victories} = 66 - 12 = 54 ] Thus, there were ( boxed{54} ) draws in the tournament."},{"prompt":"Given that the terminal side of angle theta passes through point P(4a,3a) where (a < 0).

For each chord, the product of the segments they are divided into by ( Z ) is constant, say ( m ). - Let ( Z ) divide one chord into segments of length ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Then ( x_1 + x_2 = a ) and ( x_1 x_2 = m ). - This implies ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are roots of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - ax + m = 0 ). Since a quadratic equation has at most two real roots, this implies that each chord, when passed through point ( Z ), must split into precisely the same segments ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). This leads to a contradiction if we assert more than two chords, meaning the point ( Z ) (other than the center) cannot determine more than two equal chords. 3. **Auxiliary Proposition Proof – Geometric Method**: Equal chords in a circle subtend equal arcs, which are transformed into each other by rotation about the center ( O ). - This implies all such chords are equidistant from ( O ), touching some circle centered at ( O ). - From any point, you can draw at most two tangents to a circle, indicating it's impossible for three equal chords to all pass through such a point. 4. **Symmetry Argument for Our Specific Problem**: The symmetry around line ( OM ): - Be it any chord like ( AB ), through symmetry relative to line ( OM ), transforms into another chord of the same length. - Given ( PQ ) is another such chord from ( AB ) under this symmetry, we find ( angle OMA = angle OMQ = alpha ). Similarly, applying symmetry relative to line ( OK ): - This gives ( angle OKP = angle OKD = beta ). 5. **Angle Calculation**: Combining the results of these symmetries: [ angle KOM = 180^circ - (alpha + beta). ] For angle ( BLD ): - ( angle KLB = angle LMK + angle LKM ) - Using symmetry results, [ angle KLB = 180^circ - 2alpha + 180^circ - 2beta = 360^circ - 2(alpha + beta). ] This shows: [ angle BLD = 2 times angle KOM. ] In conclusion, [ angle MOK = frac{1}{2} angle BLD. ] Thus, we have shown that ( angle MOK = frac{1}{2} angle BLD ): [ boxed{text{Proven}} ]"},{"prompt":"f set M={0,1}, and I={0,1,2,3,4,5}, then C_IM is ( ) A: {0,1} B: {2,3,4,5} C: {0,2,3,4,5} D: {1,2,3,4,5}","completion":"Since set M={0,1}, and I={0,1,2,3,4,5}, then C_IM={2,3,4,5}, therefore, the correct option is boxed{text{B}}."},{"prompt":"The integers 1, 2, dots, n are written in order on a long slip of paper.

We calculate the sum of residues modulo 16: - Residues appearing once each: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, - Additional terms are the next 7 odd numbers starting again from 1: 1, 3, 5, 7. Calculating these sums: - Sum of all one-time residues = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64, - Sum of additional terms = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. Adding them gives 64 + 16 = 80.

Let's denote the points where the altitudes of the acute triangle (ABC) meet the circumcircle again (different from the vertices) as (A_2), (B_2), and (C_2). These points are commonly known as the ex-symmedian points or the reflections of the vertices across the opposite sides. 2. Since the line segment (AA_2) is perpendicular to side (BC) and is a chord in the circumcircle of (ABC), the perpendicular bisector of (AA_2), denoted as (f_a), passes through the center (O) of the circumcircle and is also perpendicular to the perpendicular bisector of side (BC). 3. To determine the reflection of point (A_2) about point (O), utilize the property that a reflection over a point (O) can be achieved by two successive reflections over the axes passing through (O) and meeting at (O) at right angles. Therefore, if we first reflect (A_2) across (f_a) (producing point (A)), and then reflect (A) across the perpendicular bisector of (BC), we obtain point (A_1), which is the reflection of (A_2) over (O). 4. Following the same procedure, the points (B_2) and (C_2) are reflected across the point (O) to yield the points (B_1) and (C_1), respectively. 5. Thus, the triangle (A_1B_1C_1) is the reflection of triangle (A_2B_2C_2) about point (O). 6. Let (K) be the incenter of (Delta A_1B_1C_1). Then the reflection of (K) about point (O) will correspond to the incenter (L) of (Delta A_2B_2C_2). 7. We observe that point (O) bisects the line segment joining (K) and (L). 8. Therefore, to show that (O) bisects (MK), it is sufficient to demonstrate that point (M) (the orthocenter of (Delta ABC)) coincides with point (L) (the incenter of (Delta A_2B_2C_2)). 9. Now, consider the angle relationships: since (BB_2 perp AC) and (CC_2 perp AB), we have the angles [ angle ABB_2 = 90^circ - alpha quad text{and} quad angle ACC_2 = 90^circ - alpha ] 10. Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the circumcircle, we further have [ angle AA_2B_2 = angle ABB_2 quad text{and} quad angle AA_2C_2 = angle ACC_2 ] 11. Consequently, we deduce that [ angle AA_2B_2 = angle AA_2C_2 ] indicating that (AA_2) bisects the angle (B_2A_2C_2). 12. Similarly, we can show that (BB_2) and (CC_2) also bisect the respective angles. 13. Therefore, (Delta A_2B_2C_2) has its angle bisectors coinciding with the altitudes of (Delta ABC). 14. Hence, the incenter of (Delta A_2B_2C_2) is the orthocenter (M) of (Delta ABC). 15. Therefore, (L = M), and since (O) bisects the line segment (KL), we have [ O text{ bisects } MK, ] as required.

Therefore, we have: [ x_{n+2} = 14x_{n}. ] 6.

To find the monotonicity intervals for y = g(x), whose domain is (0, +infty), we start by finding the derivative of g(x): g'(x) = frac{(3x-2)(x-2)}{4x}. The function g(x) is increasing where g'(x) > 0, which is when 0 < x < frac{2}{3} or x > 2. Similarly, g(x) is decreasing where g'(x) < 0, i.e., frac{2}{3} < x < 2. Therefore, g(x) is monotonically increasing on the intervals (0, frac{2}{3}) and (2, +infty), and monotonically decreasing on the interval (frac{2}{3}, 2). 2. To show g(x) has a zero in (e^n, +infty), we need e^n < frac{2}{3} and f(e^n) leq 0. Since g(e^{-1}) > 0 and g(e^{-2}) < 0, it follows that g(e^n) < 0 for any n leq -2 and n in mathbb{Z}.

We can think of this strip as a (1 times k) strip with an additional unit square added to the right. - We can create partitions of the (1 times (k+1)) strip by extending partitions of the (1 times k) strip in several ways: - No new segments are added in the new unit square. - A diagonal segment is added from ((k,0)) to ((k+1,1)). - A diagonal segment is added from ((k,1)) to ((k+1,0)). - Both diagonal segments are added, forming an \\"X\\" in the new unit square. 4. **Counting Partitions:** - For each partition of the (1 times k) strip, we have 4 possible ways to extend it to a partition of the (1 times (k+1)) strip (as described above). - Therefore, the number of partitions of the (1 times (k+1)) strip without vertical segments is (4f(k)). 5. **Partitions with Vertical Segments:** - Consider the partitions where the leftmost vertical segment has (x)-coordinate equal to (j) (where (1 leq j leq k)). - This vertical segment divides the strip into a (1 times j) strip and a (1 times (k+1-j)) strip. - The number of partitions of the (1 times (k+1)) strip with the leftmost vertical segment at (x = j) is (f(j-1) cdot f(k+1-j)). 6. **Combining All Partitions:** - Summing over all possible positions of the leftmost vertical segment, we get: [ f(k+1) = 4f(k) + sum_{j=1}^{k} f(j-1) cdot f(k+1-j) ] - By the induction hypothesis, (2^k mid f(k)) and (2^{j-1} mid f(j-1)) for all (j). - Therefore, each term in the sum is divisible by (2^{k+1}). 7. **Conclusion:** - Since (4f(k)) is divisible by (2^{k+2}) and each term in the sum is divisible by (2^{k+1}), it follows that (f(k+1)) is divisible by (2^{k+1}).

We need to prove that the circumradius of ( triangle A'B'C' ) is half the radius of ( odot I ). 2. **Key Concept - Radical Axis:** Recall that two circles intersect orthogonally if and only if the tangents from the intersection points are equal in length, and this orthogonal intersection implies that the power of the intersection points with respect to both circles is equal. Let ( r ) be the radius of the incircle ( odot I ). 3. **Intersection Points and Radical Axis:** Let ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ) be the points where ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) touch the incircle ( odot I ).

Therefore, the circle through points ( B, Q, R, C ) makes ( I ) exterior to this circle with intersection at ( B ) and ( C ). 7. **Circumscribed Circle of Triangle ( triangle PQR ):** Applying the same reasoning, (odot BQR ) intersects ( odot I ) orthogonally, and similar orthogonal intersections hold for circles through ( odot CRPA ) and ( odot APQB ).

A sequence of k identical outcomes (either heads or tails) in a row during coin tosses will be referred to as a k-series.

We denote this number as A_{n, k}, noting that if n < k, then A_{n, k}=0. 3. By symmetry, the number of k-series starting with tails is also A_{n, k}. 4.

This sum only undergoes a parallel translation as a result. Thus, the shape of a figure (curve), which is the sum of two figures (curves), does not depend on the choice of origin; it also does not change under parallel translation of the summands. However, rotation of the summands can significantly alter the sum: for instance, in Fig. 54a, the sum of two equal triangles is depicted, whereas in Fig. 54b, the sum of the same triangles, with one rotated by an angle of 180^circ, is shown. Note that the shape of the curve, which is the sum of the curve K and the circle O_{r} of radius r, does not depend on the position of the summands in the plane. This is due to the fact that a simultaneous rotation of both summands K_{1} and K_{2} by the same angle obviously results only in a rotation of the sum K_{1} + K_{2} by the same angle. Thus, when the curve K is rotated by some angle, the sum K + O_{r} does not change, it only rotates by the same angle. Now let K_{1} and K_{2} be two convex curves, with a counterclockwise direction specified (Fig. 55); let l_{1} and l_{2} be support lines of the curves K_{1} and K_{2}, parallel to each other and having the same direction; let A_{1} and A_{2} be the points of contact of the line l_{1} with the curve K_{1}, and similarly l_{2} with K_{2} (any of the points of contact if the support line has a common segment with the curve). Then we say that the points A_{1} and A_{2} are corresponding points of the curves K_{1} and K_{2}. For each point on one of the curves, there is a corresponding point on the other curve. Another definition of the sum of convex curves: Let K_{1} and K_{2} be two convex curves.

Let us perform a parallel translation of K_1 while keeping K_2 and the origin (O) fixed. 2. **Define Translation Vector**: Let (OA) be a vector from the origin to the translated position, which is equal in length and direction to the translation performed on K_1. Let the translated version of K_1 be denoted as K_1^{prime}, and the shapes Phi_1, Phi_2, and Phi_1^{prime} be the shapes bounded by K_1, K_2, and K_1^{prime} respectively. 3. **Consider Points in Figures**: Let (P) be a point in the shape Phi_1, and (Q) be a point in the shape Phi_2. Let (P^{prime}) be the translated position of (P) after the parallel transfer. By definition of parallel translation, we have: [ P^{prime} = P + A ] 4. **Sum of Points After Translation**: Considering the properties of point addition and parallel translation, the sum (P^{prime} + Q) can be written as: [ P^{prime} + Q = (P + A) + Q = (P + Q) + A ] This equality demonstrates that the figure Phi_1^{prime} + Phi_2 can be obtained from Phi_1 + Phi_2 by a parallel translation by vector (A). 5. **General Parallel Translation**: Similarly, if we keep Phi_1 fixed and perform a parallel translation on Phi_2, the sum Phi_1 + Phi_2 undergoes a corresponding parallel translation which matches both in direction and magnitude the translation applied to Phi_2. ![Figure Explanation](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_03412fca680f64158016g-202.jpg?height=558&width=595&top_left_y=453&top_left_x=482) 6. **Summation with Origin and Parallel Translation**: If we translate both the figures Phi_1 and Phi_2, as well as the origin (O), by the same translation vector, the resultant sum Phi_1 + Phi_2 will also undergo the same parallel translation. Lastly, when both figures Phi_1 and Phi_2 are translated by different translation vectors such that they transform into figures Phi_1^{prime} and Phi_2^{prime}, and simultaneously we move the origin (O) to a new point (O^{prime}), we can achieve the required translated positions by first moving the entire setup to O^{prime}, followed by applying the necessary translations. Therefore, the resultant sum transforms according to these translations, illustrating how the sum Phi_1 + Phi_2 is affected by parallel translations. # Conclusion: The sum of the shapes (Phi_1 + Phi_2) remains invariant under parallel translations, demonstrating that the configuration of these shapes is preserved under parallel translations while the origin (O) may move independently within the plane.

But since f(x - x) = f(0) and x - x = 0, it follows that f(0) = f(x) + f(-x). So the value of the function at zero, f(0), must be zero for any x. This gives us f(x) + f(-x) = 0 or f(-x) = -f(x), which is the definition of an odd function. Hence, f(x) is an odd function. (2) To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [-3, 3], we must consider that the function is monotonic. Let x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} with x_1 < x_2. Because for x > 0, f(x) < 0, we have that: f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f(x_2) + f(-x_1) = f(x_2 - x_1) < 0, where x_2 - x_1 > 0. From this, it follows that f(x_2) < f(x_1). Therefore, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing over mathbb{R}. Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing, the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [-3, 3] will be at the left endpoint, f(-3), and the minimum value will be at the right endpoint, f(3). Given f(1) = -2, we have: f(2) = f(1 + 1) = f(1) + f(1) = -2 + (-2) = -4, f(3) = f(2 + 1) = f(2) + f(1) = -4 + (-2) = -6. Because f(x) is an odd function, then f(-3) = -f(3). Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) on [-3, 3] is f(-3) = -f(3) = boxed{6}, and the minimum value is f(3) = boxed{-6}."},{"prompt":"Melanie had 7 dimes in her bank.

Both m and n need to be divisible by 36, implying they are divisible by 4 and 9. For divisibility by 4, the last two digits of both m and n must form a number divisible by 4, and for divisibility by 9, the sum of the digits of both m and n must be a multiple of 9. Since m ends with 6 or 0 (from divisibility by 4), m must start with 6 when reversed. As m is also divisible by 7 and divisibility requirements, it must be divisible by 7 times 36 = 252. Calculating multiples of 252 within the range of four-digit numbers starting and ending with 6, the numbers can be 2520, 2772, 3024, 3276, 3528, 3780, 4032, 4284, 4536, 4788, 5040, 5292, 5544, 5796, 6048.

Let's proceed step by step. 1. **Understand the Functions**: - The sine function, sin x, is periodic with a period of 2pi and oscillates between -1 and 1. - The logarithm function, log_{10} x, is monotonic (strictly increasing) and only defined for x > 0, with log_{10} x rightarrow -infty as x rightarrow 0^+ and log_{10} x rightarrow infty as x rightarrow infty. 2. **Identify the range for solutions**: - For sin x to equal log_{10} x, both functions must have values that overlap. Since sin x is bounded between -1 and 1, log_{10} x must also be within this interval for there to be any roots. - Therefore, we need to find out for what values of x, log_{10} x lies in [-1, 1]. - Solving log_{10} x = -1 and log_{10} x = 1, gives x = 10^{-1} = 0.1 and x = 10^1 = 10 respectively. Therefore, we restrict x to the interval (0.1, 10]. 3. **Determine the critical points**: - The interval (0.1, 10] includes one complete period of the sine function [0, 2pi] and a part of the second period up to approximately frac{5pi}{2} approx 7.85. 4. **Analyze the first period [0, (2pi)]**: - Within the interval [0, 2pi], the sin x function completes one full cycle. This guarantees at least one intersection since log_{10} x is continuous and smoothly varying between -1 and 1 in this interval. 5. **Analyze beyond (2pi) up to 10**: - Beyond 2pi but within 10, we have left[2pi, 2pi + frac{pi}{2} right]. This segment goes until frac{5pi}{2}approx 7.85, which is less than 10. - In left[2pi, 2pi + frac{pi}{2}right], the sine function will start from 0 again and reach its maximum and minimum, thus intersecting log_{10} x at two new points near frac{5pi}{2}, specifically to the left and right side of it. 6. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, there is one intersection in the interval [0, 2pi] and two intersections in the next segment left[2pi, 2pi + frac{pi}{2}right].

We need to prove that we can choose 100 pairwise disjoint chords such that the sums of the pairs of numbers at the endpoints of the chosen chords are equal. 2. **Define Chord Color:** Define a chord to have color (k) (denoted as (c_k)) if the sum of its endpoints is (k). For example, if a chord connects points labeled (a) and (b), then the color of the chord is (a + b). 3. **Chord Properties:** - Each point on the circle can be an endpoint of chords of different colors. - Define the reach (r) of a chord as the number of smaller arcs (of reach 1) that form its minor arc. Each chord intersects at most (r-1) other chords of the same color. 4. **Assigning Values to Chords:** Assign a value of (frac{1}{r}) to every chord, where (r) is the reach of the chord. The value of a color is the sum of the values of all chords of that color. 5. **Total Value Calculation:** Let (N = 2n = 2^{500}).

We need to find an independent set of size at least 100 in this graph. 8. **Greedy Algorithm for Independent Set:** Given a graph (G) with vertices of degree ((d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{|V|})), we can pick an independent set with: [ v(G) = sum_{i=1}^{|V|} frac{1}{d_i+1} ] vertices. This is done by iteratively picking the vertex with the smallest degree and removing it along with its neighbors. 9. **Application to Our Problem:** For the graph (G_c), each chord intersects at most (r-1) other chords. Thus, the value of each chord is at least (frac{1}{r}). Since the total value of color (c) is at least 172.94, we can find an independent set of size at least 100. 10. **Conclusion:** We have shown that there exists a color (c) such that we can pick 100 non-intersecting chords of that color, satisfying the problem's conditions.

Since the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_{n+1} = frac{1}{2}a_n + t and a_1 = frac{1}{2} (where t is a constant and t neq frac{1}{4}), we have: a_{n+1} - 2t = frac{1}{2}a_n + t - 2t = frac{1}{2}(a_n - 2t). Therefore, the ratio of consecutive terms is: frac{a_{n+1} - 2t}{a_n - 2t} = frac{1}{2}.

When t = -frac{1}{8}, the sequence {a_n + frac{1}{4}} is a geometric sequence with the first term frac{3}{4} and common ratio frac{1}{2}: a_n + frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1} = frac{3}{2}left(frac{1}{2}right)^n.

The surface area A of the pool (including the bottom and the walls but not the open top) is A = lw + 2lh + 2wh. Plugging in lw = 4 and h = 4, we get A = 4 + 2(4l) + 2(4w). Now, let's calculate the cost C of the pool. The cost of the bottom is 110 yuan per square meter and the cost of the walls is 90 yuan per square meter. Hence, the cost of the bottom is C_{text{bottom}} = 110lw and the cost of the walls is C_{text{walls}} = 90(2lh + 2wh) = 90(8l + 8w).

The placement of coins in the columns to the left (C_1, ldots, C_{j-1}) and to the right (C_{j+1}, ldots, C_{100}) of the empty column must adhere to specific patterns to ensure no two coins in adjacent cells. 4. **Patterns in Adjacent Columns**: - For any column C_i: - The column must be filled in such a way that no two coins are in adjacent cells. - Examples of valid placements in each column: - First cell occupied, second cell empty. - Second cell occupied, first cell empty. - Given two adjacent columns, there are exactly 2 ways to place coins such that the configuration holds without violating the adjacency constraint. 5. **Calculation for Fixed Empty Column**: - If fixing C_j as the empty column, the arrangements of coins in the columns to the left (C_1, ldots, C_{j-1}) can be chosen in 2 ways, and similarly for the right (C_{j+1}, ldots, C_{100}) in 2 ways. - Therefore, with a fixed empty column, there are 2 times 2 = 4 ways to arrange coins. 6. **Special Cases**: - When the empty column is the first (C_1) or the last (C_{100}) column, there are only 2 possible arrangements (one side has no contributing arrangements). 7. **Total Number of Ways**: - For each of the inner columns C_2 to C_{99} (98 columns), there are 4 ways: [ 98 times 4 = 392 ] - For the first column C_1 and the last column C_{100}, there are each 2 ways: [ 2 + 2 = 4 ] 8. **Summing Up**: - Adding all possible configurations: [ 392 + 4 = 396 ] Therefore, the total number of ways to place the 99 coins is: [ boxed{396} ]"},{"prompt":"w much time will it take for a man to travel some distance across the floor if he is traveling at 2 m/s and it takes him 39 seconds to complete the journey?","completion":"If the man is traveling at a speed of 2 meters per second (m/s) and it takes him 39 seconds to complete the journey, you can calculate the distance he travels by using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time Here, the speed is 2 m/s and the time is 39 seconds.

We know: [ overrightarrow{OG} = frac{overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB} + overrightarrow{OC}}{3} ] 6. Substituting ( overrightarrow{OG} ) back into the equation for ( overrightarrow{OH} ): [ overrightarrow{OH} = 3 left( frac{overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB} + overrightarrow{OC}}{3} right) = overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB} + overrightarrow{OC} ] 7.

Consider its diametrically opposite number on the circle, and analyze the distribution of numbers smaller than k. 3. **Balancing the Numbers:** Once we discard 2m+1 and its opposite number from consideration, among the remaining numbers, all numbers less than 2m+1 must be evenly divided into two groups. Thus, there must be an even number of numbers less than 2m+1. 4. **Counting the Numbers Less Than k:** If k = 83, then the set of numbers less than 83 contains 82 elements.

Similarly, the total “actions” (either ordering soup or not ordering salad) should account for each of the 2015 individuals plus one additional count because of the condition ( S = L + 1 ). 5. We can solve the problem using binomial coefficients and Vandermonde's identity. Specifically, evaluate the sum: [ sum_{i=0}^{2014} binom{2015}{i} binom{2015}{i+1} ] This sum is equivalent to finding the required configurations where soup orders exceed salad orders by exactly 1. 6. We can use Vandermonde's identity, which states: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{r}{i} binom{s}{n-i} = binom{r+s}{n} ] In our case, let ( r ) and ( s ) both be 2015 and ( n ) be 2015, leading to: [ sum_{i=0}^{2014} binom{2015}{i} binom{2015}{2015-1-i} = binom{4030}{2014} = binom{4030}{2016} ] given by noting that ( binom{2015}{i+1} ). 7. Each combination occurs with a probability factor of ( ( frac{1}{2} )^{2015+2015} = ( frac{1}{2} )^{4030} ). 8. Hence the probability solution becomes: [ P(S = L+1) = frac{binom{4030}{2016}}{2^{4030}} ] Thus, simplifying and incorporating everything above, gives us our desired probability. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{binom{4030}{2016}}{2^{4030}}} ]"},{"prompt":"The sequence {a_n} satisfies a_1=3, a_{n+1}=begin{cases} 2a_n,&(0leqslant a_nleqslant 1) a_n1,&(a_n > 1).end{cases} Find a_{2016}=______, and the sum of the first n terms of the sequence S_n= ______.","completion":"According to the given conditions, a_1=3, a_2=a_1-1=2, a_3=a_2-1=1, a_4=2a_3=2, ...

A: Between 4 and 5 B: Between 5 and 6 C: Between 6 and 7 D: Between 7 and 8","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by breaking down the expression and simplifying it step by step: 1. We have the expression (3sqrt{15}+2sqrt{5})×sqrt{frac{1}{5}}. 2. This can be separated into two parts: 3sqrt{15}times sqrt{frac{1}{5}} and 2sqrt{5}times sqrt{frac{1}{5}}. 3. Simplifying each part, we get: - For 3sqrt{15}times sqrt{frac{1}{5}}, we can combine the square roots: 3sqrt{15 times frac{1}{5}} = 3sqrt{3}. - For 2sqrt{5}times sqrt{frac{1}{5}}, similarly, we combine the square roots: 2sqrt{5 times frac{1}{5}} = 2. 4. Adding these results together, we have 3sqrt{3} + 2. Now, to estimate the value of 3sqrt{3}: - We know that sqrt{9} = 3, so sqrt{3} is less than 3. - Since 3^2 = 9 and 2^2 = 4, sqrt{3} is more than sqrt{4} = 2. - Therefore, 3sqrt{3} is more than 3 times 2 = 6 but less than 3 times 3 = 9. Given that 3sqrt{3} > 6 and adding 2 to it, we get that 3sqrt{3} + 2 > 8 is not true. Instead, since 3sqrt{3} < 9, adding 2 gives us 3sqrt{3} + 2 < 11. Correcting the estimation, since 3sqrt{3} is slightly more than 6, adding 2 gives us a value slightly more than 8 but less than 11. However, the correct range to consider based on the options provided and the accurate calculation is: - Since 3sqrt{3} is slightly more than 6, and adding 2 to it, we should find that 3sqrt{3} + 2 is slightly more than 8 but actually, considering the correct estimation process, we find that 3sqrt{3} + 2 is more than 7 but less than 8 because 3sqrt{3} is more than 5 but less than 6. Therefore, the correct estimation is: 7 < 3sqrt{3} + 2 < 8 Hence, the value of (3sqrt{15}+2sqrt{5})×sqrt{frac{1}{5}} should be between 7 and 8.

The relative speed is: Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 52 km/hr - 36 km/hr Relative speed = 16 km/hr To calculate the time, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s because the length of the trains is given in meters.

First, we note that overrightarrow{{A}_{1}{B}_{1}} is perpendicular to any vector that lies on the faces of the cube, including overrightarrow{{A}_{i}{B}_{j}} for any i and j not equal to 1.

Given this, we can express overrightarrow{{A}_{i}{B}_{j}} as the sum of three vectors: overrightarrow{{A}_{i}{A}_{1}}, overrightarrow{{A}_{1}{B}_{1}}, and overrightarrow{{B}_{1}{B}_{j}}. This is because moving from A_i to B_j can be thought of as moving from A_i to A_1, then from A_1 to B_1, and finally from B_1 to B_j.

If conversely it proceeds at half, it would mean at worst: [ a_{n+1} approx frac{a_n}{2} ] 7. **Simplify & Conclude**: [ 1988, frac{1988}{2}, frac{1988}{4}, frac{1988}{8}, frac{1988}{16}, frac{1988}{32}, frac{1988}{64} ] - In general terms: - By the 7th division, (1988) divided logarithmically (or halved per step) would be reduced to : [ frac{1988}{2^6} = frac{1988}{64} approx 31.06. ] 8. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, if the numbers start from values (leq 1988), the process wouldn't need more than 6 divisions before one of the numbers becomes zero, as the number would have been sufficiently reduced.

Otherwise, ( X ) wouldn't be maximum as we could add such a vertex to ( X ). - Therefore, there are at least ( |V setminus X| = 30 - |X| ) edges between ( V setminus X ) and ( X ). 4. **Degree Constraint:** - Each vertex in ( X ) can have at most 5 edges, thus: [ 30 - |X| leq 5|X| ] - Solving for ( |X| ): [ 30 - |X| leq 5|X| implies 30 leq 6|X| implies |X| geq 5 ] 5. **Assessing ( |X| = 5 ):** - If ( |X| = 5 ), there would be ( 30 - 5 = 25 ) edges among vertices in ( X ) and ( V setminus X ). - Each vertex in ( X ) would connect to 5 vertices from ( V setminus X ). 6. **Contradiction of ( |X| = 5 ):** - Assume ( X = {a, b, c, d, e} ). - Consider neighbors of ( a ), denoted as ( Y_a = {y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5} ). - As per condition (ii), at least two vertices in ( Y_a ) are not connected. Let these be ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ). - Thus, ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ) are not neighbors of any other vertices in ( X ), making ( {y_1, y_2, b, c, d, e} ) an independent set larger than 5, which contradicts ( X ) being maximum. - Therefore, ( |X| geq 6 ). 7. **Existence of a Maximum Independent Set:** - Let's construct ( V ) into subsets ( V_1, V_2, V_3 ) each of size 10 with special edge structures: [ |V_1| = |V_2| = |V_3| = 10 ] - Connect vertices within ( V_1 ), ( V_2 ), and ( V_3 ) such that: - Each vertex in a subset has connections forming circular paths, ensuring degrees of 5. - There are no connections between different subsets. - For each subset, the independent set within it could contain at most 2 vertices. - Hence, ( X ), the overall independent set, cannot exceed size 6: [ |X| = |V_1 cap X| + |V_2 cap X| + |V_3 cap X| leq 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 ] 8. **Conclusion:** - Combining lower bound and upper construction: [ 6 leq |X| leq 6 ] - So, the largest ( k ) is: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are both integers.

From the system of equations: begin{cases} y = x - 4 y^{2} = 2mx end{cases} we eliminate y to obtain a quadratic equation in x: x^2 - 2(4 + m)x + 16 = 0 From this equation, we have x_1 + x_2 = 2(4 + m) and x_1 x_2 = 16. We can then find the square of the difference of the x-coordinates of A and B as (x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 16m + 4m^2 Similarly, for the y-coordinates, we have: (y_1 - y_2)^2 = [(x_1 - 4) - (x_2 - 4)]^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 = 16m + 4m^2 Therefore, the length of the chord AB is given by: |AB| = sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} = sqrt{2(16m + 4m^2)} Since it's given that |AB| = 6 sqrt{2}, we can set up an equation: sqrt{2(16m + 4m^2)} = 6 sqrt{2} By squaring both sides and simplifying, we obtain: 2(16m + 4m^2) = 36 Rightarrow 32m + 8m^2 = 36 Rightarrow 8m^2 + 32m - 36 = 0 Divide through by 8 to simplify: m^2 + 4m - 4.5 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation for m yields: m = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 + 4 times 4.5}}{2} m = frac{-4 pm sqrt{34}}{2} Since m corresponds to the coefficient in the parabola's equation, and our parabola is opening either to the right or the left (because it's a horizontal parabola), m should be a real number.

We know from the problem statement that every three consecutive segments are pairwise perpendicular to each other. 2. **Perpendicularity Condition:** Given that each set of three consecutive segments are pairwise perpendicular, we can state: [ boldsymbol{e}_{1} perp boldsymbol{e}_{2}, quad boldsymbol{e}_{2} perp boldsymbol{e}_{3}, quad boldsymbol{e}_{3} perp boldsymbol{e}_{1} ] 3. **Repetition Pattern:** This perpendicularity condition implies that the vector following boldsymbol{e}_{3} must be perpendicular to both boldsymbol{e}_{2} and boldsymbol{e}_{3}, which means it must be either boldsymbol{e}_{1} or -boldsymbol{e}_{1}. Extending this reasoning, the sequence of vectors should cyclically react as: [ boldsymbol{e}_{1}, boldsymbol{e}_{2}, boldsymbol{e}_{3}, pmboldsymbol{e}_{1}, pmboldsymbol{e}_{2}, pmboldsymbol{e}_{3}, ldots ] 4. **Cyclical Nature and Count Divisibility:** Since we are given that the broken line is closed, the sequence of directional vectors needs to return back to the starting point after completing the cycle. Hence, the sequence of vectors repeats every 3 segments. [ boldsymbol{e}_{1}, boldsymbol{e}_{2}, boldsymbol{e}_{3}, boldsymbol{e}_{1}, boldsymbol{e}_{2}, boldsymbol{e}_{3}, ldots ] Therefore, the total number of segments must be a multiple of 3. 5. **Even Distribution Across the Axis:** Furthermore, because the line is closed, the number of segments in each of the pmboldsymbol{e}_{1}, pmboldsymbol{e}_{2}, pmboldsymbol{e}_{3} directions must be equal to ensure that the final and starting point coincide. Hence, the count of each boldsymbol{e}_{i} and boldsymbol{-e}_{i} should be even. - This imposes a condition that the count of direction vectors should also be divisible by 2. 6. **Combining Both Conditions:** Thus, the total number of segments must satisfy both divisibility by 3 and evenness, implying that total ( n ) number of segments must be a multiple of 6 (the least common multiple of 3 and 2).

Let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Define the Set ( S )**: Let ( S ) be the set of rational numbers reachable from ( 0 ) by applying the operations ( x mapsto frac{1}{x} ), ( x mapsto -x ), and ( x mapsto 1 - x ). 2. **Reachability from ( 0 )**: We need to show that all rational numbers can be reached from ( 0 ) using these operations. We start with ( 0 ) and apply the operations iteratively. 3. **Subgroup Analysis**: Consider the subgroup ( langle a rangle subset F ) where ( F ) is the free group generated by the operations. If ( q in S ), then ( q + mathbb{Z} in S ). This implies that if ( 0 in S ), then ( mathbb{Z} in S ), and consequently, ( left{frac{1}{n} mid n in mathbb{Z}^{times}right} in S ). 4. **Euclidean Algorithm and Induction**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to show that all rationals can be reached. We prove this by strong induction on ( M(q) = max(|a|, |b|) ) where ( q = frac{a}{b} ) and ( (a, b) = 1 ). - **Base Case**: When ( q = 0 ), we have reached the base case. - **Inductive Step**: For ( q neq 0 ), one of the sets ( left(q + mathbb{Z}, frac{1}{q} + mathbb{Z}right) ) contains an element with a strictly smaller ( M )-value. Each rational number has a finite ( M )-value and hence a finite number of steps away from ( 0 ). 5. **Coloring Analysis**: We have established that all rationals can be reached from ( 0 ). Now, we need to analyze the parity of the path connecting two arbitrary rationals. - **Parity Preservation**: The operation ( a ) preserves parity when acting on all rationals except for ( 0 ), while ( a^{-1} ) preserves parity when acting on all rationals except for ( 1 ). - **Homomorphism to ( C_2 )**: Consider the homomorphism from ( F ) to ( C_2 ) defined by the generators ( a = 1, b^2 = 1 ). This homomorphism helps us determine the parity of an element of ( F ). 6. **Conclusion**: By considering the parity and the homomorphism, we conclude that there are exactly two valid colorings of the rational numbers. These two colorings correspond to the two possible ways to color ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) differently and extend this coloring to all rationals while maintaining the required conditions.

Brenda, in this time, runs 150 + (x - (x + 50)) = 150 + x - x - 50 = 100 meters. 4. **Set Up Proportion:** Since both Brenda and Sally run at constant speeds, the ratio of the distances they run should be constant. Therefore, set up the proportion: [ frac{150}{x - 150} = frac{100}{200} ] 5. **Cross-Multiply and Solve for x:** Cross-multiplying the proportion: [ 150 times 200 = 100 times (x - 150) ] Simplify: [ 30000 = 100x - 15000 ] Solve for x: [ 100x = 45000 implies x = 450 text{ meters} ] 6. **Conclusion:** The length of the track is 450 meters.
