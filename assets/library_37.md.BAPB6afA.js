En général, sur la bouilloire, vous trouverez une plaque signalétique indiquant la puissance en watts, le voltage (V), et parfois l\'amperage (A). La nouvelle fiche doit être capable de supporter ces valeurs. Par exemple, dans beaucoup de pays européens, la tension standard est de 230V, et les fiches sont généralement évaluées pour 13A ou parfois 10A ou 16A selon le câblage de la maison. 2. **Type de Prise**: Les prises varient selon la région ou le pays. En France et dans beaucoup de pays européens, les prises de type E (avec broche de terre) sont communes, alors qu\'au Royaume-Uni, il s\'agit de prises de type G avec trois broches rectangulaires. Assurez-vous d\'acheter une fiche qui s\'adapte à la prise murale standard de votre région. 3. **Connecteur de Terre**: Si votre bouilloire comporte un fil de terre (généralement de couleur verte et jaune), il est très important que la nouvelle fiche ait aussi un connecteur de terre pour des raisons de sécurité. 4. **Matériaux de Qualité**: Privilégiez une fiche de bonne qualité faite de matériaux durables et résistants à la chaleur. Les fiches avec un boîtier en matière plastique dur et des composants métalliques solides sont préférables. 5. **Fonctionnalités de Sécurité**: Certaines fiches disposent de fonctionnalités supplémentaires comme un fusible intégré pour une protection contre les surtensions, ce qui offre une sécurité additionnelle. 6. **Conformité aux Standards**: Assurez-vous que la fiche est conforme aux normes de sécurité en vigueur dans votre région (par exemple, CE en Europe, UL aux États-Unis). Une fois tous ces points vérifiés, vous pouvez vous rendre dans une quincaillerie, un magasin de bricolage, ou commander une fiche en ligne. Si vous n\'êtes pas sûr des spécifications de votre bouilloire, consulter le manuel d\'utilisateur ou contacter le fabricant peut s\'avérer utile. Prenez en compte que si les dégâts semblent étendus ou si d\'autres aspects de votre bouilloire semblent défectueux, il peut être plus sûr de remplacer l\'ensemble de l\'appareil plutôt que simplement la fiche.

They agreed it was time for a day of good old-fashioned relaxation and, having heard of a tranquil river just beyond the forest’s edge, they set out on their noblest quest yet: to do absolutely nothing. Arriving at the river, they glanced around to ensure they were alone. \\"Dobe, are you sure no one\'s watching?\\" Sasuke asked, his usual brooding tone laced with a hint of mischief. \\"Relax, Teme! We\'ve earned this!\\" Naruto plopped his clothes into a neat pile on the riverbank. They both stood in their birthday suits, liberating themselves from any shinobi attire. Naruto, the hyperactive ninja, was lean but muscular, his body sculpted by years of relentless training and battles, his sun-kissed skin covered with faint scars and his famous seal faintly visible on his toned abdomen. Sasuke, the cool and composed Uchiha, had a physique just as impressive. With a more slender frame highlighting his agility, he carried himself with a silent strength, his pale skin a stark contrast to the dark Curse Mark adorning his shoulder. With carefree spirits, they stepped into the cool, rippling waters of the river. Their muscles relaxed under the gentle flow, and they released contented sighs in unison. \\"This is great,\\" Naruto proclaimed, stretching out his arms and letting the current carry him. \\"We should have done this ages ago!\\" Sasuke, floating nearby, grunted in agreement, his dark eyes closing as tranquility washed over him. And then, it happened. Pffffft. A mischievous smirk crept onto Naruto\'s face as a bubble surfaced next to him. \\"Ha! That felt awesome!\\" The smirk disappeared as Sasuke raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \\"Really, dobe? We came here for peace, and you bring your own brand of noise?\\" However, it wasn\'t long before a smirk of his own betrayed him. Pffrrbbtt. Sasuke\'s discipline faltered, and he let out a laugh. This was, perhaps, the ultimate release of tension. Their faces demonstrated that unique blend of relaxation and slight strain. Naruto\'s whisker-marked cheeks puffed out for a brief moment, while his blue eyes twinkled with mischief. Sasuke\'s usually stoic expression contorted ever so slightly as he tried to maintain his cool façade, but the corners of his mouth turned upwards in a rare, genuine smile. A few unsuspecting fish, which had been swimming peacefully, floated belly-up, overcome by the odoriferous onslaught. \\"Looks like we caught dinner!\\" Naruto exclaimed, his laughter echoing through the trees. They waded towards the now motionless fish and collected them with ease, an unexpected yet welcome turn of events. \\"Only you could turn farting into a fishing technique, Naruto,\\" Sasuke chuckled, shaking his head. Back at the shore, they quickly ignited a fire with a flick of Sasuke\'s fire jutsu and set about grilling their peculiar catch. The aroma of the cooking fish blended with the fresh, forest air, masking the earlier unpleasantness. \\"Ah, the spoils of battle!\\" Naruto beamed, turning a fish over the flames. \\"Spare me your dramatics,\\" Sasuke replied, a half-smile on his face. \\"But I have to admit, this isn\'t a bad way to end the day.\\" As the evening sun dipped low, casting an orange glow over the scene, Naruto and Sasuke enjoyed the fruits of their...unique fishing method. And in that rare moment of camaraderie and simple pleasures, the legendary shinobi were just two friends, savoring their day off at the river."},{"prompt":"what did the fish see as they swam behind Naruto and Sasuke?","completion":"As the fish casually swam behind Naruto and Sasuke, they likely saw the two shinobi from an angle most people never would. Below is a humorous take on what the fish might have \\"witnessed\\": The fish, accustomed to the serene flow of the river, might have initially observed a rather peaceful scene. Two human figures standing in the water, a curious occurrence but not inherently alarming. Naruto and Sasuke\'s toned legs anchored them against the gentle current, the dappled sunlight shimmering off their wet skin. Their perspective from under the water would have turned amusing and otherworldly when suddenly, the calm waters were disturbed. The fish would have seen the human figures above contorting slightly, their muscular definition flexing with the effort of holding back laughter, or perhaps just passing an uninvited wave of gas. With a sudden release of bubbles from the surface, the fish might have dodged or inspected them curiously, wondering if these strange air pockets contained any tasty treats. However, as the scent of the unexpected emissions hit their delicate senses, they would have quickly realized that these humans were not typical visitors to their aquatic home. Their underwater view abruptly transformed into a scene of chaos as the fish found themselves upside-down, succumbing to the overpowering surprise that emerged from these strange creatures. The last thing the fish saw before losing consciousness was the distorted view of Naruto and Sasuke above the waves, possibly both wearing expressions of childish glee at their impromptu underwater \\"technique.\\" And so, the fish had an experience they\'d never forget if they were capable of such memory—witnessing two legendary ninjas in their most relaxed and unconventional moment, a goofy footnote in the epic saga of Naruto and Sasuke."},{"prompt":"Comment sacha a gagné la ligue alola","completion":"Sacha, connu sous le nom d\'Ash Ketchum dans les versions anglophones, remporte la Ligue d\'Alola dans l\'anime Pokémon lors de la série \\"Pokémon, la série : Soleil et Lune\\" (\\"Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon\\" en anglais).

Naruto Uzumaki, whose bright orange jumpsuit stuck to his skin like glue, glanced at his eternal rival and best friend, Sasuke Uchiha, and muttered, \\"I\'m sweating like a Tonton at a barbeque festival.\\" \\"Indeed,\\" Sasuke replied, just as drenched in sweat, his once-cool demeanor now as flustered as his dampened hair. \\"Perhaps a moment of respite is in order.\\" And that\'s how they found themselves by the lazy river that meandered through the forest.

Sasuke, with his own well-toned physique reflecting his Uchiha heritage and intense training habits, nodded with approval as they approached the water. They slid into the river, the cool water enveloping them like a liquid hug. \\"Ahh, this is the life, eh, Sasuke?\\" Naruto sighed contentedly as they floated, eyes closed. \\"Mmm,\\" Sasuke hummed in agreement, the stress lines on his face smoothing out as he relaxed for the first time in what felt like years. And then it happened—a low, bubbling sound escaped from Naruto, a tiny smirk forming on his face. The river seemed to giggle in response. Sasuke raised an eyebrow, but the corners of his mouth turned up ever so slightly as he retaliated with his own aquatic symphony. They opened one eye each to gauge the other\'s reaction. Naruto\'s face was red with effort and amusement, while Sasuke\'s expression had relaxed into an uncharacteristic smile as they both reveled in the childish joy of their actions. Below the surface, however, the fish told a different story. Struck by the pungent odors, they floated up, belly-up, in a silent white-flag surrender to the power of the shinobi gas. The two friends erupted into laughter, the sound echoing off the water and trees. \\"Y\'know, Sasuke, we might\'ve just invented a new fishing technique,\\" Naruto chortled, scooping up an unfortunate fish. \\"Efficient, if a bit unorthodox,\\" Sasuke remarked dryly, plucking his own catch from the water. They waded back to shore, still chuckling, and began to prepare a campfire. \\"You know, if we added this to the scroll of jutsu, we\'d need a solid name,\\" Naruto said, skewering a fish and holding it over the flames. \\"Hmm, \'The Grand Shinobi Flatulence Fish Catching Technique,\' perhaps?\\" Sasuke suggested, an amused glint in his eye. Naruto burst into laughter. \\"That\'s a mouthful, but I like it! Hey, we should write this down before we forget!\\" As the fire crackled and the smell of cooking fish overtook the lingering aroma of their unconventional fishing method, the two friends enjoyed the fruits of their labor and the simplicity of the moment, knowing that days like these were rare and to be cherished. The firelight flickered over their faces, highlighting a rare scene of peace between them. \\"You\'re not half-bad at this relaxation thing, Sasuke,\\" Naruto said with a full mouth, grinning. \\"You\'re not half-bad at catching fish with... unconventional methods,\\" Sasuke replied, a smirk playing on his lips as he took another bite.

She’d always been a healthy, hardworking, vibrant woman who had loved life right up until her last minute on earth. In fact, I saw her the night before she died. We met at an auditorium to watch a high school basketball tournament. She was laughing, talking, and enjoying life like she always did. But just twenty-four hours later she was gone. The loss of my mother affected me deeply. I couldn’t imagine going through the rest of my life without her advice, laughter, or love. At the time, I was working as a therapist at a community mental health center, and I took a few weeks off to privately deal with my grief. I knew I couldn’t be effective at helping other people unless I was able to productively deal with my own feelings. Becoming used to a life that no longer included my mother was a process. It wasn’t easy, but I worked hard to get myself back on my feet. From my training as a therapist, I knew that time doesn’t heal anything; it’s how we deal with that time that determines the speed at which we heal. I understood that grief was the necessary process that would eventually alleviate my pain, so I allowed myself to feel sad, to get angry, and to fully accept what I’d truly lost when my mother passed away. It wasn’t just that I missed her—it was also the painful realization that she would never be there again during the important events in my life and that she would never experience the things she’d looked forward to—like retire from her job and become a grandmother. With supportive friends and family, and my faith in God, I found a sense of peace; and as life went on, I was able to remember my mother with a smile, rather than with pangs of sadness. A few years later, as we approached the third anniversary of my mother’s death, my husband, Lincoln, and I discussed how to best honor her memory that weekend. Friends had invited us to watch a basketball game on Saturday evening. Coincidentally, the game was being played in the same auditorium where we’d last seen my mother. Lincoln and I talked about what it would be like to go back to the place where we’d seen her, just three years ago, on the night before she passed away. We decided it could be a wonderful way to celebrate her life. After all, my memories of her that night were very good. We’d laughed, had a chance to talk about all kinds of things, and had an all-around great evening. My mother had even predicted my sister would get married to her boyfriend at the time—and a few years later that prediction came true. So Lincoln and I returned to the auditorium and we enjoyed spending time with our friends. We knew it was what my mother would have wanted. It felt nice to go back and feel okay about being there. But just as I took a sigh of relief about my progress in dealing with my mother’s death, my entire life was once again turned upside down. After returning home from the basketball game, Lincoln complained of back pain. He’d broken several vertebrae in a car accident a few years prior, so back pain wasn’t unusual for him. But just a few minutes later, he collapsed. I called for paramedics and they arrived within minutes and transported him to the hospital. I called his mother, and his family met me in the emergency room. I had no idea what could possibly be wrong with him. After a few minutes in the emergency room waiting area, we were called into a private room. Before the doctor even said a word, I knew what he was going to say. Lincoln had passed away. He’d had a heart attack. On the same weekend that we honored the three-year anniversary of my mother’s death, I now found myself a widow. It just didn’t make any sense. Lincoln was only twenty-six and he didn’t have any history of heart problems. How could he be here one minute and gone the next? I was still adjusting to life without my mother, and now I’d have to learn how to deal with life without Lincoln. I couldn’t imagine how I would get through this. Dealing with the death of a spouse is such a surreal experience. There were so many choices to be made at a time when I really wasn’t in any shape to decide anything. Within a matter of hours, I had to start making decisions about everything from the funeral arrangements to the wording of the obituary. There wasn’t any time to let the reality of the situation really sink in; it was completely overwhelming. I was fortunate to have many people in my life who supported me. A journey through grief is an individual process, but loving friends and family certainly helped. There were times when it seemed to get a little easier and times when it would get worse. Just when I’d think I was getting better, I’d turn another corner to find overwhelming sadness waiting for me. Grief is an emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting process. There were so many things to feel sad about too. I felt sad for my husband’s family, knowing how much they’d loved Lincoln. I felt sad about all the things Lincoln would never experience. And I was sad about all the things we’d never get to do together, not to mention, how much I missed him. I took as much time off from work as I could. Those months are mostly a blur as I was focused on just putting one foot in front of the other every day. But I couldn’t stay out of work forever. I was down to just one income and had to get back into the office. After a couple of months, my supervisor called and asked about my plans to return to work. My clients had been told I would be out of the office indefinitely while I dealt with a family emergency. They weren’t given any type of time frame about how long I’d be out, since we weren’t really sure what was going to happen. But now, they needed an answer. I certainly wasn’t done grieving, and I definitely wasn’t “better,” but I needed to go back to work. Just like when I’d lost my mother, I had to allow myself time to experience the sorrow head-on. There was no ignoring it or pushing it away. I had to experience the pain while also proactively helping myself heal. I couldn’t allow myself to stay stuck in my negative emotions. Although it would have been easy to pity myself or dwell on my past memories, I knew it wouldn’t be healthy. I had to make a conscious choice to start down a long road to building a new life for myself. I had to decide whether some of the goals Lincoln and I shared together were still going to be my goals. We’d been foster parents for a few years and had planned to eventually adopt a child. But did I still want to adopt a child as a single woman? I continued my work as a foster parent, providing mostly emergency and respite placements, for the next few years, but I wasn’t sure I still wanted to adopt a child without Lincoln. I also had to create new goals for myself now that I was alone. I decided to venture out and try new things. I got my motorcycle license and bought a motorcycle. I also began writing. At first it was mostly a hobby, but eventually it turned into a part-time job. I had to renegotiate new relationships with people as well by figuring out which of Lincoln’s friends would remain my friends and what my relationship with his family would be like without him. Fortunately for me, many of his closest friends maintained friendships with me. And his family continued to treat me like part of their family. About four years later, I was fortunate enough to find love again. Or maybe I should say love found me. I was sort of getting used to life as a single person. But that all changed when I began dating Steve. We’d known each other for years and slowly our friendship turned into a relationship. Eventually, we started talking about a future together. Although I had never thought I’d get married again, with Steve it just seemed right. I didn’t want a formal wedding or a reception that parodied the ceremony I’d had with Lincoln. Although I knew my guests would be thrilled to see me marry again, I also knew it would conjure up pangs of sadness for people as they remembered Lincoln. I didn’t want my wedding day to be a somber occasion, so Steve and I decided to have a nontraditional wedding. We eloped to Las Vegas and it was a completely joyous occasion that centered around our love and happiness. About a year after we married, we decided to sell the house that Lincoln and I had lived in, and we moved a few hours away. We’d be closer to my sister and my nieces and it gave us an opportunity to have a fresh start. I got a job at a busy medical practice and we were looking forward to enjoying our future together. Just as life seemed to be going great, our road to happiness took another strange twist when Steve’s father was diagnosed with cancer. Initially, doctors predicted that his treatment could help keep the cancer at bay for several years. But after a few months, it was clear that he wasn’t likely to survive one year, let alone several. He’d tried a few different options but nothing really worked. As time went on the doctors grew more perplexed by his lack of response to treatment. After about seven months, he’d run out of treatment options. The news hit me like a ton of bricks. Rob was so full of life. He was the kind of guy who could always pull a quarter from behind a kid’s ear and he told some of the funniest stories I have ever heard. Although he lived in Minnesota and we lived in Maine, we saw him often. Since he was retired, he had the availability to visit with us for weeks at a time and I’d always joked with him that he was my favorite houseguest—because he was basically our only houseguest. He was also one of my biggest fans when it came to my writing. He read whatever I wrote, whether it was an article about parenting or a piece on psychology. Quite often, he’d call me with story ideas and suggestions. Even though Rob was seventy-two, it felt like he was too young to be so sick. Right up until the previous summer he was motorcycling across the country, sailing around Lake Superior, and cruising the countryside with the top down in his convertible. But now he was too sick, and the doctors were clear—he was only going to get worse. This time I had a different experience dealing with death. My mother’s and Lincoln’s deaths were completely unexpected and sudden. But this time, I had warning. I knew what was coming, and it filled me with a sense of dread. I found myself thinking, Here we go again. I didn’t want to go through such a staggering loss all over again. It just didn’t seem right. I know plenty of people my age who haven’t lost anyone, so why did I have to lose so many of my loved ones? I sat at the table thinking about how unfair it was, how hard it was going to be, and how much I wanted things to be different. I also knew I couldn’t let myself go down that road. After all, I’d been through this before and I’d be okay again. If I let myself fall into the trap of thinking my situation was worse than anyone else’s, or if I convinced myself that I couldn’t handle one more loss, it wasn’t going to help. Instead, it would only hold me back from dealing with the reality of my situation. It was at that moment that I sat down and wrote my list “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do.” They were the habits I’d fought so hard against to come out on the other side of my grief. They were the things that could hold me back from getting better, if I allowed them to take hold of me. Not surprisingly, they were the same skills I was giving to the clients who entered my therapy office. But writing them down was something I needed to do to help me stay on track. It was a reminder that I could choose to be mentally strong. And I needed to be strong, because a few weeks after writing down that list, Rob passed away. Psychotherapists are known for helping others build on their strengths, doling out tips on how they should act and what they can do to improve themselves. But when I created my list on mental strength, I decided to stray for a moment from what has become second nature to me. And focusing on what not to do has made all the difference. Good habits are important, but it’s often our bad habits that prevent us from reaching our full potential. You can have all the good habits in the world, but if you keep doing the bad habits alongside the good ones, you’ll struggle to reach your goals. Think of it this way: you’re only as good as your worst habits. Bad habits are like heavy weights that you drag around as you go about your day. They’ll slow you down, tire you out, and frustrate you. Despite your hard work and talent, you’ll struggle to reach your full potential when you’ve got certain thoughts, behaviors, and feelings holding you back. Picture a man who chooses to go to the gym every day. He works out for almost two hours. He keeps a careful record of the exercises he performs so he can track his progress. Over the course of six months, he isn’t noticing much of a change. He feels frustrated that he’s not losing weight and gaining muscle. He tells his friends and family that it just doesn’t make sense why he’s not looking and feeling better. After all, he rarely ever misses a workout. What he leaves out of the equation is the fact that he enjoys a treat on his drive home from the gym every day. After all that exercise, he feels hungry and tells himself, “I’ve worked hard. I deserve a treat!” So each day, he eats one dozen donuts on his drive home. Seems ridiculous, right? But we all are guilty of this kind of behavior. We work hard to do the things that we think will make us better, but we forget to focus on the things that might be sabotaging our efforts. Avoiding these thirteen habits isn’t just what will help you through grief. Getting rid of them will help you develop mental strength, which is essential to dealing with all life’s problems—big or small. No matter what your goals are, you’ll be better equipped to reach your full potential when you’re feeling mentally strong. OceanofPDF.com WHAT IS MENTAL STRENGTH? It’s not that people are either mentally strong or mentally weak. We all possess some degree of mental strength, but there’s always room for improvement. Developing mental strength is about improving your ability to regulate your emotions, manage your thoughts, and behave in a positive manner, despite your circumstances. Just as there are those among us who are predisposed to develop physical strength more easily than others, mental strength seems to come more naturally to some people. There are several factors at play to determine the ease at which you develop mental strength: • Genetics—Genes play a role in whether or not you may be more prone to mental health issues, such as mood disorders. • Personality—Some people have personality traits that help them think more realistically and behave more positively by nature. • Experiences—Your life experiences influence how you think about yourself, other people, and the world in general. Obviously, you can’t change some of these factors. You can’t erase a bad childhood. You can’t help it if you are genetically predisposed to ADHD. But that doesn’t mean you can’t increase your mental strength. Anyone has the power to increase mental strength by devoting time and energy on the self-improvement exercises throughout this book. THE BASIS OF MENTAL STRENGTH Imagine a man who feels nervous about social situations. To minimize his anxiety, he avoids starting conversations with his coworkers. The less he speaks with his coworkers, the less they initiate conversation with him. When he enters the break room and passes people in the hallway without anyone speaking to him, he thinks, I must be socially awkward. The more he thinks about how awkward he is, the more nervous he feels about starting conversations. As his anxiety increases, his desire to avoid his coworkers also increases. This results in a self-perpetuating cycle. To understand mental strength, you have to learn how your thoughts, behaviors, and feelings are all intertwined, often working together to create a dangerous downward spiral as in the preceding example. This is why developing mental strength requires a three-pronged approach: 1. Thoughts—Identifying irrational thoughts and replacing them with more realistic thoughts. 2. Behaviors—Behaving in a positive manner despite the circumstances. 3. Emotions—Controlling your emotions so your emotions don’t control you. We hear it all the time: “Think positive.” But optimism alone isn’t enough to help you reach your full potential. CHOOSE BEHAVIOR BASED ON BALANCED EMOTIONS AND RATIONAL THINKING I’m terrified of snakes. Yet my fear is completely irrational. I live in Maine. We don’t have a single poisonous snake in the wild. I don’t see snakes very often, but when I do, my heart leaps into my throat and I’m tempted to run as fast as I can in the other direction. Usually, before I run away, I’m able to balance my sheer panic with rational thoughts that remind me that there’s no logical reason to feel afraid. Once my rational thinking kicks in, I can walk by the snake—as long as he’s a safe distance away. I still don’t want to pick him up or pet him, but I can continue past him without letting my irrational fear interfere with my day. We make our best decisions in life when we balance our emotions with rational thinking. Stop and think for a minute about how you behave when you’re really angry. It’s likely that you’ve said and done some things that you regretted later, because you were basing your actions on your emotions, not logic. But making choices based on rational thinking alone also doesn’t make for good decisions. We are human beings, not robots. Our hearts and our heads need to work together to control our bodies. Many of my clients question their ability to control their thoughts, emotions, and behavior. “I can’t help the way I feel,” they say. Or “I can’t get rid of the negative thoughts that run through my head,” and “I just can’t get motivated to do what I want to accomplish.” But with increased mental strength, it’s possible. THE TRUTH ABOUT MENTAL STRENGTH There’s a lot of misinformation and misconception about what it means to be mentally strong. Here are some of the truths about mental strength: • Being mentally strong isn’t about acting tough. You don’t have to become a robot or appear to have a tough exterior when you’re mentally strong. Instead, it’s about acting according to your values. • Mental strength doesn’t require you to ignore your emotions. Increasing your mental strength isn’t about suppressing your emotions; instead it’s about developing a keen awareness of them. It’s about interpreting and understanding how your emotions influence your thoughts and behavior. • You don’t have to treat your body like a machine to be mentally strong. Mental strength isn’t about pushing your body to its physical limits just to prove you can ignore pain. It’s about understanding your thoughts and feelings well enough that you can determine when to behave contrary to them, and when to listen to them. • Being mentally strong doesn’t mean you have to be completely self-reliant. Mental strength isn’t about proclaiming that you don’t ever need help from anyone or any type of higher power. Admitting you don’t have all the answers, asking for help when you need it, and acknowledging that you can gain strength from a higher power is a sign of a desire to grow stronger. • Being mentally strong is not about positive thinking. Thinking overly positive thoughts can be just as detrimental as thinking overly negative thoughts. Mental strength is about thinking realistically and rationally. • Developing mental strength isn’t about chasing happiness. Being mentally strong will help you to be more content in life, but it isn’t about waking up every day and trying to force yourself to feel happy. Instead, it’s about making the decisions that will help you reach your full potential. • Mental strength isn’t just the latest pop psychology trend. Just like the physical fitness world is filled with fad diets and fitness trends, the world of psychology is often filled with fleeting ideas about how to become your best self. Mental strength isn’t a trend. The psychology field has been helping people learn how to change their thoughts, feelings, and behavior since the 1960s. • Mental strength isn’t synonymous with mental health. While the healthcare industry often talks in terms of mental health versus mental illness, mental strength is different. Just like people can still be physically strong even if they have a physical health ailment like diabetes, you can still be mentally strong even if you have depression, anxiety, or other mental health problems. Having a mental illness doesn’t mean you’re destined to have bad habits. Instead, you can still choose to develop healthy habits. It may require more work, more focus, and more effort, but it’s very possible. THE BENEFITS OF MENTAL STRENGTH It’s often easy to feel mentally strong when life is going well, but at times problems arise. A job loss, a natural disaster, an illness in the family, or a death of a loved one is sometimes inevitable. When you’re mentally strong, you’ll be more prepared to deal with life’s challenges. Benefits of increasing your mental strength include: • Increased resilience to stress—Mental strength is helpful in everyday life, not just in the midst of a crisis. You’ll become better equipped to handle problems more efficiently and effectively, and it can reduce your overall stress level. • Improved life satisfaction—As your mental strength increases, your confidence will also increase. You’ll behave according to your values, which will give you peace of mind, and you’ll recognize what’s really important in your life. • Enhanced performance—Whether your goal is to be a better parent, to increase your productivity at the office, or to perform better on the athletic field, increasing your mental strength will help you reach your full potential. HOW TO DEVELOP MENTAL STRENGTH You’ll never become an expert at anything by simply reading a book. Athletes don’t become elite competitors after reading about their sport nor do top musicians increase their musical abilities by simply watching other performers play. They also have to practice. The following thirteen chapters aren’t meant to be a checklist that you either do or don’t do. They are a description of habits that everyone falls prey to sometimes. It’s meant to help you find better ways to cope with life’s challenges so you can avoid these pitfalls. It’s about growing, improving, and striving to become a little better than you were yesterday. OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 1 THEY DON’T WASTE TIME FEELING SORRY FOR THEMSELVES Self-pity is easily the most destructive of the non-pharmaceutical narcotics; it is addictive, gives momentary pleasure and separates the victim from reality. —JOHN GARDNER During the weeks that followed Jack’s accident, his mother couldn’t stop talking about the “horrible incident.” Every day she recounted the story about how both of Jack’s legs were broken when he was hit by a school bus. She felt guilty that she wasn’t there to protect him, and seeing him in a wheelchair for several weeks was almost more than she could bear. Although doctors had predicted a complete recovery, she repeatedly warned Jack that his legs may never fully heal. She wanted him to be aware that he may not be able to play soccer or run around like the other kids ever again, just in case there was a problem. Although his doctors had medically cleared him to return to school, his parents decided that Jack’s mother would quit her job and homeschool him for the remainder of the year. They felt that seeing and hearing school buses each day might trigger too many bad memories. They also wanted to spare him from having to watch idly from his wheelchair as his friends played at recess. They hoped that staying home would help Jack heal faster, both emotionally and physically. Jack usually completed his homeschool work in the mornings and he spent his afternoons and evenings watching TV and playing video games. Within a few weeks, his parents noticed that his mood seemed to change. A normally upbeat and happy child, Jack became irritable and sad. His parents grew concerned that the accident may have traumatized him even more than they’d imagined. They pursued therapy in hopes it could help Jack deal with his emotional scars. Jack’s parents took him to a well-known therapist with expertise in childhood trauma. The therapist had received the referral from Jack’s pediatrician, so she knew a little bit about Jack’s experience prior to meeting him. When Jack’s mother wheeled him into the therapist’s office, Jack stared silently at the floor. His mother began by saying, “We’re having such a hard time since this terrible accident. It’s really ruined our lives and caused a lot of emotional problems for Jack. He’s just not the same little boy.” To his mother’s surprise, the therapist didn’t respond with sympathy. Instead she enthusiastically said, “Boy, have I been looking forward to meeting you, Jack! I’ve never met a kid who could beat a school bus! You have to tell me, how did you manage to get into a fight with a school bus and win?” For the first time since the accident Jack smiled. Over the next few weeks, Jack worked with his therapist on making his own book. He appropriately named it, How to Beat a School Bus. He created a wonderful story about how he managed to fight a school bus and escape with only a few broken bones. He embellished on the story by describing how he grabbed hold of the muffler, swung himself around, and protected the majority of his body from getting hit by the bus. Despite the exaggerated details, the main part of the story remained the same—he survived because he’s a tough kid. Jack concluded his book with a self-portrait. He drew himself sitting in a wheelchair wearing a superhero cape. The therapist included Jack’s parents in the treatment. She helped them see how fortunate they were that Jack survived with only a few broken bones. She encouraged his parents to stop feeling sorry for Jack. She recommended they treat him like a mentally and physically tough kid who was capable of overcoming great adversity. Even if his legs didn’t heal properly, she wanted them to focus on what Jack could still accomplish in life, not what the accident would prevent him from being able to do. The therapist and Jack’s parents worked with the school faculty and staff to prepare for Jack’s return to school. In addition to the special accommodations he’d need because he was still in a wheelchair, they wanted to ensure that the other students and teachers didn’t pity Jack. They arranged for Jack to share his book with his classmates so that he could tell them how he beat the school bus and show them that there was no reason to feel sorry for him. SELF-PITY PARTY We all experience pain and sorrow in life. And although sadness is a normal, healthy emotion, dwelling on your sorrow and misfortune is self-destructive. Do you respond positively to any of the points below? You tend to think your problems are worse than anyone else’s. If it weren’t for bad luck, you’re pretty sure you’d have none at all. Problems seem to add up for you at a much faster rate than anyone else. You’re fairly certain that no one else truly understands how hard your life really is. You sometimes choose to withdraw from leisure activities and social engagements so you can stay home and think about your problems. You’re more likely to tell people what went wrong during your day rather than what went well. You often complain about things not being fair. You struggle to find anything to be grateful for sometimes. You think that other people are blessed with easier lives. You sometimes wonder if the world is out to get you. Can you see yourself in some of the examples above? Self-pity can consume you until it eventually changes your thoughts and behaviors. But you can choose to take control. Even when you can’t alter your circumstances, you can alter your attitude. WHY WE FEEL SORRY FOR OURSELVES If self-pity is so destructive, why do we do it in the first place? And why is it sometimes so easy and even comforting to indulge in a pity party? Pity was Jack’s parents’ defense mechanism to protect their son and themselves from future dangers. They chose to remain focused on what he couldn’t do as a way to shield him from having to face any more potential problems. Understandably, they worried about his safety more than ever. They didn’t want him to be out of their sight. And they were concerned about the emotional reaction he might have to seeing a school bus again. It was only a matter of time before the pity poured on Jack turned into his own self-pity. It’s so easy to fall into the self-pity trap. As long as you feel sorry for yourself, you can delay any circumstances that will bring you face-to-face with your real fears, and you can avoid taking any responsibility for your actions. Feeling sorry for yourself can buy time. Instead of taking action or moving forward, exaggerating how bad your situation is justifies why you shouldn’t do anything to improve it. People often use self-pity as a way to gain attention. Playing the “poor me” card may result in some kind and gentle words from others—at least initially. For people who fear rejection, self-pity can be an indirect way of gaining help by sharing a woe-is-me tale in hopes it will attract some assistance. Unfortunately, misery loves company, and sometimes self-pity becomes a bragging right. A conversation can turn into a contest, with the person who has experienced the most trauma earning the badge of victory. Self-pity can also provide a reason to avoid responsibility. Telling your boss how bad your life is may stem from hopes that less will be expected from you. Sometimes self-pity becomes an act of defiance. It’s almost as if we assume that something will change if we dig in our heels and remind the universe that we deserve better. But that’s not how the world works. There isn’t a higher being—or a human being for that matter—who will swoop in and make sure we’re all dealt a fair hand in life. THE PROBLEM WITH FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF Feeling sorry for yourself is self-destructive. It leads to new problems and can have serious consequences. Instead of feeling grateful that Jack survived the accident, his parents worried about what the accident took away from them. As a result, they allowed the accident to take away even more. That’s not to say they weren’t loving parents. Their behavior stemmed from a desire to keep their son safe. However, the more they pitied Jack, the more negatively it affected his mood. Indulging in self-pity hinders living a full life in the following ways: • It’s a waste of time. Feeling sorry for yourself requires a lot of mental energy and does nothing to change the situation. Even when you can’t fix the problem, you can make choices to cope with life’s obstacles in a positive way. Feeling sorry for yourself won’t move you any closer to a solution. • It leads to more negative emotions. Once you allow it to take hold, self-pity will ignite a flurry of other negative emotions. It can lead to anger, resentment, loneliness, and other feelings that fuel more negative thoughts. • It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Feelings of self-pity can lead to living a pitiful life. When you feel sorry for yourself, it’s unlikely you’ll perform at your best. As a result, you may experience more problems and increased failures, which will breed more feelings of self-pity. • It prevents you from dealing with other emotions. Self-pity gets in the way of dealing with grief, sadness, anger, and other emotions. It can stall your progress from healing and moving forward because self-pity keeps the focus on why things should be different rather than accepting the situation for what it is. • It causes you to overlook the good in your life. If five good things and one bad thing happen in a day, self-pity will cause you to focus only on the negative. When you feel sorry for yourself, you’ll miss out on the positive aspects of life. • It interferes with relationships. A victim mentality is not an attractive characteristic. Complaining about how bad your life is will likely wear on people rather quickly. No one ever says, “What I really like about her is the fact that she always feels sorry for herself.” STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF Remember the three-pronged approach to achieving mental strength? To alleviate feelings of self-pity, you need to change your pitiful behavior and forbid yourself from indulging in pitiful thoughts. For Jack, this meant that he couldn’t spend all his time at home playing video games and watching TV. He needed to be around other kids his age and return to some of his previous activities that he was still able to do, like go to school. His parents also changed their thinking and began to view Jack as a survivor rather than a victim. Once they changed their thoughts about their son and the accident, they were able to exchange self-pity with gratitude. BEHAVE IN A MANNER THAT MAKES IT HARD TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF Four months after Lincoln died, his family and I were facing what should have been his twenty-seventh birthday. I had been dreading that day for weeks because I had no idea how we’d pass the time. My cartoon bubble pictured us sitting around in a circle sharing a box of Kleenex and talking about how unfair it was that he never reached his twenty-seventh birthday. When I finally worked up the courage to ask my mother-in-law how she planned to spend the day, without missing a beat she said, “What do you think about skydiving?” The best part was, she was serious. And, I had to admit, jumping out of a perfectly good airplane did seem like a much better idea than the pity party I’d imagined. It felt like the perfect way to honor Lincoln’s adventurous spirit. He’d always enjoyed meeting new people, going new places, and experiencing new things. It wasn’t unusual for him to head off on a spontaneous weekend trip, even if it meant he’d be flying the red-eye home and would have to go to work as soon as he stepped off the overnight flight. He’d say that one day of feeling tired at work was well worth the memories we’d created. Skydiving was something Lincoln would have loved to do so it seemed like an appropriate way to celebrate his life. It’s impossible to feel sorry for yourself when you’re jumping out of an airplane—unless of course, you don’t have a parachute. Not only did we have a great time, but our skydiving experience led to an annual tradition. Every year on Lincoln’s birthday, we choose to celebrate his love of life and adventure. It’s led to some interesting experiences—from swimming with sharks to riding mules into the Grand Canyon. We’ve even taken flying trapeze lessons. Each year, the whole family becomes involved in Lincoln’s birthday adventure. Some years, Lincoln’s grandmother watches from the sidelines with her camera, but two years ago, at the age of eighty-eight, she was first in line to go ziplining high above the trees. Even though I’m remarried, it’s a tradition we’ve continued, and my husband, Steve, even participates with us. It’s become a day we actually look forward to each year. Our choice to spend the day doing something enjoyable isn’t about ignoring our grief or masking our sadness. It’s about making a conscious choice to celebrate life’s gifts and refusing to behave in a pitiful manner. Instead of pitying ourselves for what we lost, we choose to feel grateful for what we had. When you notice self-pity creeping into your life, make a conscious effort to do something contrary to how you feel. You don’t have to jump out of a plane to ward off feelings of self-pity. Sometimes, small behavioral changes can make a big difference. Here are some examples: • Volunteer to help a worthy cause. It will take your mind off your problems and you can feel good that you’ve helped support someone else. It’s hard to feel sorry for yourself when you’re serving hungry people in a soup kitchen or spending time with elderly residents in a nursing home. • Perform a random act of kindness. Whether you mow the neighbor’s lawn or donate pet food to a local animal shelter, doing a good deed can help bring more meaning to your day. • Do something active. Physical or mental activity will help you focus on something other than your misfortune. Exercise, sign up for a class, read a book, or learn a new hobby, and your behavior change can help shift your attitude. The key to changing your feelings is finding which behaviors will extinguish your feelings of self-pity. Sometimes it’s a process of trial and error because the same behavioral change won’t work for everyone. If what you’re doing now isn’t working, try something new. If you never take a step in the right direction, you’ll stay right where you are. REPLACE THOUGHTS THAT ENCOURAGE SELF-PITY I once witnessed a fender bender in a grocery store parking lot. Two cars were backing up at the same time and their rear bumpers collided. The collision appeared to cause only minor damage to each vehicle. I watched as one driver jumped out of his vehicle and said, “Just what I needed. Why do these things always happen to me? As if I didn’t already have enough to deal with today!” Meanwhile, the other driver stepped out of his vehicle shaking his head. In a very calm voice he said, “Wow, we’re so lucky that no one got hurt. What a great day it is when you can get into an accident and walk away from it without a single injury.” Both men experienced the exact same event. However, their perception of the event was completely different. One man viewed himself as a victim of horrible circumstance while the other man viewed the event as good fortune. Their reaction was all about their differences in perception. You can view the events that happen in your life in many different ways. If you choose to view circumstances in a way that says, “I deserve better,” you’ll feel self-pity often. If you choose to look for the silver lining, even in a bad situation, you’ll experience joy and happiness much more often. Almost every situation has a silver lining. Ask any kid what the best part about having divorced parents is and most of them will say, “I get more presents at Christmas!” Obviously, there isn’t much good that arises from divorce, but getting twice as many presents is one small aspect of divorce that some kids rather enjoy. Reframing the way you look at a situation isn’t always easy, especially when you’re feeling like the host of your own pity party. Asking yourself the following questions can help change your negative thoughts into more realistic thoughts: • What’s another way I could view my situation? This is where the “glass half empty or glass half full” thinking comes in. If you’re looking at it from the glass-half-empty angle, take a moment to think about how someone looking from a glass-half-full perspective might view the same situation. • What advice would I give to a loved one who had this problem? Often, we’re better at handing out words of encouragement to other people rather than to ourselves. It’s unlikely you’d say to someone else, “You’ve got the worst life ever. Nothing ever goes right.” Instead, you’d hopefully offer some kind words of assistance such as, “You’ll figure out what to do, and you’ll make it through this. I know you will.” Take your own words of wisdom and apply them to your situation. • What evidence do I have that I can get through this? Feeling sorry for ourselves often stems from a lack of confidence in our ability to handle problems. We tend to think that we’ll never get through something. Remind yourself of times when you’ve solved problems and coped with tragedy in the past. Reviewing your skills, support systems, and past experiences can give you an extra boost of confidence that will help you stop feeling sorry for yourself. The more you indulge in thoughts that willfully delude yourself about your situation, the worse you’ll feel. Common thoughts that lead to feelings of self-pity include things such as: • I can’t handle one more problem. • Good things always happen to everyone else. • Bad things always happen to me. • My life just gets worse all the time. • No one else has to deal with this stuff. • I just can’t catch a break. You can choose to catch your negative thoughts before they spiral out of control. Though replacing overly negative thoughts with more realistic ones takes practice and hard work, it’s very effective in decreasing feelings of self-pity. If you think, Bad things always happen to me, create a list of good things that have happened to you as well. Then, replace your original thought with something more realistic like, Some bad things happen to me, but plenty of good things happen to me as well. This doesn’t mean you should turn something negative into an unrealistically positive affirmation. Instead, strive to find a realistic way to look at your situation. EXCHANGE SELF-PITY FOR GRATITUDE Marla Runyan is a very accomplished woman. She has a master’s degree, she’s written a book, and she’s competed in the Olympics. She even became the first American woman to finish the 2002 New York Marathon with an astounding time of 2 hours, 27 minutes. What makes Marla particularly extraordinary is that she’s accomplished all these feats despite the fact that she’s legally blind. At age nine, Marla was diagnosed with Stargardt’s disease, a form of macular degeneration that affects children. As her vision deteriorated, Marla discovered her love for running. Over the years, Marla has proved herself to be one of the fastest runners in the world, even though she’s never actually been able to see the finish line. Initially, Marla became an accomplished athlete in the Paralympics. She competed in 1992 and then again in 1996. Not only did she earn a total of five gold medals and one silver medal, she also set several world records. But Marla didn’t stop there. In 1999, she entered the Pan American Games and she won the 1,500-meter race. In 2000, she became the first legally blind athlete to ever compete in the Olympics. She was the first American to cross the finish line in the 1,500-meter race and she placed eighth overall. Marla doesn’t see her blindness as a disability. In fact, she chooses to view it as a gift that allows her to become successful in both long- and short-distance races. In discussing her blindness in her book, No Finish Line: My Life as I See It, Marla writes, “It not only has forced me to prove my competence but also pushed me to achieve. It has given me gifts, such as will and commitment that I use every day.” Marla doesn’t focus on what her vision loss took from her. Instead, she chooses to feel grateful for what her vision impairment actually gave her. While feeling sorry for yourself is about thinking I deserve better, gratitude is about thinking I have more than I deserve. Experiencing gratitude requires some extra effort, but it isn’t hard. Anyone can learn to become more grateful by developing new habits. Start to acknowledge other people’s kindness and generosity. Affirm the good in the world and you will begin to appreciate what you have. You don’t have to be rich, wildly successful, or have the perfect life to feel grateful. A person who earns 34,000 a year may think he doesn’t have much money but he is actually among the richest 1 percent of people in the world. If you’re reading this book, it means you’re more fortunate than the nearly one billion people in the world who can’t read, many of whom will be stuck in a life of poverty. Look for those little things in life that you can so easily take for granted and work toward increasing your feelings of gratitude. Here are a few simple habits that can help you focus on what you have to be grateful for: • Keep a gratitude journal. Each day write down at least one thing you’re grateful for. It could include being grateful for simple pleasures, like having clean air to breathe or seeing the sun shine, or major blessings like your job or family. • Say what you’re grateful for. If you aren’t likely to keep up with writing in a journal, make it a habit to say what you’re grateful for. Find one of life’s gifts to be grateful for each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep. Say the words out loud, even if it’s just to yourself, because hearing the words of gratitude will increase your feelings of gratitude. • Change the channel when you’re experiencing self-pity. When you notice that you’re starting to feel sorry for yourself, shift your focus. Don’t allow yourself to continue thinking that life isn’t fair or that life should be different. Instead, sit down and list the people, circumstances, and experiences in life that you can be thankful for. If you keep a journal, refer to it and read it whenever self-pity begins to set in. • Ask others what they’re grateful for. Strike up conversations about gratitude to help you discover what other people feel thankful for. Hearing what others feel grateful for can remind you of more areas of your life that deserve gratitude. • Teach kids to be grateful. If you’re a parent, teaching your children to be grateful for what they have is one of the best ways to keep your own attitude in check. Make it a habit each day to ask your children what they’re grateful for. Have everyone in the family write down what they’re feeling grateful for and place it in a gratitude jar or hang it on a bulletin board. This will give your family a fun reminder to incorporate gratitude into your daily lives. GIVING UP SELF-PITY WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER Jeremiah Denton served as a U.S. naval aviator during the Vietnam War. In 1965, his plane was shot down and he was forced to eject from his aircraft. He was captured by the North Vietnamese and was taken as a prisoner of war. Commander Denton and the other officers maintained command over their fellow prisoners even as they were beaten, starved, and tortured on a daily basis. Commander Denton was often placed in solitary confinement for urging other prisoners to resist the North Vietnamese attempts to gain information from them. But that didn’t stop Commander Denton. He devised strategies to communicate with the other prisoners by using signs, tapping on walls, and coughing in sequence. Ten months after his capture, he was chosen to participate in a televised interview that was used as propaganda. While answering questions, he pretended as though the bright lights from the cameras were bothering his eyes as he began blinking T-O-R-T-U-R-E in Morse code to secretly send the message that he and his fellow prisoners were being mistreated by their captors. Throughout the interview, he continued to express his support for the U.S. government. He was released in 1973 after seven years in captivity. When he stepped off the plane as a free man, he said, “We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances. We are profoundly grateful to our commander in chief and to our nation for this day. God bless America.” After retiring from the military in 1977, he was elected to serve as senator for Alabama. Despite being placed in the worst circumstances imaginable, Jeremiah Denton didn’t waste time feeling sorry for himself. Instead, he maintained his composure and focused on doing whatever he could to manage the situation. Even when he was released, he chose to feel grateful that he was able to serve his country, rather than pity himself for the time he’d lost. Researchers studied the differences that occur when people focus on their burdens versus focusing on what they’re grateful for. Simply acknowledging a few things you feel grateful for each day is a powerful way to create change. In fact, gratitude not only impacts your psychological health, it can also affect your physical health. A 2003 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found: • People who feel gratitude don’t get sick as often as others. They have better immune systems and report fewer aches and pains. They have lower blood pressure and they exercise more often than the general population. They take better care of their health, sleep longer, and even report feeling more refreshed upon waking. • Gratitude leads to more positive emotions. People who feel grateful experience more happiness, joy, and pleasure on a daily basis. They even feel more awake and energetic. • Gratitude improves social lives. Grateful people are more willing to forgive others. They behave in a more outgoing fashion and feel less lonely and isolated. They are also more likely to help other people and to behave in a generous and compassionate manner. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS If you allow self-pity to take hold when you’re dealing with stress, you’ll put off working on a solution. Watch out for red flags that you’re allowing yourself to feel self-pity and take a proactive approach to change your attitude at the first sign of feeling sorry for yourself. WHAT’S HELPFUL Giving yourself a reality check so you don’t exaggerate how bad the situation really is Replacing overly negative thoughts about your situation with more realistic thoughts Choosing to actively problem-solve and work on improving your situation Getting active and behaving in a way that makes you less likely to feel sorry for yourself, even when you don’t feel like it Practicing gratitude every day WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Allowing yourself to believe that your life is worse than most other people’s lives Indulging in exaggeratedly negative thoughts about how difficult your life is Remaining passive about the situation and focusing only on how you feel, rather than what you can do Declining to participate in experiences and activities that could help you feel better Staying focused on what you don’t have rather than what you do have OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 2 THEY DON’T GIVE AWAY THEIR POWER When we hate our enemies, we are giving them power over us: power over our sleep, our appetites, our blood pressure, our health, and our happiness. —DALE CARNEGIE Lauren was convinced her overbearing, meddling mother-in-law was going to ruin her marriage, if not her entire life. Although she had thought her mother-in-law, Jackie, was annoying in the past, it wasn’t until she and her husband had two children together that she found her to be unbearable. Jackie usually made several unannounced visits each week, and she often stayed for several hours at a time. Lauren found those visits to be intrusive on their family time because she only had so much time with her girls between the time she came home from work and the time they went to bed. But what really bothered Lauren was the way Jackie always tried to undermine her authority with the girls. Jackie would often say things to the children like “You know, a little TV won’t hurt you. I don’t know why your mother always says you can’t watch it” or “I’d let you have dessert but your mother’s convinced sugar is bad for your health.” She sometimes lectured Lauren about her “new age parenting” and reminded her that she allowed her children to watch TV and eat sweets and they seemed to turn out just fine. Lauren always responded to Jackie’s comments with a polite nod and a smile, but on the inside, she was seething. She grew resentful toward Jackie and she often took it out on her husband. But whenever Lauren complained to her husband about his mother, he’d say something like “Well, you know how she is,” or “Just ignore her comments. She means well.” Lauren found comfort in complaining to her girlfriends who had affectionately named Jackie the “monster-in-law.” But one week, everything seemed to come to a head when Jackie suggested Lauren should start exercising more because she looked like she had gained a little weight. That comment pushed Lauren over the edge. She stormed out of the house and spent the night at her sister’s. The next day, she still didn’t feel ready to go home. She was afraid she’d have to hear a lecture from Jackie about how she shouldn’t have left. It was at that point Lauren knew she had to get help or her marriage might be in jeopardy. Lauren initially sought counseling to learn anger management skills to help her respond less angrily to her mother-in-law’s comments. However, after a few therapy sessions, she was able to see that she needed to work on being more proactive in preventing problems, not just less reactive toward Jackie’s comments. I asked Lauren to complete a pie chart that showed how much time and energy she focused on various areas of her life, such as work, sleep, leisure, family, and time with her mother-in-law. I then asked her to complete a second pie chart that showed how many hours she physically spent doing each activity. When she was done with the second pie chart, she was surprised to see how much her time and energy were out of proportion. Although she only physically spent about five hours a week with her mother-in-law, she was devoting at least an additional five hours thinking and talking about her disdain for her. This exercise helped her see how she was giving her mother-in-law power over many areas of her life. When she could have devoted her energy to nurturing her relationship with her husband or caring for her children, she was often thinking about how much she disliked Jackie. Once Lauren recognized how much power she was giving Jackie, she chose to start making some changes. She worked with her husband on setting healthy boundaries for their family. Together, they established rules that would help them limit the influence Jackie had on their family. They told Jackie that she could no longer make unannounced visits several times per week. Instead, they would invite her over for dinner when they wanted to visit with her. They also informed her that she could no longer undermine Lauren’s authority as a mother, and if she did, she’d be asked to leave. Lauren also chose to stop complaining about Jackie. She recognized that venting to her friends and her husband only fueled her frustration and wasted her time and energy. Slowly, but surely, Lauren began to feel like she was getting her life and her house back. She no longer dreaded Jackie’s visits once she recognized she didn’t have to tolerate rude or disrespectful behavior in her home. Instead, she could control what went on under her own roof. EMPOWERING OTHER PEOPLE TO HAVE POWER OVER YOU Giving other people the power to control how you think, feel, and behave makes it impossible to be mentally strong. Do any of the points below sound familiar? You feel deeply offended by any criticism or negative feedback you receive, regardless of the source. Other people have the ability to make you feel so angry that you say and do things you later regret. You’ve changed your goals based on what other people have told you that you should be doing with your life. The type of day you’re going to have depends on how other people behave. When other people try to guilt you into doing something, you reluctantly do it, even if you don’t want to. You work hard to ensure other people see you in a positive light because much of your self-worth depends on how others perceive you. You spend a lot of time complaining about people and circumstances that you don’t like. You often complain about all the things you “have to” do in life. You go to great lengths to avoid uncomfortable emotions, like embarrassment or sadness. You have difficulty setting boundaries, but then feel resentful toward people who take up your time and energy. You hold a grudge when someone offends you or hurts you. Can you see yourself in any of the above examples? Retaining your power is about being confident in who you are and the choices you make, despite the people around you and the circumstances you’re in. WHY WE GIVE AWAY OUR POWER Lauren was clear that she really wanted to be a nice person, and she thought that being a good wife meant tolerating her mother-in-law at all costs. She felt it would be disrespectful to ask her mother-in-law not to come over and she was hesitant to speak up when her feelings were hurt. She’d been raised to “turn the other cheek” when someone treated her poorly. But with help, she was able to see that setting healthy boundaries wasn’t being mean or disrespectful. Instead, setting limits on what was allowed in her own home was healthy for her family and less taxing on her mental strength. Anytime you don’t set healthy emotional and physical boundaries for yourself, you risk giving away your power to other people. Perhaps you don’t dare say no when your neighbor asks for a favor. Or maybe you dread receiving a phone call from a friend who constantly complains, but you continue to pick up on the first ring. Each time you avoid saying no to something you really don’t want, you give away your power. If you don’t make any attempt to get your needs met, you’ll give people permission to take things away from you. A lack of emotional boundaries can be equally problematic. If you don’t like the way someone treats you, yet you don’t stand up for yourself, you give that person power over your life. THE PROBLEM WITH GIVING AWAY YOUR POWER Lauren allowed her mother-in-law to control what sort of an evening she was going to have. If Jackie showed up, Lauren felt angry and bitter about the fact that she wasn’t getting to spend quality time with her children. On the days Jackie didn’t come to her home, Lauren felt much more relaxed. She allowed Jackie’s behavior to interfere with her relationship with her children, as well as her marriage. Instead of spending her spare time talking to her husband and her friends about enjoyable subjects, she wasted her energy complaining about Jackie. She even found herself sometimes volunteering to work late because she wasn’t excited about going home when she knew Jackie was going to be there. The longer she gave her power to Jackie, the more helpless she became about fixing it. There are many problems with giving away your power: • You depend on others to regulate your feelings. When you give away your power, you become completely dependent upon other people and external circumstances to regulate your emotions. Life often becomes like a roller coaster—when things are going well, you’ll feel good; but when your circumstances change, your thoughts, feelings, and behavior will shift. • You let other people define your self-worth. If you give others the power to determine your self-worth, you’ll never feel worthy enough. You’ll only be as good as someone else’s opinion of you and you will never be able to receive enough praise or positive feedback to meet your needs if you depend on others to feel good about yourself. • You avoid addressing the real problem. Giving away your power lends itself to helplessness. Rather than focus on what you can do to improve the situation, you’ll find an excuse to justify your problems. • You become a victim of your circumstances. You’ll become a passenger in your own life rather than a driver. You’ll say other people make you feel bad or force you to behave in a manner you don’t like. You’ll blame others instead of accepting responsibility for your choices. • You become highly sensitive to criticism. You’ll lack the ability to evaluate criticism. Instead, you’ll take anything anyone says to heart. You’ll give much more power to other people’s words than those words deserve. • You lose sight of your goals. You won’t be able to build the kind of life you want when you allow other people to be in control of your goals. You can’t work toward your goals successfully when you give other people the power to get in your way and interfere with your progress. • You ruin relationships. If you don’t speak up when people hurt your feelings or you allow them to infringe on your life in an unwelcomed manner, you’ll likely grow resentful toward them. RECLAIM YOUR POWER Without confidence in who you are, your entire self-worth may depend on how others feel about you. What if you offend people? What if they don’t like you anymore? If you choose to put up healthy boundaries, you may receive some backlash. But if you have a strong enough sense of self-worth, you’ll learn that you can tolerate the repercussions. Lauren learned that she could be firm with her mother-in-law, while still behaving respectfully. Although she was terrified of confrontation, Lauren and her husband explained their concerns to Jackie together. Initially, Jackie was offended when they told her she could not come over every night. And Jackie tried to argue when they explained that she would not be allowed to make rude comments about Lauren’s rules for the children. But, over time, Jackie accepted that she had to follow these rules if she wanted to come into their home. IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN YOUR POWER Steven McDonald is an incredible example of someone who chose not to give away his power. While working as a New York City police officer in 1986, Officer McDonald stopped to question some teenagers about some recent bicycle thefts. One of the fifteen-year-olds in question took out a gun and shot Officer McDonald in the head and neck. The shots paralyzed him from the neck down. Miraculously, Officer McDonald survived. He spent eighteen months in the hospital recuperating and learning how to live as a quadriplegic. At the time of the accident, he’d only been married eight months, and his wife was six months pregnant. Remarkably, Officer McDonald and his wife chose not to focus on all that had been taken away from them by this teenage boy. Instead, they made a conscious choice to forgive him. In fact, a few years after his injury, the officer’s assailant called him from jail to apologize. Officer McDonald not only accepted his apology, but he also told him that he hoped someday they could travel the country together sharing their story with the hope they could prevent other acts of violence. Officer McDonald never got the chance to do that, however, because three days after his assailant was released from prison, the young man was killed in a motorcycle accident. So Officer McDonald set out on his mission to spread his message about peace and forgiveness on his own. “The only thing worse than a bullet in my spine would have been to nurture revenge in my heart,” he says in the book Why Forgive? He may have lost his physical mobility in that attack, but he didn’t give that violent incident or his assailant the power to ruin his life. He’s now a highly sought after speaker who teaches love, respect, and forgiveness. Officer McDonald is an inspirational example of someone who, despite being the victim of a senseless act of violence, chose not to waste time giving his assailant more power. Choosing to forgive someone who has hurt you, either emotionally or physically, doesn’t mean you have to excuse the other person’s behavior, but letting go of your anger frees you to focus your energy on a more worthwhile cause. If you’ve spent most of your life feeling like a victim of your circumstances, it takes hard work to recognize that you have the power to choose your own path in life. The first step is to develop self-awareness by identifying when you blame external circumstances and other people for how you think, feel, and behave. Take a close look at the people you are devoting your time and energy toward. Are they the people you want to receive it? If not, you may be giving them more power than you think they deserve. Each second you spend commiserating with coworkers about how unfair your boss is, you are giving your boss more power. Every time you tell your friends how controlling your mother-in-law is, you give her a little more power over you. Resolve to stop giving people your time and energy if you don’t want them to play a big role in your life. REFRAME YOUR LANGUAGE Sometimes retaining your power means changing the way you look at the situation. Examples of language that indicates you’re giving away your power include: • “My boss makes me so mad.” You may not like your boss’s behavior, but does he really make you feel angry? Perhaps your boss behaves in a manner that you don’t like and it may influence how you feel, but he’s not forcing you to feel anything. • “My boyfriend left me because I’m not good enough.” Are you really not good enough or is that just one person’s opinion? If you took a poll of a hundred people, it’s not likely that they’d all come to that same consensus. Just because one person thinks something, it doesn’t make it true. Don’t give one person’s opinion of you the power to determine who you are. • “My mom makes me feel really bad about myself because she’s always so critical of me.” As an adult, are you obligated to listen to your mother make critical statements about you over and over? Just because she makes comments you don’t like, does it really have to lower your self-esteem? • “I have to invite my in-laws over for dinner every Sunday night.” Do your in-laws really force you to do that or is that a choice you make because it’s important to your family? THINK BEFORE YOU REACT Rachel brought her sixteen-year-old daughter to me for therapy because her daughter refused to listen to her. No matter what she told her daughter to do, she just wouldn’t do it. I asked Rachel how she reacted when her daughter refused to follow her directions. Out of exasperation, she told me, she yelled and argued with her. Each time her daughter said, “No!,” Rachel yelled, “Do it!” Rachel didn’t realize it, but she was giving her daughter a lot of power. Every minute that she argued with her daughter was one more minute her daughter could put off cleaning her room. Each time she lost her temper, Rachel gave away some of her power. Instead of controlling her daughter’s behavior, Rachel was giving her daughter power to control her. If someone says something you don’t like, and you yell or begin to argue, you give those words you don’t like even more power. Make a conscious choice to think about how you want to behave before you react to other people. Every time you lose your cool, you give that other person your power. Here are some strategies to help you stay calm when you’re tempted to react negatively: • Take deep breaths. Frustration and anger cause physical reactions within the body—an increased rate of breathing, an elevated heart rate, and sweating to name a few. Taking slow, deep breaths can relax your muscles and decrease the physiological response, which in turn can decrease your emotional reactivity. • Excuse yourself from the situation. The more emotional you feel, the less rational you’ll think. Learn to recognize your personal warning signs of anger—such as shaking or feeling flushed—and remove yourself from the situation before you lose your cool. This may mean saying, “I am not willing to talk about that right now,” or it may mean walking away. • Distract yourself. Don’t try solving a problem or addressing an issue with someone when you’re feeling overly emotional. Instead, distract yourself with an activity, like walking or reading, to help you calm down. Getting your mind off what’s bothering you, even for a few minutes, can help you calm down so you can think more rationally. EVALUATE FEEDBACK CRITICALLY Not long before she released an album that sold over ten million copies, Madonna received a rejection letter from the president of Millennium Records that said, “The only thing missing from this project is the material.” Had Madonna allowed that letter to define her singing and songwriting abilities, she might have given up. But fortunately, she kept looking for opportunities in the music industry. Soon after that rejection letter, she landed a record deal that launched her career. Within a couple of decades, Madonna was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the bestselling female recording artist of all time. She holds numerous other records, including the top-touring female artist of all time, and she’s ranked second on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists—second only to the Beatles. Almost every successful person likely has a similar story of rejection. In 1956, Andy Warhol tried to give one of his paintings to the Museum of Modern Art, but they declined to accept it even for free. Fast-forward to 1989, and his paintings had become so successful that he earned his own museum. The Andy Warhol Museum is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Clearly, everyone has an opinion, but successful people don’t allow one person’s opinion to define them. Retaining your power is about evaluating feedback to determine if it has any validity. While criticism can sometimes open our eyes to how others perceive us so we can make positive change—a friend points out a bad habit, or a spouse helps you see your selfish behavior—at other times, criticism is a reflection of the critic. Angry people may choose to offer harsh criticism quite regularly just because it relieves their stress. Or individuals with low self-esteem may feel better about themselves only when they put other people down. So it’s important to really consider the source before making any decisions about how you want to proceed. When you receive criticism or feedback from others, wait a beat before responding. If you’re upset or emotionally reactive, take the time to calm down. Then ask yourself these questions: • What evidence is there that this is true? For example, if your boss says you are lazy, look for evidence of times when you haven’t worked very hard. • What evidence do I have this isn’t true? Look for times when you have put in a lot of effort and have been a hard worker. • Why might this person be giving me this feedback? Take a step back and see if you can find out why this person may be giving you negative feedback. Is it based on the small sampling of your behavior that the person has witnessed? For example, if your boss only watched you work on a day where you were coming down with the flu, she may decide that you aren’t very productive. Her conclusion may not be accurate. • Do I want to change any of my behavior? There may be times where you choose to change your behavior because you agree with the other person’s criticism. For example, if your boss says you’re lazy, maybe you’ll decide that you haven’t been putting in as much effort at the office as you could. So you decide to start showing up early and staying late because it’s important to you to be a good worker. Just remember, though, that your boss isn’t forcing you to do anything different. You are choosing to create change because you want to, not because you have to. Keep in mind that one person’s opinion of you doesn’t make it true. You can respectfully choose to disagree and move on without devoting time and energy into trying to change the other person’s mind. RECOGNIZE YOUR CHOICES There are very few things in life you have to do, but often we convince ourselves we don’t have a choice. Instead of saying, “I have to go to work tomorrow,” remind yourself that it’s a choice. If you choose not to go to work, there will be consequences. Perhaps you won’t get paid. Or maybe you’ll risk losing your job altogether. But it’s a choice. Simply reminding yourself that you have a choice in everything you do, think, and feel can be very freeing. If you’ve spent most of your life feeling like a victim of your circumstances, it takes hard work to recognize that you have the power to create the kind of life you want to live. TAKING BACK YOUR POWER WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER You don’t get to be named one of the most powerful people in the world by giving away your power. Just ask Oprah Winfrey. She grew up in extreme poverty and was sexually abused by several people throughout her childhood. She bounced between living with her mother, father, and grandmother, and as a teenager, she frequently ran away from home. She became pregnant at age fourteen, but the infant died shortly after birth. During her high school years, she began working at a local radio station. She worked her way through several media jobs, and eventually, she landed a job as a TV news anchor. But she was later fired from the position. She didn’t allow one person’s opinion of her on-air suitability to stop her, however. She went on to create her own talk show and by the age of thirty-two, her show became a national hit. By the age of forty-one, she had a reported net worth of over 340 million. Oprah has started her own magazine, radio show, and TV network and has coauthored five books. She’s even won an Academy Award. She’s started a multitude of charities to help people in need, including a leadership academy for girls in South Africa. Oprah didn’t let her childhood or her former employer take away her power. A woman who was once teased because she was so poor she wore potato sacks as dresses was named one of the world’s most powerful women by both CNN and Time. Statistically, her upbringing would have predicted a poor prognosis. But Oprah refused to be a statistic. She chose to define who she was going to be in life by not giving away her power. When you decide that no one else has the power to control how you feel, you’ll experience empowerment. Here are some other ways how retaining your power will help you become mentally strong: • You’ll develop a better sense of who you are when you’re able to make choices based on what’s best for you instead of what will prevent the most repercussions. • When you take responsibility for your own behavior, you’ll become accountable for your progress toward your goals. • You will never be pressured into doing something that you don’t want to do based on guilt trips or what you think other people want you to do. • You’ll be able to devote your time and energy to things you choose. You won’t have to blame other people for wasting your time or ruining your day. • Retaining your personal power reduces your risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Many mental health problems are linked to a sense of hopelessness and helplessness. When you decide not to give other people and external circumstances the power to control how you feel and behave, you gain more power over your mental health. When you hold a grudge, those feelings of anger and resentment do nothing to lessen the other person’s life. Instead, harboring anger and resentment gives that person more power to interfere with your quality of life. Choosing to forgive allows you to take back your power, not just over your psychological health, but also over your physical health. Research shows some of the health benefits of forgiveness include the following: • Forgiveness reduces your stress. Over the years, many studies have shown that holding a grudge keeps your body in a state of stress. When you practice forgiveness, your blood pressure and heart rate decrease. • Choosing to forgive increases your tolerance to pain. In a 2005 study of patients with chronic low back pain, anger increased psychological distress and decreased a person’s tolerance to pain. A willingness to forgive was associated with increased pain tolerance. • Unconditional forgiveness can help you to live longer. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine discovered that when people were only willing to forgive others under certain conditions—like the other person apologized or promised to never repeat the same behavior—their risk of dying early actually increased. You don’t have any control over whether someone will apologize. Waiting to forgive people until they say they’re sorry gives them control over not just your life, but perhaps even your death. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS Monitor your personal power and look for ways in which you are voluntarily giving it away. It takes hard work, but increasing your mental strength requires you to retain every ounce of personal power for yourself. WHAT’S HELPFUL Using language that acknowledges your choice such as, “I’m choosing to . . .” Setting healthy emotional and physical boundaries with people Behaving proactively by making conscious choices about how you’ll respond to others Taking full responsibility for how you choose to spend your time and energy Choosing to forgive individuals regardless of whether they seek to make amends Willingness to examine feedback and criticism without jumping to conclusions WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Using language that implies you’re a victim, such as “I have to do this,” or “My boss makes me so mad” Feeling anger and resentment toward people you allow to infringe on your rights Reacting to others and then blaming them for the way you handled yourself Doing things you don’t want to do and then blaming others for “making” you do it Choosing to hold a grudge and harbor anger and resentment Allowing feedback and criticism to control how you feel about yourself OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 3 THEY DON’T SHY AWAY FROM CHANGE It’s not that some people have willpower and some don’t . . . It’s that some people are ready to change and others are not. —JAMES GORDON Richard entered my therapy office because he wasn’t making much progress in managing his physical health. At the age of forty-four, he was seventy-five pounds overweight and had recently been diagnosed with diabetes. Shortly after his diagnosis, he’d met with a nutritionist and learned about the diet changes he’d need to make to lose weight and manage his blood sugar. Initially, he tried eliminating all the junk food he had always eaten so regularly. He’d gone so far as to throw away all the ice cream, cookies, and sugary soft drinks he had in his home. But within two days, he found himself buying more sweets and resorting to his old habits. He was also aware that he’d need to increase his activity level if he wanted to get healthier. After all, he was no stranger to exercise. Back in high school, he’d been a star athlete on the football field and the basketball court. But these days, he spent the majority of his time sitting behind a computer. He worked long hours and wasn’t sure how he’d find the time to exercise. He’d purchased a gym membership, but he’d only gone to the gym twice. He usually came home from work exhausted, and he already felt like he wasn’t spending enough time with his wife and children. Richard told me that he really wanted to get healthier. But he felt frustrated. Despite understanding the risks of being overweight and the dangers of not managing his diabetes, he just couldn’t motivate himself to change his unhealthy habits. It was clear that he was trying to change too much too fast, which is a recipe for failure. I recommended he choose one thing to change at a time and for the first week, he said he’d give up the cookies he usually ate at his desk during the afternoon. It was important to find something to replace that habit with—and he decided he would try snacking on carrot sticks instead. I also recommended he gain support to help him become healthier. He agreed to attend a diabetes support group. And over the next few weeks we discussed strategies to help get his family involved. His wife attended a few therapy sessions with him, and she began to understand steps she could take to help Richard improve his health. She agreed not to buy as much junk food when she went grocery shopping, and she began working with Richard on finding healthier recipes for their meals. We also discussed a realistic exercise schedule. Richard said that almost every day he left the house planning to go to the gym after work, but he always talked himself out of it and went straight home. We decided he’d start by going to the gym three days a week and he scheduled those three days ahead of time. He also kept a list of all the reasons why going to the gym was a good idea in the car. On the days when he began thinking that he should just go home instead of going to the gym, he read over his list as a reminder about why going to the gym was the best choice, even if he didn’t feel like it. Over the next two months, Richard began losing weight. But his blood sugar was still fairly high. He admitted that he was still eating a lot of junk food in the evenings while he watched TV. I encouraged him to find ways to make it less convenient for him to reach for sugary snacks, so he decided that he’d keep the sweet treats downstairs in the basement. Then, when he wandered into the kitchen in the evenings, he’d be more likely to reach for a healthy snack. If he still wanted cookies, he’d have to think about whether he wanted to go down to the basement to get them and most of the time, he found that he was more motivated to reach for a healthier snack. As soon as he started making progress, he found it easier to make more changes. Eventually, he was able to feel more inspired to lose weight and manage his blood sugar. TO CHANGE OR NOT TO CHANGE Although it’s often easy to say you want to change, successfully making a change is hard. Our thoughts and emotions often prevent us from creating behavioral change, even when it will improve our lives. Many people shy away from making changes that can drastically improve their lives. See if any of the following apply to you: You tend to justify a bad habit by convincing yourself what you’re doing isn’t “that bad.” You experience a lot of anxiety about changes to your routine. Even when you’re in a bad situation, you worry that making a change might make things worse. Whenever you attempt to make a change, you struggle to stick with it. When your boss, family, or friends make changes that affect you, it’s difficult for you to adapt. You think a lot about making changes but put off doing anything different until later. You worry that any changes you make aren’t likely to last. The thought of stepping outside your comfort zone just seems too scary. You lack the motivation to create positive change because it’s too hard. You make excuses for why you can’t change, like “I’d like to exercise more, but my spouse doesn’t want to go with me.” You have difficulty recalling the last time you purposely tried to challenge yourself to become better. You hesitate to do anything new because it just seems like too big of a commitment. Do any of the above examples sound familiar? Although circumstances can change quickly, humans often change at a much slower pace. Choosing to do something different requires you to adapt your thinking and your behavior, which will likely bring up some uncomfortable emotions. But that doesn’t mean you should shy away from change. WHY WE SHY AWAY FROM CHANGE Initially, Richard tried to change too much too fast and he quickly became overwhelmed. Whenever he thought, This is going to be too hard, he allowed himself to give up. As soon as he began seeing some positive results, however, his thoughts became more positive and it was easier for him to stay motivated. Many people shy away from change because they think that doing something different is too risky or uncomfortable. TYPES OF CHANGE We can experience different types of change, some you might find easier than others: • All-or-nothing change—Some changes are incremental while others are basically all or nothing. Deciding to have a child, for example, isn’t something you can do in steps. Once you have that baby, your life has irrevocably changed. • Habit change—You can choose to either get rid of bad habits, like sleeping too late, or you can choose to create good habits, like exercising five times a week. Most habit changes allow you to try something new for a little while, but you can always revert back to your old habits. • Trying-something-new change—Change sometimes involves trying something new or mixing up your daily routine, like volunteering at a hospital or taking violin lessons. • Behavioral change—Sometimes there are behavioral changes that don’t necessarily constitute a habit. For example, maybe you want to commit to going to all of your child’s sports games or maybe you want to behave friendlier. • Emotional change—Not all change is tangible. Sometimes it’s emotional. For example, if you want to feel less irritable all the time, you’ll need to examine the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to your irritability. • Cognitive change—There may be ways in which you want to change your thinking as well. Perhaps you want to think less about the past or maybe decrease worrisome thoughts. READINESS FOR CHANGE New Year’s resolutions are commonly broken, because we try to make changes based on a date and not because we’re really ready. And if you aren’t ready to create change, you likely won’t be successful at maintaining it. Even changing one small habit, like deciding you’ll floss your teeth every day or giving up your bedtime snack, requires a certain level of commitment. THE FIVE STAGES OF CHANGE 1. Precontemplation—When people are precontemplative, they don’t yet identify any need to change. Richard was precontemplative about making any changes to his health for years. He avoided going to the doctor, he refused to step on a scale, and he dismissed any comments his wife made when she expressed concern about his health. 2. Contemplation—People who are actively contemplative are considering the pros and cons of making a change. When I first saw Richard, he was contemplative. He was aware that not changing his eating habits could have serious consequences, but he was also not yet certain how to go about creating change. 3. Preparation—This is the stage where people prepare to make a change. They establish a plan with concrete steps that identify what they are going to do differently. Once Richard moved into the preparation stage, he scheduled days to work out and chose one snack to swap for something healthier. 4. Action—This is where the concrete behavioral change takes place. Richard started going to the gym and swapped his afternoon cookies for carrots. 5. Maintenance—This often overlooked step is essential. Richard needed to plan ahead so he could maintain his lifestyle changes when he faced obstacles, like holidays or vacations. FEAR When I met Andrew, he was stuck in a low-paying job that didn’t challenge him. He had a college degree—and the student loans to prove it—but he was working in a field that didn’t use any of his skills. There was little opportunity for advancement. A few months prior to our first session, he’d gotten into a car accident. Not only was his car totaled, but he’d racked up some hefty medical bills. He was underinsured in terms of both his health and his vehicle, and he was experiencing serious financial problems. Despite feeling a lot of stress about his financial situation, Andrew was afraid to apply for new jobs. He worried that he might not like a different job, and he lacked confidence in his skills. He also dreaded the thought of getting used to a new office, a new boss, and different coworkers. I helped Andrew examine the pros and cons of a job change. Once Andrew developed a budget, he was able to examine the facts of the situation. Staying at his current job would make it impossible to pay for his bills each month. Even without a single unexpected expense, he would be at least 200 shy of paying his bills. Facing this reality gave Andrew the motivation he needed to begin applying for new jobs. The fear of not being able to pay his bills had to outweigh the fear of getting a new job that paid better. Just like Andrew, many people worry that doing something different may make things even worse. Maybe you don’t like the house you’re living in, but you worry that a new home could have even bigger problems. Or maybe you worry about ending a relationship because you are afraid you won’t ever find anyone better. So you convince yourself to keep things the same, even if you’re not happy. AVOIDING DISCOMFORT Many people associate change with discomfort. And often, they underestimate their ability to tolerate the discomfort that accompanies a behavioral change. Richard knew what changes he needed to make to improve his health, but he didn’t want to give up foods he liked or feel the pain that accompanies a workout. And he worried that losing weight meant he’d have to be hungry. He dreaded all those realities, but he didn’t realize that these slight discomforts were just that, and nothing worse. It wasn’t until he began gaining confidence in his ability to tolerate discomfort that he truly felt like making further changes. GRIEF Tiffany came to therapy because she wanted to change her spending habits. Her shopping had become out of control, and she felt stressed because she was carrying around huge credit card balances. She didn’t want to keep spending but at the same time, she didn’t want to change. When we discussed some of her concerns about what would happen if she tried to stick to a budget, she discovered that she didn’t want to give up time with her friends, because she and her girlfriends often spent Saturday afternoons shopping together. She thought the only way to curb her spending meant giving up time with her friends, which she feared would lead to loneliness. Doing something different means giving something up. And there’s often a grief associated with leaving something behind. To spare ourselves this grief, we can convince ourselves not to change. Tiffany would have rather held on to her girls’ day at the mall than avoid financial ruin. THE PROBLEM WITH SHYING AWAY FROM CHANGE Shying away from change can have serious consequences. In Richard’s case, continuing his current habits would likely take a serious toll on his health. The longer he delayed making change, the more irreversible damage he was likely to suffer. But avoiding change doesn’t always have just physical consequences. Remaining stagnant can also interfere with personal growth in other areas of your life. • Staying the same often equals getting stuck in a rut. Life can get pretty boring if you don’t do anything differently. A person who simply decides to keep things as mundane and low-key as possible isn’t likely to experience a rich, full life and might become depressed. • You won’t learn new things. The world will change with or without you. Don’t think that your choice not to change will prevent anyone else from embracing change. You’ll risk being left in the dust if you choose to keep doing everything the same for the rest of your life. • Your life may not get better. If you don’t change, you can’t make your life better. Many problems that are waiting to be solved require you to do something different. But if you aren’t willing to try something new, those issues are likely to remain unresolved. • You won’t challenge yourself to develop healthier habits. It’s easy to develop bad habits. Breaking bad habits requires a willingness to try something new. • Other people will outgrow you. “My husband isn’t the same man I married thirty years ago.” I hear this all the time in my office, and my response is usually, “Let’s hope not.” I hope everyone grows and changes over the course of thirty years. If you are unwilling to challenge yourself and improve, others may grow bored with you. • The longer you wait the harder it gets. Do you think it’s easier to quit smoking after your first cigarette or after twenty years of smoking? The longer you keep the same habits, the harder they can be to break. Sometimes people put off change until the right time. They say things like “I’ll look for a new job when things calm down” or “I’ll worry about losing weight after the holidays.” But, often, the perfect time to do something never arises. The longer change gets delayed, the harder it is to do. ACCEPT CHANGE I first learned of Mary Deming from one of her close friends who couldn’t stop saying enough good things about her. And when I heard Mary’s story, I began to understand why. But it wasn’t until I spoke with her that it truly hit me. When Mary was eighteen, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Three short years later, her mother passed away. Following her mother’s death, Mary admits she buried her head in the sand. She says she vacillated between feeling sorry for herself—her father had passed away when she was a teen so she felt it was unfair she was an “orphan” at 21—and busying herself with as much activity as possible so she didn’t have to face the reality of her situation. But in 2000, at the age of fifty—the same age her father had been when he passed away—Mary began thinking about her own mortality. That same year, as a high school teacher, Mary was asked to chaperone a school-sponsored fund-raiser for cancer research. Chaperoning that event provided Mary with an opportunity to meet with other people who had lost loved ones to cancer and the fund-raiser ignited her passion to make a difference. She began participating in fund-raising events for cancer research. Initially, she joined the American Cancer Society’s “Relay for Life” as her first fund-raiser walk. Then, in 2008, she joined the three-day sixty-mile walk sponsored by Susan G. Komen that was specifically aimed at raising money for breast cancer. Mary had always been a competitive person and when she saw how much money other people were able to raise, she kicked it into high gear and single-handedly raised 38,000, one thousand dollars for each year her mother had been gone. But instead of patting herself on the back for a job well done, Mary credits the people in her small town with helping her raise the funds. And her fund-raising endeavors made her recognize that raising money for cancer research was near and dear to her neighbors’ hearts. She began to do some research and she discovered that her home state of Connecticut had the second highest rate of breast cancer in the nation. And that sparked an idea. Mary decided to start her own nonprofit agency to raise money, and she got the entire community involved. She named her organization Seymour Pink, after her town of Seymour, Connecticut. Each October—breast cancer awareness month—the town makes sure everyone has an opportunity to “see more pink.” Businesses decorate with pink. Pink banners honoring survivors and memorializing loved ones who have lost their battle to breast cancer are hung on the light posts throughout the town. Homes are decorated with pink ribbons and balloons. Over the years, Mary has raised almost a half million dollars for breast cancer–related causes. Her organization donates some money for cancer research and also provides direct financial support to families who are affected by cancer. Not only does Mary not take any of the credit—she only boasts about how wonderful her community members are who participate in her fund-raisers—but she also fails to mention her personal triumphs. I only learned about the obstacles she overcame because someone else told me. Just three years into her fund-raising efforts, Mary was in a severe car accident. A traumatic brain injury left her with significant speech and cognitive issues. But even a serious car accident couldn’t hold someone like Mary back. She went to speech therapy eight times a week and was determined to get back to raising money for breast cancer patients and research. At a time when most people would have retired, Mary said, “I’m not going out like that.” She knew it would be a long road to recovery but she didn’t believe in quitting. It took her five years, but by 2008, she returned to her job as a high school science teacher and resumed her fund-raising efforts. Mary didn’t set out to change the world. Instead, she focused on what she could do to make a difference. If you start by changing your life, you can begin to make a difference in the lives of other people. Mother Teresa said, “I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.” Mary Deming didn’t set out to change the entire world either, but she sure has changed a lot of lives. IDENTIFY THE PROS AND CONS OF CHANGING Create a list of what is good about staying the same and what is bad about staying the same. Then, create a list about the potentially good and bad outcomes of making a change. Don’t simply make your decision based on the sheer number of pros versus cons. Instead, examine the list. Read it over a few times and think about the potential consequences of changing versus staying the same. If you’re still considering change, this exercise can help you move closer to making a decision. There’s no need to change for the sake of change. Moving to a new home, starting a new relationship, or switching jobs aren’t inherently going to increase your mental strength. Instead, it’s important to pay close attention to the reasons why you want to change so you can determine whether the decision is about doing what’s ultimately best for you. If you’re still ambivalent, create a behavioral experiment. Unless you’re dealing with an all-or-nothing change, try something new for one week. After you’ve done it for a week, evaluate your progress and motivation. Decide if you want to continue with the change or not. DEVELOP AN AWARENESS OF YOUR EMOTIONS Pay attention to the emotions that are influencing your decision as well. When you think about making a change, how do you feel? For example: • Are you nervous that the change won’t last? • Do you feel exhausted at the sheer thought of doing something different? • Are you worried about your ability to follow through with the change? • Are you scared things may get worse? • Are you sad that you’ll have to give something up? • Are you uncomfortable even admitting a problem exists? Once you identify some of your emotions, you can decide whether it makes sense to act contrary to those emotions. Richard, for example, felt a variety of emotions. He was nervous about committing to something new. He was feeling guilty that he may need to give up time with his family to exercise and he was worried that he wouldn’t be successful at managing his health. Despite all that, he was even more fearful about what would happen to him if he didn’t make a change. Don’t allow your emotions to make the final decision. Sometimes you have to be willing to change, even when you don’t “feel like it.” Balance your emotions with rational thinking. If you’re terrified of doing something new, and it really won’t make a big difference in your life, you may decide it’s not worth putting yourself through the stress of change. But, if you can rationally identify how change will be best for you in the long term, it may make sense to tolerate the discomfort. MANAGE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS Look for unrealistically negative thoughts that may be influencing you. Once you’ve started to make changes, the way you think about the process can also greatly affect how motivated you’ll be to keep going. Be on the alert for these types of thoughts that will tempt you to shy away from change: • This will never work. • I can’t handle doing something different. • It will be too hard. • It’ll be too stressful to give up the things I like. • What I’m doing now isn’t that bad. • There’s no sense in trying because I tried something like that before and it didn’t help. • I don’t deal with change well. Just because you think it will be difficult doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Often, some of the best things in life come from our ability to conquer a challenge through hard work. CREATE A SUCCESSFUL PLAN FOR CHANGE Preparing for the change can be the most important step. Create a plan for how you’ll implement the change and how you’ll stick to it. Once you have a plan in place, then you can implement the behavioral change one small step at a time. Initially, Richard told himself he needed to lose seventy-five pounds. Thinking about that huge number however, overwhelmed him. He just didn’t think it was possible. He started each day with the best of intentions, but by the evening, he slid back into his old habits. It wasn’t until he began focusing on what he could do today that he was able to start making helpful behavioral changes. By establishing smaller goals, such as losing five pounds, he was able to create action steps that he could do each day. He kept a food journal, packed his lunch instead of dining out, and went for a short walk with his family on the days he didn’t go to the gym. Unless you’re dealing with an all-or-nothing type of change, you can create change in incremental steps. Prepare for making the change with these steps: • Create a goal for what you would like to accomplish in the next thirty days. Sometimes people try to change everything all at once. Identify one goal that you want to focus on first and establish a realistic expectation for what you’d like to see change in one month’s time. • Establish concrete behavior changes you can make to reach that goal each day. Identify at least one step you can take each day to move closer to your goal. • Anticipate obstacles along the way. Make a plan for how you will respond to specific challenges that you’re likely to encounter. Planning ahead can help you stay on track. • Establish accountability. We do best when we establish some type of accountability for our progress. Enlist the help of friends and family who can provide support and check in with you about your progress. Be accountable to yourself by writing down your progress daily. • Monitor your progress. Determine how you’ll keep track of your progress. Keeping a record of your efforts and daily achievements can help you stay motivated to maintain changes. BEHAVE LIKE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BECOME If your goal is to be more outgoing, behave in a friendly manner. If you want to be a successful salesperson, study how successful salespeople behave and then do what they do. You don’t necessarily have to wait until you feel like it or until the right time comes; start changing your behavior now. Richard wanted to be healthier, so he needed to behave like a healthy person. Eating a healthy diet and engaging in more physical activity were two things Richard could start doing to get closer to his goals. Clearly identify the type of person you’d like to be. Then, be proactive about becoming that person. So often I hear, “I wish I could have more friends.” Don’t wait for friends to come to you; start acting like a friendly person now and you can develop new friendships. EMBRACING CHANGE WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER Judge Greg Mathis was raised in the projects of Detroit during the 1960s and 1970s. As a teenager, he was arrested many times, and he dropped out of school to join a gang. At the age of seventeen, while incarcerated at a juvenile detention center, his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Mathis was offered early probation as a result of her illness and promised his dying mother he’d turn his life around once and for all. His probation terms required him to maintain a job, and he began working at McDonald’s. He was accepted to Eastern Michigan University and went on to law school. Due to his criminal history, he wasn’t able to get a job as a lawyer, but that didn’t stop him from finding ways to help the city of Detroit. He became manager of the Detroit Neighborhood City Halls. Around the same time, he and his wife established Young Adults Asserting Themselves, a nonprofit agency that helped young people find employment. A few years later, Mathis decided to run for judge. Although his opponents reminded the community of his criminal background, the people of Detroit believed Mathis was a changed man. Mathis was elected the youngest judge in Michigan’s history after beating out the twenty-year incumbent. Judge Mathis soon gained Hollywood attention and in 1999, he began a successful TV show where he settles small-claims disputes. Once a criminal himself, Judge Mathis now donates much of his time and energy to helping young people make better decisions in their lives. He tours the country offering Youth and Education Expos that encourage young people to make the best choices they can for their future. He’s received multiple awards and commendations for his ability to inspire young people to avoid making the same mistakes he made in his life. Sometimes change results in a complete transformation that could alter the entire course of your life. So often, when people become committed to create change in one area of their lives, like pay off their debt, before they know it, they’re also losing weight and their marriages improve. Positive change leads to increased motivation and increased motivation leads to more positive change. Embracing change is a two-way street. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS Unfortunately, your life will change whether you want it to or not. Change created by job loss, death of a loved one, a friend moving away, or kids moving out are all a part of life. When you practice adapting to the small changes, you’ll be better prepared to deal with the large inevitable changes that come your way. Pay attention to the way you handle change. Watch out for warning signs that you may be avoiding important change that could ultimately improve your life. Although change can feel uncomfortable, you won’t be able to increase your mental strength unless you’re willing to grow and improve. WHAT’S HELPFUL Evaluating your readiness to change with an open mind Setting a realistic time frame to establish and reach your goals Balancing your emotions and rational thoughts to help you make a decision about whether to do something different Willingness to anticipate potential obstacles that could interfere with your progress Reviewing the potential pros and cons of making a change as well as the pros and cons of staying the same Focusing on one small change at a time with clear action steps Committing to behaving like the person you want to become WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Ignoring or avoiding even thinking about change Putting off doing anything different until you reach certain milestones or until certain time frames have passed Allowing your emotions to dictate whether you want to change without considering the logical aspects of doing something different Making excuses for why you can’t do anything different Only focusing on the negative aspects of change without considering the positive Convincing yourself not to bother trying to change because you don’t think you can do it Waiting until you feel like creating change OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 4 THEY DON’T FOCUS ON THINGS THEY CAN’T CONTROL You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. —MAYA ANGELOU James entered my therapy office because he was upset by his ongoing custody battle. James had struggled with his ex-wife, Carmen, for custody of their seven-year-old daughter for over three years. The judge had given primary custody to Carmen, allowing James visitation on Wednesday evenings and weekends. James was outraged by the judge’s decision, as he was certain he was the better parent. James was convinced that Carmen was out to get him and destroy his relationship with his daughter. He’d recently informed Carmen that he was planning a whale-watching excursion for his daughter. When the trip neared, however, his daughter informed him that her mother had taken her whale watching the week prior. James was infuriated. He felt like Carmen was always trying to upstage him or win their daughter’s favor by throwing her the biggest birthday parties, buying her the most expensive Christmas gifts, and taking her on the most lavish vacations. James couldn’t afford to keep up with his ex-wife financially nor did he want to compete with her lack of discipline. Carmen allowed their daughter to stay up late, play outside alone, and eat as much junk food as she wanted. He tried to talk to Carmen about his concerns many times, but she made it clear she wasn’t interested in his opinion. James was pretty sure Carmen just wanted him to look like the bad guy in the eyes of their daughter. He also didn’t like the fact that his ex-wife was dating again because he worried about the type of men their daughter would be exposed to. He even told Carmen that he saw her boyfriend with another woman once, in the hopes that they would break up. His plan backfired when she threatened to get a restraining order against him if he didn’t leave her alone. James initially came to therapy not because he wanted help dealing with his emotions, but because he was looking for a legal ally. He wanted me to write a letter to the court outlining the reasons why he should have full custody of his daughter. When I explained that I couldn’t do that, he initially said he didn’t think therapy could possibly be helpful. But, instead of leaving, he just kept talking. When I asked him how effective his previous attempts to change the judge’s mind had been, he acknowledged that the judge was pretty clear that the custody order was going to remain in place, whether he liked it or not. He also admitted he hadn’t been able to convince Carmen to make any changes, despite his intense efforts. By the end of the session, James actually agreed to come to another appointment. During his next appointment, we discussed how his attempts to control the situation were negatively affecting his daughter. He recognized how his anger toward his ex-wife interfered with his relationship with his little girl. We discussed some strategies that could help him refocus some of his efforts on improving his relationship with his daughter instead. By the time James returned for his third and final session I knew he got it when he said, “I should have focused on having fun with my daughter when we went whale watching, rather than spending the entire trip texting angry messages to her mother about how I didn’t appreciate her attempts to overshadow me.” He also recognized that although he didn’t agree with some of Carmen’s rules, dragging her back to court repeatedly wasn’t likely to help resolve the situation. Instead, he’d only be wasting more money that he could be spending on their daughter. He decided that he should focus his energy on being the best role model he could be for their daughter, so he could be a positive influence in her life. KEEPING EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL It feels so safe to have everything under control, but thinking we have the power to always pull the strings can become problematic. Do you respond positively to any of these points below? You spend a lot of time and energy trying to prevent anything bad from happening. You invest energy into wishing other people would change. When faced with a tough situation, you think you can single-handedly fix everything. You believe the outcome of any situation is entirely based on how much effort you choose to exert. You assume that good luck has nothing to do with success. Instead, it’s completely up to you to determine your future. Other people sometimes accuse you of being a “control freak.” You struggle to delegate tasks to other people because you don’t think they’ll do the job right. Even when you recognize you aren’t able to completely control a situation, you struggle to let it go. If you fail at something, you believe you are solely responsible. You don’t feel comfortable asking for help. You think people who don’t reach their goals are completely responsible for their situation. You struggle with teamwork because you doubt the abilities of other people on the team. You have difficulty establishing meaningful relationships because you don’t trust people. Are you guilty of any of the examples above? We can’t possibly make all our circumstances and all the people in our lives fit into the way we think things should be. When you learn to let go of the details you can’t control, the amount of time and energy you’ll be able to devote to the things you can control will give you the ability to accomplish incredible feats. WHY WE TRY TO CONTROL EVERYTHING James felt very guilty about the divorce. He had tried to make his marriage work with Carmen, because he wanted their daughter to grow up in a stable home. When their relationship ended, he didn’t want their daughter to suffer. Clearly, James was a loving father who worried about his daughter’s well-being. It was terrifying for him to recognize how little control he had over what happened to his daughter when she was with her mother. To reduce his anxiety, he tried to control as much of the situation as he could. He thought that if he were able to control everything—from who his ex-wife dated to the type of rules she had in her home—he would feel better. Trying to control everything usually starts out as a way to manage anxiety. If you know you have everything under control, what’s there to worry about? Rather than focusing on managing your anxiety, you try controlling your environment. The desire to fix everything can also stem from a sort of superhero complex. We hold on to the mistaken belief that if we just try hard enough, everything will turn out the way we want. Rather than delegating a task to a coworker, or trusting a spouse to run an errand, we often choose to do it ourselves to make sure it will be “done right” because we don’t trust in other people’s capabilities. LOCUS OF CONTROL Deciding what is within your control and what isn’t depends largely upon your belief system. The psychology field refers to this as your locus of control. People with an external locus of control believe that their lives depend highly on fate, luck, or destiny. They’re more likely to believe “Whatever’s meant to be will be.” People with an internal locus of control believe they have complete control over their future. They take full responsibility for their successes and failures in life. They believe they have the ability to control everything from their financial future to their health. Your locus of control will determine how you view your circumstances. Imagine a person who attends a job interview. He possesses the qualifications, education, and experience the company is looking for. But a few days after the interview, he receives a call telling him he didn’t get the job. If he has an external locus of control he’ll think, They probably had some overqualified people apply for the position. It wasn’t the right job for me anyway. If he has an internal locus of control, he’s more likely to think, I must not have done a good job impressing them. I knew I should have redone my résumé. I’ve also got to sharpen my interview skills. Several factors influence your locus of control. Your childhood experiences certainly play a role. If you grew up in a family where hard work was valued, you may lean more toward an internal locus of control, because you’ll believe that hard work can pay off. If however, you grew up with parents who drilled into you things such as, “Your vote doesn’t matter in this world,” or “No matter what you do, the world will always keep you down,” you may have developed an external locus of control. Your experiences throughout life can also influence your locus of control. If you achieve success when you try hard, you’ll see that you have a lot of control over the outcome. But if you feel like no matter what you do, things just don’t turn out right, you may begin to feel like you have less control. An internal locus of control has often been idealized as the “best” way to be. Ideas like “You can do anything if you just put your mind to it” have been valued in many cultures. In fact, people with a high sense of control often make great CEOs because they believe in their ability to make a difference. Doctors like having patients with a strong internal locus of control because they do everything possible to treat and prevent illness. But there are also potential downsides to believing you can control everything. THE PROBLEM WITH WASTING ENERGY ON THINGS YOU CAN’T CONTROL James wasted a lot of time, energy, and money on trying to change his custody situation even though his repeated court appearances clearly weren’t influencing the judge’s decision. Although he initially thought that exerting more effort into controlling the situation would reduce his stress, over the long term, his stress increased each time he failed at his attempts to gain more control. His attempts to gain control also negatively impacted his relationship with his daughter. Instead of enjoying their time together and focusing on nurturing their relationship, he grilled her with questions to learn more about what was going on at her mother’s house. There are several problems associated with trying to control everything: • Trying to maintain complete control leads to increased anxiety. Efforts to manage your anxiety by trying to control everything in your environment will backfire. The more unsuccessful your attempts to control the situation are, the more anxious you’ll become. It can lead to feelings of inadequacy as you see that you aren’t able to fully control the outcome. • Attempting to control everything wastes time and energy. Worrying about things outside of your control wastes mental energy. Wishing circumstances were different, trying to convince people they have to do everything your way, and attempting to prevent anything bad from ever happening is exhausting. It takes energy away from actively problem solving and the issues you do have control over. • Being a control freak damages relationships. Telling people what they should do or how to do things right isn’t likely to attract many friends. In fact, many who have control issues struggle to get close to people because they don’t trust others with any type of responsibility. • You’ll judge others harshly. If you credit all your success in life to your abilities, you’ll criticize people who haven’t achieved the same. In fact, people with a high internal locus of control tend to suffer from loneliness because they feel irritable that other people aren’t keeping up with their standards. • You’ll unnecessarily blame yourself for everything. You can’t prevent bad things from happening all the time. But, if you think everything is within your control, you’ll believe you’re directly responsible every time life doesn’t go according to your plan. DEVELOP A BALANCED SENSE OF CONTROL James couldn’t move forward until he accepted that he didn’t have complete control over the custody situation. Once he was able to recognize this, he could focus on the things he did have control over—like improving his relationship with his daughter. He also wanted to focus on establishing at least a civil relationship with his ex-wife, but to do that, he needed to continue reminding himself that he couldn’t control what went on in her home. Clearly, if he recognized any signs that his daughter was being seriously harmed, he could act, but eating ice cream and staying up late didn’t rise to the level of danger that would make a judge give him custody. Those who strike the right balance of control recognize how their behaviors can affect their chances of success, but they also identify how external factors, such as being in the right place at the right time, can play a role. Researchers found that these people have a bi-locus of control, as opposed to a complete internal or external locus of control. To achieve this balance in your own life, be willing to examine your beliefs about what you truly can control and what you can’t. Take notice of times when you’ve devoted too much energy to people and circumstances that you just couldn’t change. Remind yourself that there’s a lot you can’t control: • You can host a good party, but you can’t control whether people have fun. • You can give your child tools to be successful, but you can’t make your child be a good student. • You can do your best at your job, but you can’t force your boss to recognize your work. • You can sell a great product, but you can’t dictate who buys it. • You may be the smartest person in the room, but you can’t control whether people choose to follow your advice. • You can nag, beg, and make threats, but you can’t force your spouse to behave differently. • You can have the most positive attitude in the world, but it can’t make a terminal diagnosis disappear. • You can control how much you take care of yourself, but you can’t always prevent illness. • You can control what you’re doing, but you can’t control your competitor. IDENTIFY YOUR FEARS In 2005, Heather Von St. James was diagnosed with mesothelioma when her daughter was just three months old. As a little girl, she had worn her father’s construction jacket for fun. His jacket had most likely been exposed to asbestos, which has been linked to mesothelioma and could explain why at only thirty-six, Heather had what is known as an “old man’s disease.” Doctors initially gave Heather fifteen months to live. With radiation and chemotherapy, they said she might live up to five years. She was, however, a prime candidate for lung removal, and although the surgery was risky, it was her best chance for survival. Heather chose to undergo the extensive surgery that would remove the affected lung and the lining around her lung as well as replace half of her diaphragm and the lining of her heart with surgical Gore-Tex. She remained hospitalized for a month following the operation. When she was discharged from the hospital, she went to stay with her parents for a few months so they could help her care for her baby while her husband returned to work. When Heather returned home three months later, she underwent radiation and chemotherapy. It took her almost a year to begin feeling better again, but to this day, she remains cancer free. Although she becomes out of breath more easily with physical exertion now that she only has one lung, she considers it a relatively small price to pay. To commemorate the anniversary of the day she got her lung removed, Heather now celebrates, “Lung Leavin’ Day” on February 2 each year. Each year on “Lung Leavin’ Day,” Heather acknowledges her fears about the things she doesn’t have control over—like the possibility of the cancer returning. She uses a marker to write those fears on a plate and then she symbolically lets go of those fears by smashing the plate into a fire. Within just a few short years, the celebration has grown. Today, more than eighty friends and family attend. Guests join in by writing down their own fears and smashing their plates into the fire. They’ve even turned it into a fund-raiser for mesothelioma research. “Cancer leaves you feeling so out of control,” Heather acknowledges. Although she is currently cancer free, she admits that she continues to be fearful that her daughter may have to grow up without a mother. But she chooses to face her fears head-on by writing down what scares her most, and recognizing that those things are not within her control. She then chooses to focus her efforts on what she does have control over—like living every day to the fullest. Heather now works as a patient advocate for mesothelioma. She speaks with newly diagnosed patients and helps them deal with their fears about cancer. She’s also a keynote speaker who delivers her message of hope and healing. When you notice yourself trying to control something that you can’t, ask yourself, What am I so afraid of? Do you worry someone else is going to make a bad choice? Do you worry that something is going to go terribly wrong? Are you terrified that you won’t be successful? Acknowledging your fears, and developing an understanding of them, will help you begin to recognize what is within your control and what isn’t. FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL Once you’ve identified your fears, identify what you can control, bearing in mind that sometimes the only thing you can control is your behavior and attitude. You can’t control what happens to your luggage once you hand it to an airline employee at the airport. But what you can control is what you pack in your carry-on bag. If you have your most important belongings and an extra change of clothing with you, it won’t feel like such an emergency if your luggage doesn’t arrive at your destination on time. By focusing on what you can control, it is much easier to let go of worrying about what you can’t. When you notice you have a lot of anxiety about a situation, do what you can to manage your reaction and influence the outcome. But recognize that you can’t control other people, and you can’t ever have complete control over the end result. INFLUENCE PEOPLE WITHOUT TRYING TO CONTROL THEM Jenny was twenty years old when she chose to drop out of college. After spending a couple of years working toward a degree in education, she decided she didn’t really want to be a math teacher. To her mother’s horror, she wanted to pursue art instead. Every day Jenny’s mother called to tell Jenny she was ruining her life. She made it clear she would never support Jenny’s choice to drop out of school. She even threatened to cut off contact with Jenny if she didn’t choose to take “the right path.” Jenny quickly got sick of her mother’s daily criticisms over her choices. She told her mother several times that she was not going back to college and her insults and threats wouldn’t change her mind. But her mother persisted because she worried about what type of future Jenny would have as an artist. Eventually, Jenny stopped answering the phone. She stopped going to her mother’s house for dinner, too. After all, it wasn’t enjoyable to hear her mother lecture her about how college dropouts and aspiring artists don’t ever make it in the real world. Even though Jenny was a grown adult, her mother wanted to control what she did. It was painful for her to sit on the sidelines and watch Jenny make choices she felt were irresponsible. She imagined her daughter would always be broke, unhappy, and struggling just to survive. Jenny’s mother mistakenly believed she could control what Jenny did with her life. Unfortunately, her attempts to control Jenny ruined their relationship without motivating Jenny to do anything different. It’s hard to sit back and watch other people engage in behavior we don’t approve of, especially if that behavior is something we view as self-destructive. But making demands, nagging, and begging won’t yield the results you want. Here are strategies to influence others without trying to force them to change: • Listen first, speak second. Other people are often less defensive when they feel like you’ve taken the time to hear what they have to say. • Share your opinion and concerns, but only share it once. Repeating your unease over and over again won’t make your words any more effective. In fact, it can backfire. • Change your behavior. If a wife doesn’t want her husband to drink, emptying his beer cans down the drain isn’t going to motivate him to stop drinking. But she can choose to spend time with him when he’s sober and not be around him when he’s drinking. If he enjoys spending time with her, he may choose to remain sober more often. • Point out the positive. If someone is making a genuine effort to create change, whether it’s to stop smoking or start exercising, offer some genuine praise. Just don’t go overboard or say something like, “See, I told you that you’d feel better if you quit eating all that junk food.” Backhanded compliments or an “I told you so” don’t motivate people to change. PRACTICE ACCEPTANCE Imagine a man stuck in a traffic jam. Traffic hasn’t moved an inch for twenty minutes and he’s running late for a meeting. He starts yelling, swearing, and banging his fists on the steering wheel. He wants so much to be in control that he just can’t tolerate the fact that he’s going to be late. These people should just get out of my way, he thinks. It’s ridiculous that there’s this much traffic in the middle of the afternoon. Contrast that person with someone in the car next to him who turns on the radio and chooses to sing along to some of his favorite tunes while he waits. He figures, I’ll get there when I can. He uses his time and energy wisely because he knows he has no control over when traffic will start moving again. Instead, he tells himself, There are millions of cars on the road every day. Sometimes traffic jams are bound to happen. Either of these people could choose to do something different in the future to avoid traffic. They could leave earlier, take a different route, use public transportation, check the traffic report ahead of time, or even start a movement to try and change the road systems. But, for now, they have the choice to accept that they’re stuck in a traffic jam or focus on the fact that they feel an injustice is being done. Even though you might not like the situation you’re in, you can choose to accept it. You can accept that your boss is mean, that your mother doesn’t approve of you, or that your kids aren’t striving to be high achievers. That doesn’t mean you can’t work toward influencing them by changing your behavior, but it does mean you can stop trying to force them to be different. GIVING UP CONTROL WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER At the age of eighteen, Terry Fox was diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Doctors amputated his leg but warned him that his survival rate was only 50 percent. They also made it clear that major advances had been made in cancer treatment over the past few years. Just two years previously, the survival rate for this type of cancer was only 15 percent. Within three weeks of his surgery, Fox was walking with the help of a prosthetic limb. His doctors noted that his positive attitude most likely had something to do with his rapid recovery. He underwent sixteen months of chemotherapy and during that time, he met many other patients who were dying from cancer. By the time his treatment ended, he decided to spread the word about the need for more funding for cancer research. On the night before he got his leg amputated, he’d read a story about a man who had run the New York City marathon with a prosthetic leg. The article inspired him to begin running as soon as he was physically able. He ran his first marathon in British Columbia, and though he finished in last place, he was met with a lot of support at the finish line. After completing the marathon, Fox hatched a fund-raising plan. He decided to run across Canada by completing a marathon every single day. Initially, he hoped to earn a million dollars for charity, but he soon set his sights even higher. He wanted to raise one dollar for each person in Canada—a grand total of 24 million. In April of 1980, he set out to run over twenty-six miles a day. As word of his trek began to spread, his support increased. Communities began holding large receptions to commemorate his arrival in their town. He was asked to give speeches, and the amount of money he raised increased. Fox ran for an amazing 143 days straight. But his run came to an end one day when he couldn’t catch his breath and he began experiencing chest pain. He was taken to the hospital and doctors confirmed that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. After running over three thousand miles, he was forced to stop. His journey had raised over 1.7 million by the time he was hospitalized. But as the news of his hospitalization circulated, he gained even more support. A five-hour telethon raised 10.5 million. Donations continued and by the next spring, Fox had raised over 23 million. Although he attempted a variety of treatments, his cancer continued to spread, and in June of 1981, Fox died from complications of his cancer. Fox understood he couldn’t control every aspect of his health. He couldn’t stop people from getting cancer. He couldn’t even control the spread of the disease in his own body. Instead of focusing on those things, he chose to put his energy into the things he could control. In his letter requesting support prior to his run, Fox made it clear he didn’t think his run would cure cancer, but he knew it would make a difference. “The running thing I can do, even if I have to crawl every last mile,” he said. His choice to do something that seemed unimaginable gave him a purpose that continues today. Each year, countries all over the world participate in the Terry Fox run. Over 650 million has been raised in his honor. When you stop trying to control every aspect of your life, you’ll have more time and energy to devote to things you can control. Here are some of the benefits you’ll experience: • Increased happiness—The maximum level of happiness is achieved when people have a balanced locus of control. Coined as a “bi-local expectancy,” the people who understand that they can take a lot of steps to control their lives while also recognizing the limitations of their ability are happier than people who think they can control everything. • Better relationships—When you give up your need for control, you’ll likely experience better relationships. You’ll have fewer trust issues and you’ll welcome more people into your life. You may be more willing to ask for help, and other people are likely to view you as less critical. Research indicates that people who stop trying to control everything experience an increased sense of belonging and community. • Less stress—When you stop carrying around the weight of the world, you’ll feel less stressed. You may experience more short-term anxiety as you give up control, but over the long term, you’ll have a lot less stress and anxiety. • New opportunities—When you have a strong need to control things, you’ll be less likely to invite change into your life because there aren’t any guarantees of a positive outcome. When you choose to give up your need to control everything, you’ll have increased confidence in your ability to handle new opportunities. • More success—Although most people who want to control everything have a deep desire to be successful, having an internal locus of control can actually interfere with your chances of success. Research shows that it’s possible to become so focused on ensuring you’ll be successful, you could actually overlook opportunities that could help you advance. When you give up your desire to control everything, you’ll be more willing to look around and you may recognize good fortune that comes your way even if it isn’t directly related to your behavior. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS When you focus on what’s wrong with the world, without looking at how you can control your attitude and behavior, you’ll find yourself stuck. Instead of wasting energy trying to prevent a storm, focus on how you can prepare for it. WHAT’S HELPFUL Delegating tasks and responsibilities to other people Asking for help when you need it Focusing on solving problems that are within your control Keeping the emphasis on influencing others rather than controlling them Thinking balanced thoughts about what is within your control and what isn’t Not relying on yourself for the entire outcome WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Insisting on doing everything because no one else can do it right Choosing to do everything on your own because you think you should be able to accomplish things without help Spending time trying to figure out how to change things that are likely beyond your direct control Trying to force other people to do what you think they should do, regardless of how they feel Only thinking about what you can do to make things turn out the way you want Taking full responsibility for the end result without acknowledging other factors that influence the outcome OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 5 THEY DON’T WORRY ABOUT PLEASING EVERYONE Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner. —LAO TZU Megan entered my therapy office looking for help because she was feeling stressed out and overwhelmed. She said there weren’t enough hours in the day to accomplish everything she needed to do. At age thirty-five, she was married and had two young children. She worked a part-time job, taught Sunday school, and was the Girl Scout troop leader. She strived to be a good wife and mother, but she felt like she just wasn’t doing a good enough job. She was often irritable and grumpy toward her family and she wasn’t sure why. The more Megan talked, the clearer it became that she was a woman who couldn’t say no. Church members frequently called her on Saturday nights, asking her to bake muffins for Sunday morning’s church service. Parents of her Girl Scout troop sometimes relied on her to drive their children home if they were stuck at work. Megan also frequently babysat for her sister’s kids, so her sister wouldn’t have to spend money on a sitter. She also had a cousin who sought favors and always seemed to have some sort of last-minute problem, ranging from being short on cash to needing help with a home improvement project. Lately, Megan had stopped answering her cousin’s phone calls because she knew that every time she called she needed something. Megan said to me that her number one rule was to never say no to family. So each time her cousin asked for a favor or her sister asked her to babysit, she automatically said yes. When I asked her what impact that had on her husband and children, she told me that sometimes it meant she wasn’t home in time for dinner or to put the kids to bed. Just admitting that out loud helped Megan begin to realize why saying yes to extended family meant she was saying no to her immediate family. Although she valued her extended family, her husband and her children were her top priorities, and she decided she needed to start treating them accordingly. We also reviewed her desire to be liked by everyone. Her biggest fear was that other people would think she was selfish. However, after a few therapy sessions she began to recognize that her need to always be liked was actually much more selfish than saying no to someone. Helping others really wasn’t about improving their lives; she was mostly giving of herself because she wanted to be held in higher regard. Once she changed the way she thought about people pleasing, she was able to begin changing her behavior. It took some practice for Megan to begin saying no to people. In fact, she wasn’t even sure how to say no. She thought she needed an excuse but she didn’t want to lie. But I encouraged her to simply say something like “No, I’m not able to do that,” without providing a lengthy reason why. She began practicing saying no and she found that the more she did it, the easier it became. Although she had imagined people would become angry with her, she quickly noticed that they didn’t really seem to mind. The more time she spent with her family, the less irritable she felt. Her stress level also decreased and after saying no a few times, she felt less pressured to please others. PEOPLE-PLEASING SIGNS While in chapter 2 we discussed how giving away your power is about allowing people to control how you feel; people pleasing is about trying to control how other people feel. Do you respond positively to any of the points below? You feel responsible for how other people feel. The thought of anyone being mad at you causes you to feel uncomfortable. You tend to be a “pushover.” You find it easier to agree with people rather than express a contrary opinion. You often apologize even when you don’t think you did anything wrong. You go to great lengths to avoid conflict. You don’t usually tell people when you’re feeling offended or your feelings are hurt. You tend to say yes when people ask you for favors, even if you really don’t want to do something. You change your behavior based on what you think other people want. You put a lot of energy into trying to impress people. If you hosted a party and people didn’t seem to be enjoying themselves, you’d feel responsible. You seek praise and approval from people in your life often. When someone around you is upset, you take responsibility for trying to make him or her feel better. You would never want anyone to think you are selfish. You often feel overscheduled and overburdened by all the things you have to do. Do any of those examples sound familiar? Attempts to be a “nice person” can backfire when your behavior crosses over into people pleasing. It can take a serious toll on all areas of your life and make it impossible to reach your goals. You can still be a kind and generous person without trying to please everyone. WHY WE TRY TO PLEASE PEOPLE Megan strived to develop a reputation as someone who could always meet other people’s needs. Her self-worth was fueled by the way other people seemed to perceive her. She went to such great lengths to make others happy because in her mind the alternatives—finding herself in the midst of conflict, feeling rejected, or losing relationships—were much worse than the emotional and physical exhaustion she felt. FEAR Conflict and confrontation can be uncomfortable. It’s usually not enjoyable to sit between squabbling coworkers in a meeting. And who wants to attend a family holiday gathering when their relatives are arguing? Fearing conflict, we tell ourselves, If I can make everyone happy, everything will be okay. When a people pleaser sees a car approaching quickly, he may drive faster because he thinks, That guy is in a hurry. I don’t want to make him mad by going too slow. People pleasers may also fear rejection or abandonment. If I don’t make you happy, you won’t like me. They thrive on praise and reassurance from others, and if they’re not receiving enough positive reinforcement, they change their behavior to try and make people feel happy. LEARNED BEHAVIOR Sometimes the desire to avoid conflict stems from childhood. If you were raised by parents who were constantly bickering, you may have learned that conflict is bad and keeping people happy is the best way to prevent arguments. Children of alcoholics, for example, often grow up to be people pleasers because that was the best way to deal with a parent’s unpredictable behavior. In other cases, doing good deeds was the only way to get any attention. Putting other people first can also become a way to feel needed and important. I’m worth something if I can make other people feel happy. So it becomes a habit to always invest energy into other people’s feelings and lives. A lot of my clients will often tell me they need to behave like a doormat, because that’s what the Bible says they should do. But I’m pretty sure the Bible says to “treat your neighbor as yourself,” not better than yourself. Most spiritual guidance encourages us to be bold enough to live according to our values, even when doing so displeases some people. THE PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE PLEASING Megan’s desire to please others made her lose sight of her values. She wasn’t getting her needs met and it impacted her mood. She realized exactly how much her increased attempts to please others had affected her family when—after a few therapy sessions—her husband said to her, “I feel like I’ve got my old Megan back.” YOUR ASSUMPTIONS AREN’T ALWAYS TRUE Sally invites Jane to go shopping with her. The only reason Sally invites Jane is because Jane asked her out for coffee last week and Sally thinks it would be nice to reciprocate. However, Sally actually hopes Jane declines because she wants to make it a quick trip to the mall to pick out some shoes. She knows if Jane goes, she’ll likely want to shop for hours. Jane actually doesn’t want to go shopping. She has some errands to run and a few household chores to finish up. But she doesn’t want to hurt Sally’s feelings. So when Sally invites her to the mall, she agrees to go. Both of these women think they’re doing something that pleases the other person. However, they clearly have no idea what the other person wants. Their “attempts to be nice” are actually causing more of a nuisance to each other. But neither one has the courage to actually speak up and say what she really wants. Most of us wrongly assume that people-pleasing behavior proves we’re generous. But when you think about it, always trying to please people isn’t a selfless act. It’s actually quite self-centered. It assumes that everyone cares about your every move. It also assumes you think you have the power to control how other people feel. If you’re constantly doing things to make others happy and you don’t think they are appreciative of your efforts, you’ll soon experience resentment. Thoughts such as I do so much for you, but you don’t do anything for me will creep in and ultimately hurt your relationships. PEOPLE PLEASING DAMAGES RELATIONSHIPS Angela didn’t try to please everyone in her life, just the men she dated. If she was on a date with a man who said he liked women with a sense of humor, she’d make a few extra jokes. If she was on a date with a man who said he liked spontaneous women, she’d tell him all about the last-minute trip to France she took last summer. If, however, another man said he liked smart women, she’d talk about that same trip to France but this time she’d say she went because she wanted to view fine art. Angela did whatever she could to try to make herself appear more attractive to whomever she was dating. She felt that if she said enough things that were pleasing to her date, she’d get to go on a second date. She didn’t think about the long-term consequences of her ever-changing personality. Eventually, she wasn’t able to please anyone quite enough to stay with her for the long haul. No respectable man wanted to date a shell of a woman who behaved like a puppet. In fact, a lot of her dates got annoyed fairly quickly by Angela because she constantly agreed with everything they said. Her attempts to say whatever they wanted to hear were usually pretty transparent. Angela feared that if she disagreed with a date or held an opposing opinion, he would no longer be interested in her, which reveals her lack of trust. You won’t keep me around unless I do what you want, she thought. If you truly care about someone and you believe the person cares about you, you’d have to be willing to tell that individual the truth. You recognize that even if that person doesn’t like something you say or do, he or she can still enjoy your company. It’s an impossible feat to always make everyone around you happy. Perhaps your father-in-law asks you to help him on a project. But if you leave to go help him, your spouse will get angry because you had already made plans to have lunch together. When faced with such a decision, people pleasers will often choose to risk not pleasing the person closest to them. They know that their spouse will eventually get over being offended. Unfortunately, this leaves the people you love the most feeling hurt or angry. Shouldn’t we do the opposite? Shouldn’t we work the hardest on the most intimate and special relationships? Ever met someone who behaves like a martyr? Such individuals’ attempts to please others actually becomes a turnoff. They’re constantly saying things like “I do everything around here” or “If I don’t do it, no one will.” Martyrs risk becoming angry, bitter people, as their attempts to make others happy backfire. Whether you’re guilty of thinking you’re a martyr, or you simply struggle to say no when you fear you’ll hurt someone’s feelings, there aren’t any guarantees people will like you just because you try to please them. Instead, they may simply start taking advantage of you without forming a deeper relationship based on trust and mutual respect. PEOPLE PLEASERS LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR VALUES Bronnie Ware, an Australian nurse who spent many years working with patients who were dying, cites people pleasing as one of the biggest regrets she heard her patients share on their deathbeds. In her book, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, she explains how dying people often said they wished they had lived a more authentic life. Instead of dressing, acting, and speaking in a manner that was pleasing to others, they’d wished they’d been true to themselves. There’s even research published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology that shows people pleasers in a study tended to eat more when they thought it would make others around them happier. They were willing to sabotage their own health if they thought it would help the other people in the room even though they had no evidence that the people around them were even paying attention to what they were eating. Pleasing people will hold you back from reaching your full potential. Although people pleasers want to be liked, they often don’t want to be the best at anything because they fear being held in too high regard could make other people feel bad. Someone may not get that promotion at work because he doesn’t feel comfortable taking credit for the work he’s done. Or a woman who gets approached by an attractive man may choose not to reciprocate friendly conversation because she doesn’t want to make her friend feel bad that he didn’t start talking to her first. No matter what your values are, you’ll stop behaving according to them if you’re focused primarily on pleasing other people. You’ll quickly lose sight of doing what’s right and try only to do what makes other people happy. Just because it’s a popular choice doesn’t mean it’s the right choice. AVOID PEOPLE PLEASING Saying yes had become such a habit for Megan that she found herself agreeing to do things automatically. So I helped her to develop a mantra where she repeated to herself, “Saying yes to others means saying no to my husband and kids.” She knew it was okay to say yes to some things without her husband and children being negatively affected. She just couldn’t say yes all the time or her mood and family would suffer. DETERMINE WHO YOU WANT TO PLEASE If you want to be successful at reaching your goals, you need to define your path, not just do what other people want you to do. Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster knows the importance of this firsthand. Buckmaster became the CEO of Craigslist in 2000. While other websites were capitalizing on advertising, Craigslist wasn’t. In fact, Craigslist turned down a variety of revenue-generating opportunities. Instead, Buckmaster and the team decided to keep the website simple, and only charge users for a very few specific types of listings. The bulk of user-generated listings has remained a free service. In fact, the company doesn’t even have a marketing team. Craigslist received a lot of backlash for this decision and Buckmaster has been the target of much criticism. He’s been accused of being anticapitalistic and even called a “social anarchist.” But Buckmaster didn’t try to please his critics. Instead, he continued running Craigslist the way it has always operated. His willingness to go against the grain and prevent Craigslist from depending too heavily on advertisements has likely kept the business running. It survived the dot-com crash with ease and continues to be one of the most popular websites in the world. Craigslist has been estimated to be worth at least 5 billion. By not worrying about trying to please everyone, Buckmaster was able to keep the company focused on serving its purpose and reaching its audience. Before you automatically change your behavior based on what you think other people want, evaluate your thoughts and feelings. When you second-guess whether you should express your opinion, remember these truths about people pleasing: • Worrying about trying to please everyone is a waste of time. You can’t control how other people feel and the more time you spend devoting your thoughts to wondering if people will be happy, the less time you’ll have to think about what really matters. • People pleasers are easily manipulated. Others can recognize a people pleaser a mile away. Manipulators often use tactics to prey on people pleasers’ emotions and control their behavior. Be on the lookout for people who say things like “I’m only asking you to do to this because you’d do the best job” or “I hate to ask you this, but . . .” • It’s okay for other people to feel angry or disappointed. There is no reason that people need to feel happy or pleased all the time. Everyone has the ability to cope with a wide array of feelings, and it’s not your job to prevent them from feeling negative emotions. Just because someone gets mad, it doesn’t necessarily mean you did anything wrong. • You can’t please everyone. It’s impossible for everyone to be delighted by the same things. Accept that some people will just never be pleased, and it isn’t your job to make them happy. CLARIFY YOUR VALUES Imagine a single mother who works a full-time job at a factory. One day, when she wakes her son up for school, he says he doesn’t feel well. She checks his temperature and he has a slight fever. Clearly, he can’t go to school. She has to decide what to do with him for the day. She doesn’t have any friends or family members who can stay with him. She could call in sick to her job, but she won’t get paid if she takes the day off. If she doesn’t get paid for the day, she’ll struggle to afford groceries for the week. She also worries that missing another day of work could put her job at risk. She’s already missed a lot of days due to the children being sick. She decides to leave her son home alone for the day. She knows other people will likely have a negative opinion about her choice to leave a sick child home alone when he’s only ten years old. However, her values tell her it’s the right choice given her circumstances, regardless of how others may judge her. It’s not that she values her job more than her son. In fact, she values her family more than anything. But she knows that going to work is best for the greater good of her family in the long run. When you’re faced with decisions in your life, it’s important to know exactly what your values are so you can make the best choices. Could you easily list your top five values off the top of your head? Most people can’t. But if you aren’t really clear on your values, how do you know where to put your energy, and how to make the best decisions? Taking time to clarify your values can be a very worthwhile exercise. Common values include: • Children • Romantic relationship • Extended family • Religious/Spiritual beliefs • Volunteering or helping other people • Career • Money • Maintaining good friendships • Taking care of your physical health • Having a sense of purpose • Leisure activities • Pleasing people • Education Pick your top five values in life and rank them in order from most important to least important. Now stop and think about whether you are actually living according to those values. How much of your time, money, energy, and skill is devoted to each one? Are you putting too much effort into something that’s not even on your list? Where on your list does pleasing people fall? It should never be at the top. Reviewing the order of your list from time to time can help you determine if your life is out of balance. TAKE TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SAY YES OR NO In the case of Megan, she avoided her cousin because she knew she couldn’t say no if she was asked to do a favor. To help her say no, we developed a script. Whenever anyone asked her to do something, she responded by saying, “Let me see what I have going on and I’ll get back to you.” That bought her some time to really think about whether she wanted to do something. Then, she could ensure that if she said yes it was because she wanted to, not simply because she wanted to please others at her own expense. If automatically saying yes has become a habit in your life, learn how to evaluate your decision before giving an answer. When someone asks you to do something, ask yourself these questions before responding: • Is this something I want to do? Most people pleasers don’t even know what they want because they’re so used to doing things automatically. Take a moment to evaluate your opinion. • What will I have to give up by doing this? If you do something for someone else, you’ll have to give something up. Maybe it’s time with your family or perhaps it will cost you money. Before making a decision, recognize what saying yes will mean for you. • What will I gain by doing this? Maybe it will give you an opportunity to improve your relationship, or maybe doing something like this will likely be something you enjoy. Think about the potential benefits of saying yes. • How will I feel if I do it? Are you likely to feel angry and resentful? Or will you feel happy and proud? Take some time to imagine how you’re likely to feel as you weigh your options. Like Megan discovered, you don’t need to have an excuse about why you can’t do something. When you say no, you can say something such as “I wish I could but I’m not going to be able to do that” or “Sorry, but I won’t be able to.” If you’re not used to saying no, it can take some practice, but it gets easier with time. PRACTICE BEHAVING ASSERTIVELY Confrontation doesn’t have to be bad or scary. In fact, assertive discussions can actually be quite healthy and sharing your concerns can improve relationships. At one point, Megan confronted her cousin and told her that she felt like she had been taken advantage of in the past. Her cousin apologized, said she had no idea Megan ever felt like that and she wanted to make sure it wouldn’t happen again. Megan accepted some responsibility for her feelings and her behavior, since she didn’t speak up to say no when she was asked to do things she didn’t want to do. Megan and her cousin were able to repair their relationship instead of allowing it to dissolve. Speak up if someone takes advantage of you and ask for what you need. You don’t have to be demanding or rude, but instead, remain respectful and polite. Express your feelings and stick to the facts. Use “I” statements, such as “I’m frustrated that you’re always thirty minutes late,” instead of “You’re never on time.” I work with a lot of parents who can’t stand it when their children aren’t happy. They don’t want to tell their kids they can’t do something because they don’t want their kids to cry or accuse them of being mean. Whether it’s your children, a friend, a coworker, or even a stranger, sometimes it feels uncomfortable to know someone is angry at you if you’re not used to speaking up for yourself. But with practice, that discomfort becomes easier to tolerate and behaving assertively is easier to do. ACCEPTING THAT YOU CAN’T PLEASE EVERYONE MAKES YOU STRONGER Mose Gingerich struggled with a decision that most of us can’t imagine ever having to make. He was raised in an Amish community in Wisconsin where his days were spent plowing the fields and milking the cows by hand. But Mose wasn’t convinced he wanted to remain Amish. In a community where questions were discouraged, Mose questioned everything he’d been taught about God and the Amish way of life. He spent years wrestling with the idea of leaving the Amish community. The Amish way of life was all he’d ever known. To permanently leave, he’d never again be allowed contact with anyone in the Amish community, including his mother and his siblings. Besides, stepping into the “English world” would be like entering a foreign land. Mose had never been allowed to use modern-day conveniences, like computers, or even electricity. How could he possibly make it on his own in the outside world that he didn’t know much about? Entering a relatively unknown world wasn’t the scariest part for Mose. Instead, he was most terrified that he’d go to hell. He’d always been warned that the Amish God was the only God, and to leave the Amish meant he’d be leaving God. The Amish elders told him that there was no hope for people in the outside world. Individuals who left the Amish, but tried to remain Christians, were only playing with fire. Mose temporarily left his Amish community a couple of times during his teenage and young adult years. He traveled around the country and learned about other Amish cultures and got a taste of the outside world. His explorations helped him to develop his own view of the world and of God. And ultimately, he decided his views weren’t in line with the Amish community’s beliefs. So Mose decided to leave his Amish life behind once and for all. Mose created a new life for himself in Missouri, where he’s experienced a variety of adventures ranging from opening his own construction business to starring in reality TV shows. He’s had to make his own way without any help from his family, because they, and all the other people in his former community, no longer speak to him. Mose sometimes mentors other ex-Amish young people as they struggle to integrate into the “English world” since Mose knows firsthand that finding a job, getting a driver’s license, and developing an understanding of cultural norms can be difficult without support. I had an opportunity to ask him how he made that decision and he told me that by confronting his own beliefs, he realized that “this world is what one makes of it, and that one makes what one chooses. And that those choices were mine. So I chose to leave, and I threw my lot in with the modern world. And every day that I wake up next to my wife, my two girls, and my stepson, I thank God that I did.” If Mose had focused on trying to please everyone, he’d still be living in the Amish community, even though he knew it wasn’t right for him. But Mose was strong enough to step away from everything he’d ever been taught, and everyone he’d ever known, to do what he felt was the right choice for him. He’s satisfied with the life that he’s built for himself, and he’s secure enough in who he is to tolerate the disapproval from the entire Amish community. Your words and your behavior must be in line with your beliefs before you can begin to enjoy a truly authentic life. When you stop worrying about pleasing everyone and, instead, are willing to be bold enough to live according to your own values, you’ll experience many benefits: • Your self-confidence will soar. The more you’re able to see that you don’t have to make people happy, the more independence and confidence you’ll gain. You’ll feel content with the decisions you make, even when other people disagree with your actions, because you’ll know you made the right choice. • You’ll have more time and energy to devote to your goals. Instead of wasting energy trying to become the person you think others want you to be, you’ll have time and energy to work on yourself. When you channel that effort toward your goals, you’ll be much more likely to be successful. • You’ll feel less stressed. When you set limits and healthy boundaries, you’ll experience a lot less stress and irritation. You’ll feel like you have more control over your life. • You’ll establish healthier relationships. Other people will develop more respect for you when you behave in an assertive manner. Your communication will improve and you’ll be able to prevent yourself from building a lot of anger and resentment toward people. • You’ll have increased willpower. An interesting 2008 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology showed that people have much more willpower when they’re making choices on their own accord rather than out of an attempt to please someone else. If you’re only doing something to make someone else happy, you’ll struggle to reach your goal. You’ll be motivated to keep up the good work if you’re convinced it’s the best choice for you. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS There may be certain areas of your life where it’s easy to behave according to your values, and there may be other areas where you find yourself worrying about pleasing people. Be aware of the warning signs and work on trying to live a life that lines up with your beliefs, not one that will make the most people happy. WHAT’S HELPFUL Identifying your values and behaving according to them Being aware of your emotions before deciding whether to say yes to someone’s request Saying no when you don’t want to do something Practicing tolerating uncomfortable emotions associated with conflict and confrontation Behaving assertively even when speaking up may not be well received WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Losing sight of who you are and what your values are Only considering someone else’s feelings without thinking about your emotions Automatically accepting an invitation without considering whether it’s a good choice Agreeing with people and complying with requests to avoid confrontation Going along with the crowd or refusing to express any opinions that may go against what the majority of people think OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 6 THEY DON’T FEAR TAKING CALCULATED RISKS Don’t be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON Dale had worked as a high school shop teacher for almost thirty years and although he liked his job, he just wasn’t all that passionate about it anymore. He dreamed about the flexibility, freedom, and money he could gain from opening his own furniture store. But when he’d shared that idea with his wife, she’d rolled her eyes and referred to him as a dreamer. The more Dale thought about it, the more he believed his wife was probably right. But he didn’t want to keep teaching shop class. Partially because he was bored with teaching and partially because he knew he was burned out. He felt like he wasn’t as effective at teaching as he used to be. He didn’t think it was fair to his students for him to keep teaching indefinitely. The dream of opening his own business certainly wasn’t the first big idea Dale had ever had. He’d once dreamed of living on a sailboat. During another phase of his life, he’d wanted to open a bed-and-breakfast in Hawaii. He’d never attempted to follow through with any of his ideas because he always felt like he should focus on providing for his family. Although his children were now grown, and he and his wife were doing okay financially, he figured he should just keep working at his teaching job until he reached retirement age. As Dale trudged on as a shop teacher, he struggled with his mood. He felt defeated and became depressed, something that he hadn’t experienced before. He sought counseling, because he felt like there must be something wrong since for the first time in his career, he really wasn’t enjoying his job. Although Dale told me he agreed with his wife that he shouldn’t venture into becoming an entrepreneur, it was clear that deep down he was still excited by the prospect. At the mere mention of opening his own furniture business, his face lit up, his body language changed, and his entire mood shifted. We discussed his past experiences with taking risks. He said that years ago, he had invested in real estate and lost a lot of money. Ever since then he was scared to take any type of financial risk. After a few therapy sessions, Dale confessed that he’d still love to start a business, but he was terrified at the thought of giving up a stable job. He was confident in his woodworking skills but lacked business knowledge. We began discussing steps he could take to educate himself about the business world. Dale said he’d welcome the opportunity to take business classes at the local community college. He also said he’d be happy to join a local business networking group and would even look for a mentor to help him get started. With a few ideas in mind about how he still may be able to keep his dream alive, Dale continued weighing the pros and cons of opening his own business. Within a few weeks, Dale made a decision—he would open his business on a part-time basis. He planned to start making furniture on nights and weekends in his garage. He already had much of what he would need to get the business started, but he would need to invest a little money for new materials. Overall, he felt confident he could start the business with relatively little investment cost. Initially he wouldn’t have a storefront—he’d sell his furniture online and through the newspaper. If there was a lot of interest in his furniture, he’d consider opening a storefront at a later date, and perhaps he’d even be able to quit his job as a teacher altogether. Dale’s mood showed marked improvement as soon as he began thinking about turning his dream into a reality. After a few more therapy sessions, Dale appeared to continue doing better as he worked toward his goals. We scheduled one further appointment a month down the road just to make sure his mood remained stable. When he returned, he told me something quite interesting—not only had he started to make furniture for his business, but he was actually enjoying teaching shop class more than he ever had before. He said that the prospect of opening his own business seemed to spark his passion for teaching shop again. He planned to continue building furniture part-time but was no longer convinced he wanted to quit teaching. Instead, he was excited to teach his students the new things he was learning from his furniture business. RISK AVERSION We face many risks in our lives—financial, physical, emotional, social, and business risks to name a few, but often people avoid taking the risks that could help them reach their full potential because they’re afraid. Do you respond positively to any of the points below? You struggle to make important decisions in your life. You spend a lot of time daydreaming about what you’d like to do, but you don’t take any action. Sometimes you impulsively make a decision because thinking about the decision is just too anxiety provoking. You often think you could be doing a lot more adventurous and exciting things in life, but your fear holds you back. When you think about taking a risk, you usually only imagine the worst-case scenario and choose not to take the chance. You sometimes allow other people to make decisions for you so you don’t have to make them. You avoid risks in at least some areas of your life—social, financial, or physical—because you’re afraid. You base decisions on your level of fear. If you’re a little afraid, you might do something. But, if you feel really afraid, you decide taking the risk is unwise. You think that outcomes are largely dependent on luck. A lack of knowledge about how to calculate risk leads to increased fear. And fearing risk often leads to avoidance. But there are steps you can take to increase your ability to calculate risk accurately, and with practice, your risk-taking skills can improve. WHY WE AVOID RISKS When Dale pictured himself opening a business, he was reminded of the last time he took a financial risk and it didn’t work out for him. His thoughts about taking another risk were immensely negative. He imagined himself becoming bankrupt or risking his entire retirement to open a business that would fail. His exaggeratedly negative thoughts led to fear and anxiety that prevented him from taking action. It never occurred to him to find ways to decrease his risk and increase his chances of success. EMOTION PREVAILS OVER LOGIC Even when our emotions lack any type of rational basis, we sometimes allow those feelings to prevail. Instead of thinking about “what could be . . .” we focus on “what if.” But risks don’t have to be reckless. My yellow Lab, Jet, is a pretty emotional guy. The way he feels completely dictates his behavior. And for some reason, he is terrified of some pretty strange things. For example, he’s scared of most types of flooring. He loves to walk around on carpet, but try to convince him to walk across linoleum, and you’ll likely be out of luck. He’s convinced himself that most floors are slippery and he’s terrified he might fall. Similar to how people often manage their anxiety, Jet created rules to manage his fears. He can walk across the hardwood flooring in my living room without a problem. But he won’t set foot on the tile in the hallway. He used to stand at the end of the hallway and whine for hours because he wanted to visit me in the office but didn’t want to risk stepping on the tile. I had hoped he’d ultimately decide visiting me was worth the risk, but he didn’t. Eventually, I created a path of throw rugs and now he carefully steps from rug to rug to avoid walking on the floor. He has rules about other houses that he occasionally visits. When he goes to Lincoln’s mother’s house, which also has tile, he proceeds to the living room by walking backward. In his canine mind, apparently it makes sense to back up, just not walk forward on her tile. My dad took care of Jet once while we were out of town and he sat on the welcome mat just inside the door for the entire weekend. Sometimes Jet won’t even enter certain buildings and has to be carried because he won’t set foot on the linoleum. It’s not a small feat to carry an eighty-pound dog into the vet’s office, so sometimes we bring our own throw rugs to create a path for him. Jet’s fear usually outweighs his desire to risk walking on certain floors, but there is an exception to the rule—when there’s cat food at stake, he’s willing to take the risk. Jet had never actually entered the kitchen before because of the tile floor. But as soon as he figured out there was an unattended cat food dish, his excitement outweighed his fear. Almost every day when he thinks we’re not watching, Jet slowly puts one paw into the kitchen. Soon, he’ll put two paws on the floor and stretch as far into the kitchen as he can. Eventually, he’ll get three paws on the floor. With one last paw still on the carpet, he’ll stretch as far as he can reach into the kitchen, and sometimes he manages to make it all the way to the cat food dish with all four paws safely on the tile. I don’t know how Jet draws conclusions about which floors are “safe” and which are “scary” simply by looking at them. Despite the lack of logic involved, it apparently makes sense to Jet. Although it sounds ridiculous, humans often calculate risk in much the same way. We base our decisions on emotion instead of logic. We incorrectly assume there’s a direct correlation between our fear level and the risk level. But often, our emotions are just not rational. If we truly understood how to calculate risk, we’d know which risks were worth taking and we’d be a lot less fearful about taking them. WE DON’T THINK ABOUT RISKS To calculate risk, we must predict the probability that the outcome of our behavior will result in either positive or negative consequences and then measure how big of an impact those consequences will have. Too often a risk evokes such a fear that we decide not to think about it or its consequences at all. And without understanding the potential outcomes of taking a risk, we usually end up avoiding risky ideas or dreams altogether. Risk starts out as a thought process. Whether you’re considering purchasing a new home, or you’re deciding whether to put on your seat belt, the decision involves some level of risk. Your thoughts about the risk will influence the way you feel, and ultimately, sway your behavior. When you’re driving your car, you decide how fast to go. You face safety and legal risks while driving on the road, and you must balance these risks with your time. The faster you drive, the less time you have to spend in the car, but driving faster will also increase your risk of getting in an accident and receiving legal consequences. It’s unlikely you spend much time thinking about how fast to drive on your way to work each day. Instead your decision to obey the law or break the speed limit weighs heavily on your usual routine. But if you’re running late one day, you’ll need to decide whether to drive faster and risk more physical and legal danger or risk being late for work. The truth is, most of us don’t really invest much time calculating which risks to take and which risks to avoid. Instead, we base our decisions on emotions or habit. If it sounds too scary, we avoid the risk. If we’re excited about the possible benefits, we’re more likely to overlook the risk. THE PROBLEM WITH FEARING RISK Once Dale’s children had all graduated from college, he wanted to do more exciting things with his life. When he thought about opening a business, however, he felt like he’d be jumping off a cliff without a safety harness. What Dale didn’t calculate was the emotional toll that avoiding risk was having on him. Not following his dream affected his mood because it changed the way he thought about himself and the way he felt about his teaching job. YOU DON’T GET TO BE EXTRAORDINARY WITHOUT TAKING CALCULATED RISKS Othmar Ammann was a Swiss-born engineer who immigrated to the United States. He started out as the chief engineer to the Port Authority of New York and within seven years, they promoted him to director of engineering. By all accounts, he had an important job. But for as long as he could remember, Ammann had dreamed of becoming an architect. So he left his coveted job and set out to open his own business. In the years that followed, Ammann contributed to some of the most impressive American bridges, including the Verrazano-Narrows, the Delaware Memorial, and the Walt Whitman. His ability to design and create ornate, complicated, and extravagant structures earned him multiple awards. Most impressive of all might be that Ammann was sixty years old when he switched careers. He continued to create architectural masterpieces right up until he was eighty-six. At an age when most people don’t want to take any more risks, Ammann chose to take a calculated risk that allowed him to live his dream. If we only take risks that make us the most comfortable, we’re likely missing out on some great opportunities. Taking calculated risks often mean the difference between living a mediocre life and living an extraordinary life. EMOTION INTERFERES WITH MAKING LOGICAL CHOICES You should have some fear about stepping into traffic. That fear reminds you that you should look both ways before you cross the road, so you can reduce the risk that you’ll get hit by a car. If you didn’t have any fear, you’d likely behave recklessly. But our “fear meters” aren’t always reliable. They sometimes go off even when we’re not in any actual danger. And when we feel afraid, we tend to behave accordingly, falsely believing “If it feels scary, it must be too risky.” For years, we’ve been warned against the dangers of anything from killer bees to mad cow disease. It seems like we’re constantly hearing various statistics, research studies, and warnings about so many perils that it becomes difficult to decipher the extent of danger we actually face in our lives. Take the research about cancer, for example. Some studies estimate cancer accounts for nearly one of every four deaths and other reports warn that within a few years about half of us will have cancer. Although those types of statistics can be a cause for alarm, they can often be misleading. A closer look at the numbers reveals a young healthy person who maintains a healthy lifestyle has a relatively low risk of developing cancer compared to an older, overweight person who smokes. But sometimes it’s hard to put our personal level of risk into perspective when we’re constantly bombarded with such frightening statistics. Manufacturers of cleaning solutions have worked hard to convince us we need powerful chemicals, hand sanitizers, and antibacterial soaps to protect ourselves from germs. Media stories warn us that our kitchen countertops have more germs than our toilet seats as we’re given visual reminders of how fast bacteria grows in a petri dish. Germaphobic people heed these warnings by taking drastic precautions to combat the risk of coming into contact with germs. They sanitize their homes daily with caustic chemicals, scrub their hands repeatedly with antibacterial products, and replace handshakes with fist bumps to reduce the spread of germs. But attempts to win the war on germs may actually do more harm than good. In fact, there’s research that shows getting rid of too many germs reduces our ability to build immunity from illness. A study from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center found that newborns who were exposed to germs, pet and rodent dander, and roach allergens were less likely to develop asthma and allergies. Fear leads many people to incorrectly assume that germs pose a much higher risk than they actually do, because in the reality, bacteria-free environments may pose a greater threat to our health than the germs. It’s important to be aware of your emotions throughout the decision-making process. If you’re feeling sad, you’re likely to anticipate failure and avoid the risk. If you’re feeling happy, you may disregard the risk and forge ahead. There’s even research that shows that fear of something completely unrelated to the risk can influence your decision. If you’re stressed about your job, and you’re also considering purchasing a new home, you’ll be more likely to view that home purchase as a bigger risk than if you weren’t feeling stressed at work. Often, we’re not good at separating what factors are influencing our feelings so we lump them all together. CALCULATE RISKS AND REDUCE FEAR It had never before occurred to Dale that he didn’t have to dive into a business headfirst. Once he began identifying ways to reduce the chances that he’d go bankrupt, he felt relieved and was able to think more logically about how he could turn his business into a reality. Clearly, there was a chance that he may not ever earn back the money he invested in starting the business, but after thinking it through, that was a calculated risk he was willing to accept. BALANCE EMOTION WITH LOGIC Don’t get fooled into thinking that your anxiety level should be the factor that helps you make the final decision about risk. Your feelings may be very unreliable. The more emotional you feel, the less logical your thoughts will be. Increase your rational thoughts about the risk you’re facing to balance out your emotional reaction. Many people are terrified to fly in airplanes. Often, this fear stems from a lack of control. The pilot is in control, not the passengers, and this lack of control instills fear. Many potential passengers are so afraid they choose to drive great distances to get to a destination instead of flying. But their decision to drive is based solely on emotion, not logic. Logic says that statistically, the odds of dying in a car crash are around 1 in 5,000, while the odds of dying in a plane crash are closer to 1 in 11 million. If you’re going to take a risk, especially one that could possibly involve your well-being, wouldn’t you want the odds in your favor? However, most people choose the option that will cause them the least amount of anxiety. Pay attention to the thoughts you have about taking the risk and make sure you’re basing your decision on facts, not just feelings. Most of the research shows that we are pretty bad at accurately calculating risk. Frighteningly, many of our major life decisions are based on complete irrationality: • We incorrectly judge how much control we have over a situation. We’re usually more willing to take bigger risks when we think we have more control. Most people feel more comfortable when they’re in the driver’s seat of a car for example, but just because you’re in the driver’s seat doesn’t mean you can avoid an accident. • We overcompensate when safeguards are in place. We behave more recklessly when we think there are safety nets in place, and ultimately, we increase our risk. People tend to speed more when they wear their seat belts. And insurance companies discovered that increased safety features on cars actually correlated with higher accident rates. • We don’t recognize the difference between skill and chance. Casinos have discovered that when gamblers play craps, they roll the dice differently depending on what type of number they need to win. When they want to roll a high number, they throw the dice hard. When they want a small number, they roll the dice softly. Even though it’s a game of chance, people behave as if it involves some level of skill. • We are influenced by our superstitious beliefs. Whether a business leader wears his lucky socks or a person reads his horoscope before leaving the house, superstitions impact our willingness to take risks. On average, ten thousand fewer people fly on Friday the thirteenth, and black cats are less likely to get adopted from a shelter on that day. Although research shows most people think crossing their fingers increases their luck, in reality, it does nothing to mitigate risk. • We become easily deluded when we see a potentially large payoff. Even when the odds are stacked against you, if you really like the potential payoff, like in the lottery for example, you’ll likely overestimate your odds of success. • We grow comfortable with familiarity. The more often we take a risk, the more we tend to miscalculate how big of a risk we’re actually taking. If you take the same risk over and over again, you’ll stop perceiving it as risky. If you speed on your way to work every day, you’ll greatly underestimate the danger you’re putting yourself in. • We place a lot of faith in other people’s abilities to perceive risk accurately. Emotions can be contagious. If you’re in a crowd of people who don’t react to the smell of smoke, it’s likely you might not sense much danger. In contrast, if other people begin to panic, you’re much more likely to react. • We can be influenced by the media in how we perceive risk. If you are constantly exposed to news stories about a rare disease, you’re more likely to think your chances of contracting the disease are higher, even if all the news stories are only reporting on isolated incidents. Similarly, stories about natural disasters or tragic events can cause you to feel you are at a greater risk of catastrophe than you actually are. MINIMIZE RISK MAXIMIZE SUCCESS Every year at my high school’s graduation ceremony the valedictorian was expected to give a speech. Halfway through my senior year, when I learned I was going to be the valedictorian, my fear of giving a speech outweighed my excitement about having the highest GPA in my class. I was incredibly shy, to the point that I usually didn’t speak in class, even though my classmates were people I’d known since kindergarten. The thought of standing at a podium and giving a speech in front of a packed auditorium was enough to make me weak in the knees. When I tried writing my speech, I had no words to put down on the paper. I was too distracted by the thought of having to speak the words in front of a crowd of people. But I knew I had to get something together, because the clock was ticking. And common advice like “Picture the audience in their underwear” or “Practice reading your speech in front of a mirror” wasn’t going to be enough to calm my nerves. I was terrified. So I spent some time thinking about what my biggest fear with public speaking actually was. And it turns out, I was afraid of the audience’s rejection. I kept imagining that after I had finished my speech, the audience would remain completely silent, because whatever I had just mumbled was either completely inaudible or so horribly presented that no one could muster a clap. So, to mitigate my risk, I had a conversation with my best friends and they helped me devise a brilliant plan. The plan reduced my risk and nerves enough that I was able to write my speech. A few weeks later, on graduation day, I was feeling incredibly nervous as I stood at the podium. My voice cracked the entire time, as I offered whatever advice an eighteen-year-old could possibly offer her fellow classmates. But I got through it. And when I was done, my friends followed through with our plan. On cue, they stood up and cheered like they’d just witnessed the best rock concert in the world. And what happens when a few people in a room stand up to applaud? Other people follow suit. I received a standing ovation. Was it earned? Maybe. Probably not. And to this day, that part doesn’t really matter to me. The point was, I knew if I could get rid of my biggest fear—that no one would clap for me—I could get through the speech. The level of risk you’ll experience in a given situation is unique to you. While speaking in front of a group is a risk to some people, it’s not risky at all to others. Ask yourself the following questions to help you calculate your risk level: • What are the potential costs? Sometimes the cost of taking a risk is tangible—like the money you might spend on an investment—but other times, intangible costs are associated with risk, like the risk of being rejected. • What are the potential benefits? Consider the potential positive outcome of taking the risk. Look at what would happen if the risk turns out well. Do you stand to gain increased finances? Better relationships? Improved health? There needs to be a big enough payoff to outweigh the potential costs. • How will this help me achieve my goal? It is important to examine your bigger goals and look at how this risk plays into that goal. For example, if you are hoping to gain more money, look at how opening your own business could help you with that goal as you examine your risk. • What are the alternatives? Sometimes we look at risk as if we only have two choices—take the risk or pass it up. But, often, there are many different types of opportunities that can help you reach your goals. It’s important to recognize those alternatives that may lie in between so you can make the most well-informed decision. • How good would it be if the best-case scenario came true? Spend some time really thinking about the payoff in a risk and how that payoff could impact your life. Try to develop realistic expectations for how the best-case scenario could benefit you. • What is the worst thing that could happen and how could I reduce the risk it will occur? It’s also important to really examine the worst-possible scenario and then think about steps you could take to minimize the risk that it would happen. For example, if you are considering investing in a business, how could you increase your chance for success? • How bad would it be if the worst-case scenario did come true? Just like hospitals, cities, and governments have disaster-preparedness plans, it can be helpful to create your own. Develop a plan for how you could respond if the worst-case scenario did occur. • How much will this decision matter in five years? To help you keep things in perspective, ask yourself how much this particular risk is likely to impact your future. If it’s a small risk, you probably won’t even remember it a few years from now. If it’s a big risk, it could greatly impact your future. It can be helpful to write down your answers so you can review them and read them over. Be willing to do more research and gain as much information as possible when you don’t have the facts available to help you calculate a risk properly. When the information is not available, resolve to make the best decision you can with the information you have. PRACTICE TAKING RISKS Prior to his death in 2007, Psychology Today named Albert Ellis the “greatest living psychologist.” Ellis was known for teaching people how to challenge their self-defeating thoughts and beliefs. He didn’t just teach these principles, he also lived them. As a young man, Ellis was incredibly shy and he feared talking to women. He was terrified of getting rejected, so he avoided ever asking a woman out on a date. But, ultimately, he knew that rejection wasn’t the worst thing in the world and decided to face his fears. He went to a local botanical garden every day for a month. Whenever he saw a woman sitting by herself on a bench, he sat next to her. He forced himself to start up a conversation within one minute of sitting down. In that month, he found 130 opportunities to speak with women and of those 130, 30 women got up and walked away as soon as he sat down. But he started conversations with the rest. Out of the 100 women he invited on a date, one said yes—however, she didn’t show up. But Ellis didn’t despair. Instead, it reinforced to him that he could tolerate taking risks even when he feared rejection. By facing his fears, Ellis recognized his irrational thoughts that had made him more fearful of taking risks. Understanding how these thoughts influenced his feelings helped him later develop new therapy techniques that would help other people challenge their irrational thinking. Like Ellis, monitor the outcome of the risks that you take. Take notice of how you felt before, during, and after taking a risk. Ask yourself what you learned and how you can apply that knowledge to future decisions. TAKING CALCULATED RISKS MAKES YOU STRONGER Richard Branson, founder of the United Kingdom–based Virgin Group, is known for taking risks. After all, you don’t get to own four hundred companies without taking some leaps along the way. But he’s taken calculated risks that have certainly paid off for him. As a child, Branson struggled in school. He had dyslexia and his academic performance suffered. But he didn’t let that hold him back. Instead, as a young teen he started business ventures. At the age of fifteen, he began a bird-breeding business. His business pursuits quickly grew as he went on to own record companies, airlines, and mobile phone companies. His empire has expanded to a current net worth estimated to be around 5 billion. Although he could easily sit back and enjoy the fruits of his labor, Branson loves to continue challenging himself and his employees every day. “At Virgin, I use two techniques to free our team from the same old routine: breaking records and making bets,” Branson wrote in an article for Entrepreneur magazine. “Taking chances is a great way to test myself and our group, and also push boundaries while having fun together.” And push boundaries he does. His teams create products that people say won’t work. They break records that people claim are impossible. And they accept challenges that no one else attempts. But through it all, Branson acknowledges his risks are “strategic judgments, not blind gambles.” Success won’t find you. You have to pursue it. Stepping into the unknown to take carefully calculated risks can help you reach your dreams and fulfill your goals. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS Monitor the type of risks you’re taking and how you feel about those risks. Also, take note about which opportunities you are passing up. This can help ensure that you are taking the risks that could benefit you the most, even the kind that cause some anxiety. Remember that calculating risks takes practice, but with practice, you can learn and grow. WHAT’S HELPFUL Being aware of emotional reactions to risk taking Identifying types of risks that are particularly challenging Recognizing irrational thoughts that influence your decision making Educating yourself about the facts Spending time calculating each risk before making a decision Practicing taking risks and monitoring the results so you can learn from each risk you take WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Basing your decisions about risk on how you feel Avoiding the types of risk that stir up the most fear Allowing irrational thoughts to influence your willingness to try something new Ignoring the facts or not making an effort to learn more when you lack the information you need to make the best choice Reacting impulsively without taking time to weigh the risk Refusing to take risks that cause you discomfort OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 7 THEY DON’T DWELL ON THE PAST We do not heal the past by dwelling there; we heal the past by living fully in the present. —MARIANNE WILLIAMSON Gloria was a hardworking fifty-five-year-old woman who had been referred to counseling after telling her doctor that she was feeling extremely stressed. Her twenty-eight-year-old daughter had recently moved back in with her again. Since moving out of Gloria’s home at eighteen she’d been back at least a dozen times. She’d usually find a new boyfriend and within weeks, if not days, of meeting him, she’d move in with him. But it never worked out and she’d always move back in with Gloria. Gloria’s daughter was unemployed and she wasn’t actively looking for work. She spent her days watching TV and surfing the Internet. She couldn’t be bothered to help out around the house, or even clean up after herself. Although Gloria said she felt like she was offering hotel and maid services, she always welcomed her daughter to stay with her. She thought giving her daughter a place to stay was the least she could do. She hadn’t given her daughter the childhood she most likely deserved, and she admitted she hadn’t been a very good mother. After she and her husband divorced, Gloria had dated a lot of men, and many of them weren’t healthy role models. Gloria now understood she’d invested too much energy into drinking and dating rather than parenting. And she felt like the mistakes she made were the reason her daughter was struggling so much now. It was clear from the start that Gloria’s shame over the way she’d parented led her to enable her daughter now that she was an adult. The majority of Gloria’s stress stemmed from her anxiety over her daughter’s immature behavior. She worried about her daughter’s future and she wanted her to be able to have a job and live independently. The more we talked, the more Gloria recognized that her shame and guilt were interfering with her ability to be a good parent now. She had to forgive herself and stop dwelling on the past if she wanted to move forward and do what was best for her daughter. When I asked her to consider the likelihood that her daughter would simply wake up one day and start behaving responsibly given the current conditions, Gloria acknowledged that wasn’t going to happen but she wasn’t sure what to do. Over the next few weeks, we explored how Gloria viewed the past. Whenever she thought about her daughter’s childhood, she’d think things like I am such a bad person for not always putting my daughter’s needs first or It’s my fault my daughter has so many problems. We explored her thoughts, and slowly but surely, Gloria learned how her self-condemnation influenced the way she treated her daughter in the present. Gradually, Gloria began to accept the reality that while she wasn’t an idyllic mother, punishing herself for that today would not change the past. She also began to recognize that her current behavior toward her daughter wasn’t making amends but instead enabling her daughter’s self-destructive behavior. Armed with her new attitude, Gloria created some rules and set limits with her daughter. She told her that she could only remain living in her home if she were actively looking for work. She was willing to give her some time to get back on her feet, but starting in two months, she’d need to pay rent if she were going to continue living at home. Although her daughter was initially upset with Gloria’s new rules, she began looking for work within a few days. Within a few weeks Gloria entered my office to proudly announce that her daughter had a job and unlike some of the other jobs she’d had before, this one could become a career. She said she’d seen huge changes in her daughter since she was offered this job and she was talking a lot more about her future aspirations. Although Gloria hadn’t yet completely forgiven herself for the past, she recognized that the only thing worse than being a bad parent for eighteen years would be to be a bad parent for another eighteen years. STUCK IN HISTORY Sometimes people dwell on the things that happened years ago, while others tend to dwell on whatever happened last week. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar? You wish you could press the rewind button so you could redo portions of your life. You struggle with major regrets about your past. You spend a lot of time wondering how life would have turned out if only you had chosen a slightly different path. You sometimes feel like the best days of your life are already behind you. You replay past memories in your mind like a scene from a movie over and over again. You sometimes imagine saying or doing something differently in past memories to try and create a different outcome. You punish yourself or convince yourself you don’t deserve to be happy. You feel ashamed of your past. When you make a mistake or experience an embarrassing episode, you keep repeatedly replaying the event in your mind. You invest a lot of time in thinking about all the things you “should have” or “could have” done differently. Although self-reflection is healthy, dwelling can be self-destructive, preventing you from enjoying the present and planning for the future. But you don’t have to stay stuck in the past. You can choose to start living in the moment. WHY WE DWELL ON THE PAST Gloria’s daughter often manipulated her mother by preying on her guilt, reminding Gloria that she wasn’t always there for her as a child, which only fueled Gloria’s remorse. If her daughter hadn’t yet forgiven her, how could Gloria possibly forgive herself? She accepted her feelings of constant guilt as part of her penance for the mistakes she’d made, and as a result she continued to dwell on the past. Lingering guilt, shame, and anger are just a few of the feelings that can keep you stuck in the past. You might subconsciously think, If I stay miserable long enough, I’ll eventually be able to forgive myself. You may not even be aware that deep down, you don’t believe you deserve happiness. THE FEAR OF MOVING FORWARD MAKES US WANT TO STAY STUCK IN THE PAST Two weeks after my mother passed away, my dad’s house caught on fire. The fire was contained to the basement, but smoke and black soot permeated throughout the house. Everything in the entire house had to be cleaned from top to bottom by a crew hired by the insurance company. All my mother’s belongings were handled by complete strangers. And it bothered me. I had wanted things to stay just the way my mother had left them. I wanted her clothes to stay hung in the closet the same way she had arranged them. I wanted her Christmas decorations to stay in the boxes in the same way she’d organized them. I wanted to someday—way down the road—open her jewelry box and see how she had last placed her jewelry. But we didn’t have that luxury. Instead, everything got rearranged. Her clothes no longer smelled like her. I had no way of even knowing what the last book was that she was reading. And we’d never be able to sort through her belongings at our own pace. A few years later when Lincoln died, I again wanted everything to stay frozen in time. I felt like if I studied the way he kept his clothing hung in the closet, or if I could figure out which order he’d read his books in, I’d be able to learn more about him, even though he was gone. I thought that if things got moved around, thrown out, or reorganized, I’d lose my opportunity to study valuable clues that could give me more insight and information about him. It was as if I could keep him with me if I made sure there were always more things to learn. Maybe a scrap of paper would have a note on it. Or maybe I’d find a picture I’d never seen before. I wanted to somehow create new memories that included Lincoln, even though he wasn’t there. Although we’d been together for six years, it just wasn’t enough. I wasn’t ready to let go of anything that reminded me of him. I thought I’d be leaving him behind if I got rid of his belongings that I no longer needed, and I didn’t want that. My attempts to keep everything frozen in time didn’t work. Obviously, the rest of the world kept going. And over the course of many months, I was able to begin to let go of my desire to keep everything as if it were in a time capsule. Slowly, I would reassure myself that it was okay to throw away something with Lincoln’s handwriting on it. And I started to get rid of the magazines he kept receiving in the mail. But I have to admit, it took me two years to finally throw away his toothbrush. I knew he didn’t need it, but somehow throwing it away almost seemed like a betrayal. It seemed more comfortable to dwell in the past, because that’s where Lincoln, and my memories of him, lived. But to stay stuck there, while the rest of the world changed and moved forward, wasn’t healthy or helpful. I had to trust that moving forward wouldn’t cause me to forget any of my wonderful memories. Even though as a therapist I help people work on their rational thinking, grief brought on a lot of irrational thoughts. It made me want to dwell on the past, because the past was where Lincoln was alive. But if I had spent all my time thinking about the past, I’d have never been able to create new and happy memories again. DWELLING ON THE PAST DISTRACTS YOU FROM THE PRESENT It’s not just sad or tragic events that leave people focused on the past. Sometimes we dwell on the past as a way to distract ourselves from the present. Perhaps you know that forty-year-old former high school quarterback who still squeezes into his varsity jacket and talks about his “old glory days.” Or maybe you’re friends with the thirty-five-year-old mom who still lists “prom queen” as one of her biggest accomplishments. Often, we romanticize the past as a way to escape problems in the present. If, for example, you’re not happy in your current relationship, or if you’re not in a relationship at all, it may be tempting to spend a lot of time thinking about a past love. Perhaps you wish that your last relationship had worked out or you still think if you’d married your high school sweetheart, you’d be better off. It can be tempting to fixate on how much easier or happier life was “back then.” You may even begin to regret some of the decisions you made that landed you where you are today and say things like “If only I’d married my old boyfriend, I’d still be happy”; “If I hadn’t dropped out of college, I’d have a job I love”; or “If I didn’t agree to move to a new city, I’d still have a good life.” The truth is, we don’t know what life would have had in store for us had we not made those choices. But it’s easy for us to imagine that life could be better if we could only change the past. THE PROBLEM WITH DWELLING ON THE PAST Gloria couldn’t see her daughter as a capable adult; all she could see were her own mistakes. Her guilt prevented her from focusing on the present and as a result, she enabled her daughter’s irresponsible behavior. Unfortunately, her daughter was repeating a lot of the same mistakes Gloria had made. Dwelling on the past was not only holding Gloria back from reaching her full potential, but it was also holding her daughter back from maturing into a responsible adult. Ruminating on the past won’t change it. Instead, wasting your time dwelling on what’s already happened will only lead to more problems in the future. Here are some of the ways that dwelling on the past can interfere with your ability to be your best self: • You miss out on the present. You can’t enjoy the present if your mind is constantly stuck in the past. You’ll miss out on experiencing new opportunities and celebrating the joys of today if you’re distracted by things that have already occurred. • Dwelling on the past makes it impossible to adequately prepare for the future. You won’t be able to clearly define your goals or stay motivated to create change when a big part of you remains stuck in the past. • Dwelling on the past interferes with your decision-making skills. When you have unresolved issues from the past, those conflicts will cloud your thinking. You won’t be able to adequately make healthy decisions about what’s best for you today when you can’t get over something that happened yesterday. • Dwelling on the past doesn’t solve anything. Replaying the same scripts in your head and focusing on things you no longer have control over won’t resolve anything. • Dwelling on the past can lead to depression. Ruminating on negative events conjures up negative emotions. And when you feel sad, the more likely you are to conjure up even more sad memories. Dwelling on past times can be a vicious cycle that keeps you stuck in the same emotional state. • Romanticizing the past—the grass-is-greener philosophy—isn’t helpful. It’s easy to convince yourself that you felt happier, more confident, and completely carefree back then. But there’s a good chance you’re exaggerating how great things used to be. It can also make you exaggerate how bad things are now. • Dwelling on the past is bad for your physical health. Thinking constantly about negative events increases inflammation in your body, according to a 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Ohio. Dwelling on the past could put you at a greater risk for diseases associated with heart disease, cancer, and dementia. STOP THE PAST FROM HOLDING YOU BACK Once Gloria recognized that she could learn from her past, rather than just beating herself up over it, her thinking shifted. She began changing her behavior and the way she parented her daughter. This helped her recognize how her past mistakes taught her valuable lessons about parenting. Over the course of a couple of months she was able to recall her earlier parenting mistakes without an overwhelming sense of shame. SHIFT YOUR THINKING Dwelling starts out as a cognitive process, but eventually it influences your emotions and behavior. By shifting the way you think about the past, you can move forward. • Schedule time to think about a past event. Sometimes our brains need a chance to sort things out and the more you tell yourself not to think about it, the more those memories can crop up throughout the day. Instead of battling to suppress the memories, remind yourself, I can think about that after dinner tonight. Then, after dinner, give yourself twenty minutes to think about it. When your time is up, move on to something else. • Give yourself something else to think about. Create a plan to help you think about something else. For example, decide that whenever you think about that job you didn’t get, you’ll shift your focus to thinking about planning your next vacation. This can be especially helpful if you’re prone to dwell on the negative right before you go to sleep at night. • Establish goals for the future. It’s impossible to dwell on the past if you’re planning for the future. Establish both short-term and long-term goals and begin working on the action steps needed to achieve those goals. It will give you something to look forward to while also preventing you from looking too much into the past. Our memories aren’t as accurate as we think they are. Often, when we recall unpleasant events, we exaggerate and catastrophize them. If you think about something you said during a meeting that you later regretted, you may envision that other people were reacting much more negatively than they actually did. When you recall negative memories, try these strategies to keep your experiences in perspective: • Focus on the lessons you learned. If you’ve endured hard times, focus on what you’ve learned from that experience. Accept that it happened and think about how you may be a changed person because of it but realize that doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Maybe you learned to speak up because you allowed yourself to be treated poorly, or perhaps you learned that you need to be honest if you want relationships to last. Some of the best life lessons can be learned from the toughest times you’ve endured. • Think about the facts, not the emotion. Thinking about negative events can be very distressing because you’ll likely focus on how you felt during the event. But if you recall an event by walking yourself through the facts and details of the memory, your distress decreases. Instead of dwelling on how you felt when you went to a funeral, recall specific details about where you sat, what you wore, who was there. When you begin to take away the emotion surrounding an event, you’re less likely to dwell on it. • Look at the situation differently. When you review your past, examine what other ways there are to look at the same situation. You have control over how you weave the story. The same story can be told countless ways and still be true. If your current version is upsetting, see how else you can look at it. For example, Gloria could have reminded herself that her daughter’s current choices weren’t all related to her childhood. She could have recognized that although she may have made some mistakes, she was not responsible for the choices her daughter was making now. MAKE PEACE WITH THE PAST When James Barrie was six years old, his thirteen-year-old brother, David, died in an ice skating accident. Although his mother had ten children total, it was no secret that David had been her favorite. After his death, she was so distraught she could hardly cope with life. So at the age of six, Barrie did everything he could to compensate for his mother’s grief. He even tried to take over the role of David to help fill the void his mother felt from his death. He dressed in David’s clothing and learned how to whistle the same way David used to. He became her constant companion as he devoted his entire childhood to trying to make his mother smile again. Despite Barrie’s attempts to make his mother happy, she often warned him about the hardships of being an adult. She told him to never grow up because adulthood was only filled with grief and unhappiness. She even said she took some relief knowing that David would never have to grow up and face the realities of adulthood. In an attempt to please his mother, Barrie resisted maturity as much as he could. He especially didn’t want to grow any older than David had been when he’d passed away. He tried with all his might to remain a child. His attempts to stay a boy even seemed to stunt his physical growth as he hardly reached five feet tall. After he finished school, Barrie wanted to become an author. But his family pressured him to go on to study at a university, because that’s what David would have done. So Barrie found a compromise—he’d continue his education but he’d study literature. Barrie went on to pen one of the most famous works of children’s literature, Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up. Originally written as a play, which later became a famous movie, the main character, Peter Pan, faces the conflict between the innocence of childhood and the responsibility of adulthood. Peter chooses to remain a child and encourages all the other children to do the same. As the legendary fairy tale, it seems like a delightful children’s story. But when you know the author’s history, the anecdote is quite tragic. Barrie’s mother couldn’t move forward after the death of her son. She was convinced that childhood was the best time of her life and that the present and future were only riddled with pain and agony. As an extreme case of someone who dwelled on the past, she allowed it to interfere with the well-being of her children. It affected Barrie not just during his childhood, but also throughout his adulthood. The misconceptions we hold about grief can contribute to our choice to live in the past. Many people wrongly believe that the amount of time you grieve over someone is directly proportional to the amount of love you had for someone. If you cared a little about someone who died, you may grieve for months. But if you really loved that person, you’d grieve for years or even for the rest of your life. But the truth is, there isn’t a right amount of time to grieve. In fact, you may grieve for years, or even forever, but the amount of sadness you feel doesn’t equate to the amount of love you had for that person. Hopefully, you have many cherished memories of your loved one. But moving forward means actively working toward creating new memories for yourself, making the best decisions for you, and not always doing what someone else would want you to do. If you find yourself ruminating on some aspect of your past, you may need to take action to make peace with the past. Here are some ways to make peace with the past: • Give yourself permission to move forward. Sometimes you just need to give yourself permission to move forward. Moving forward doesn’t mean you have to leave your memories of a loved one behind, but it does mean you can do the things you need to do to enjoy the moment and get the most you can out of life. • Recognize the emotional toll of dwelling on the past versus moving forward. Sometimes dwelling on the past is a strategy that works in the short term but not in the long term. If you think about the past, you don’t have to focus on what’s going on right now. But, over the long term, there are consequences. Recognize what you’ll miss out on in life if your attention is focused on the past. • Practice forgiveness. Whether you’re dwelling on past hurt and anger because you can’t forgive yourself or because you can’t forgive someone else, forgiveness can help you let go of that hurt. Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting something happened. If someone hurt you, you can forgive them while still deciding not to have any more contact, for example. Instead, focus on letting go so you don’t stay consumed with the hurt and anger. • Change behavior that keeps you stuck in the past. If you find yourself avoiding certain activities—because you are afraid it will drudge up bad memories or because you feel like you don’t deserve to do them—consider doing them anyway. You can’t change the past. But you can choose to accept it. If you’ve made mistakes, you can’t go back and fix them or erase them. You may be able to try and take steps to repair some of the damage you’ve caused, but it won’t make everything better. • Seek professional help if necessary. Sometimes traumatic events can lead to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Near-death experiences, for example, can lead to flashbacks and nightmares that make it difficult to make peace with the past. Professional counseling can help reduce the distress associated with traumatic memories so you can move forward more productively. HOW MAKING PEACE WITH THE PAST WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER Wynona Ward grew up in rural Vermont. Her family was poor, and as in many homes in the area, domestic violence was common. Ward’s father routinely physically and sexually abused her. She often witnessed her father beating her mother. Although doctors treated her mother’s wounds and neighbors heard their screams, no one ever intervened. Ward kept her family problems a secret. She immersed herself in her academics and excelled in school. At the age of seventeen, she left home and got married. She and her husband became over-the-road truck drivers. After sixteen years of traveling the country as a truck driver, Ward learned that her older brother had abused a young family member. It was at that moment that she decided that she had to do something. She decided to go back to school so she could help put an end to the generational abuse that was going on within her family. Ward enrolled in the University of Vermont and studied from the truck while her husband drove. She completed her degree and went on to further her education at Vermont Law School. Upon getting her law degree, she used a small grant to start Have Justice Will Travel, an organization that serves families in rural areas affected by domestic violence. Ward provides rural domestic violence victims with free legal representation. She also connects them with the appropriate social services. Because many families lack the resources or transportation to travel to an office, Ward travels to them. She provides education and services that help families put an end to generational cycles of abuse. Instead of dwelling on her horrific past, Ward chooses to focus on what she can do to help other people in the present. Refusing to dwell on the past doesn’t mean you pretend the past didn’t happen. In fact, it often means embracing and accepting your experiences so you can live in the present. Doing so frees up your mental energy and allows you to plan for your future based on who you want to become, not who you used to be. Anger, shame, and guilt can run your life if you’re not careful. Letting go of those emotions helps you to be in charge of your life. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS If you spend all your time looking in the rearview mirror, you can’t look out the windshield. Staying stuck in the past will prevent you from enjoying the future. Recognize times when you’re dwelling on the past and take the steps necessary to heal your emotions so you can move forward. WHAT’S HELPFUL Reflecting on the past enough that you can learn from it Moving forward in your life, even when it may be painful to do so Actively working through grief so you can focus on the present and plan for the future Thinking about negative events in terms of facts, not emotions Finding ways to make peace with the past WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Trying to pretend the past didn’t happen Trying to prevent yourself from moving forward in life Focusing on what you’ve lost in life without being able to live in the present Replaying painful events in your mind repeatedly and focusing on how you felt during them Trying to undo the past or make up for your past mistakes OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 8 THEY DON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. —JOHN POWELL When Kristy entered my therapy office, the first thing she said was, “I have a college degree and I’m smart enough not to yell at my coworkers. So why can’t I stop yelling at my kids?” Every morning she made a promise that she wasn’t going to yell at her two teenagers. But almost every evening she found herself raising her voice toward at least one of them. She told me she yelled because she felt frustrated when her kids didn’t listen to her. And lately, it seemed like they hardly ever listened. Her thirteen-year-old daughter often refused to do her chores and her fifteen-year-old son wasn’t putting any effort into his homework. Whenever Kristy came home from a long day at work to find them watching TV and playing video games, she told them to get to work. But they usually talked back and Kristy resorted to yelling. Kristy clearly knew that yelling wasn’t good for her kids. She recognized that it only made the situation worse. She prided herself on being an intelligent and successful person, so it surprised her when she struggled to get this area of her life under control. Kristy spent a couple of sessions examining why she kept making the same mistake over and over. She discovered that she really didn’t know how to discipline the kids without yelling, and she wasn’t going to be able to stop yelling at her kids until she had a plan about what to do instead. So we worked on various strategies she could use to respond to disrespectful and defiant behavior. Kristy decided she’d offer one warning, and then follow through with a consequence if her kids didn’t do as she asked. She also needed to learn how to recognize when she was getting angry, so she could step away from a situation before she started yelling. Her downfall seemed to be that when she lost her cool, her rational thoughts about discipline went out the window. I further worked with Kristy to help her find a new way to think about discipline. When she first came to me, she admitted that she felt it was her responsibility to make her kids do what she said, at all costs, because if they didn’t, it would mean they won. But this approach always seemed to backfire. Once Kristy could let go of the idea she needed to win a power struggle, she developed a new outlook on discipline. If her children chose not to follow her directions, she took away their electronics without arguing and trying to force them to behave. It took some practice for Kristy to change her parenting strategies. There were times where she still found herself resorting to yelling, but she was now equipped with alternative discipline strategies. Each time she found herself slipping, she could review her triggers and identify strategies to prevent raising her voice again the next time. REPEAT OFFENDER Although we’d like to think we learn from our mistakes the first time around, the truth is, everyone repeats mistakes sometimes. That’s just part of being human. Mistakes can be behavioral—like showing up late for work—or they can be cognitive. Thinking errors include always assuming people don’t like you or never planning ahead. Although someone may say “Next time I won’t jump to conclusions,” they may repeat those same thinking errors if they’re not careful. Do any of the points below sound familiar? You often find yourself stuck at the same point when you’re trying to reach a goal. When you encounter an obstacle, you don’t invest much time looking for new ways to overcome it. You find it hard to give up your bad habits because you keep falling back on your old ways. You don’t invest much time in analyzing why your attempts to reach your goals are unsuccessful. You get mad at yourself because you can’t get rid of some of your bad habits. You sometimes say things like “I’ll never do that again,” only to find yourself doing the same thing all over again. Sometimes it just feels like it takes too much effort to learn new ways to do things. You often feel frustrated by your lack of self-discipline. Your motivation to do things differently disappears as soon as you begin to feel uncomfortable or upset. Did any of those points resonate with you? Sometimes we just don’t learn the first time. But there are steps we can take to avoid repeating the unhealthy mistakes that hold us back from reaching our goals. WHY WE MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES Despite her frustration, Kristy had never truly thought about why she yelled or what alternatives could be more effective. Initially, she was hesitant to follow through with a new discipline plan because she worried that removing privileges would only anger her children further and lead to more disrespectful behavior. She had to gain confidence in her parenting abilities before she could stop repeating the same mistakes. If someone says “I’m never going to do that again,” why on earth would the person keep doing it over and over? The truth is, our behavior is complicated. For a long time, many teachers held the common belief that if a child was allowed to guess an answer incorrectly, she would be in danger of accidently memorizing the wrong answer. For example, if a child guessed that 4 + 4 = 6, she’d always recall 6 as the right answer, even after she was corrected. To prevent this, teachers gave kids the answers first without allowing them to make an educated guess. Fast-forward to 2012, when a research study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition showed that as long as study participants were given a chance to learn the correct information, they could learn from previous mistakes. In fact, researchers found that when kids thought about potential answers, even if those answers were incorrect, their retention rates for the correct answers improved once their mistakes were corrected. Kids, just like adults, are able to learn from their mistakes when they’re given the opportunity. Despite the fact that we now have a study that proves we can learn from our mistakes, it is difficult to completely unlearn what we were taught when we were younger. Growing up, you may have learned it’s better to hide your mistakes than face the consequences. And school wasn’t the only place we built our understanding of handling mistakes. Celebrities, politicians, and athletes are commonly portrayed in the media as trying to cover up their missteps. They lie and attempt to talk their way out of admitting they did anything wrong even when there’s evidence to the contrary. And when we deny our mistakes, we are less likely to examine them and gain any true understanding or lessons from them, making us more susceptible to repeating them in the future. We’ve all heard this line before: “I stand by my decisions . . .” This is an acknowledgment of behavior but falls short of admitting a mistake, all because of pride. Being stubborn is a big factor for repeat offenders too. A person who makes a poor investment may say “Well, I’ve got so much invested in this now; I might as well just keep going.” Rather than just losing a little money, he’d rather risk more because he’s too stubborn to stop. Someone in a job she despises may say, “I’ve devoted ten years of my life to this company. I don’t want to walk away now.” But the only thing worse than investing ten years into something unhealthy or unproductive is investing ten years and one day. Impulsivity is another reason people repeat mistakes. Although there’s a lot to be said for “dusting yourself off and getting right back up on the horse,” it is wiser to figure out why you fell off in the first place before you try again. Find yourself stuck in a state of perpetually repeating mistakes? You might be getting too comfortable. A woman may enter into one bad relationship after another because it’s all she knows. She may keep dating men all within the same social circle who have similar problems because she lacks the confidence to look for a better prospect elsewhere. Similarly, a man may keep turning to alcohol when he feels stressed because he doesn’t know how to cope with problems sober. To avoid those mistakes and do something different would feel uncomfortable. And then there are those individuals who feel so uncomfortable with success that they sabotage their own efforts. When things are going well, they may feel anxious while waiting “for the other shoe to drop.” To relieve that anxiety, they resort to their old self-destructive behavior and repeat the same mistakes. THE PROBLEM WITH REPEATING OUR MISTAKES Kristy recognized that yelling at her kids every day wasn’t helpful. She wasn’t teaching them how to solve problems effectively, and they were learning that yelling was acceptable behavior. The more she yelled at them, the more they yelled right back at her. Have you ever watched a dog chase its tail around and around in a circle? That’s what you feel like when you repeat your mistakes. You’ll tire out, yet you won’t get anywhere. Julie came to see me for therapy because she was mad at herself. She had lost forty pounds last year but then slowly, over the last six months, she gained it all back. This wasn’t the first time this had happened. She’d been gaining and losing the same forty pounds for almost a decade. She was extremely frustrated that she devoted so much time and energy into losing weight only to keep gaining it right back. Every time she lost the weight she relaxed a little. She’d allow herself to have a second helping with dinner or she’d celebrate with ice cream. She’d find an excuse to skip a few workouts and before she knew it, she was gaining weight again. She’d quickly grown disgusted with herself and she wondered, “How can I not be in control of what I do to my own body?” Julie’s story certainly isn’t unique. In fact, statistically, the vast majority of people who lose weight gain it back again. Losing weight is hard work. So why would anyone go through the pain of losing it just to gain it all back? Often, it’s because people begin repeating the same mistakes that caused them to become overweight in the first place. Repeating the same mistakes leads to many problems, such as the following: • You won’t reach your goals. Whether you’re trying to lose weight for the fifth time or you’re working on quitting smoking for the tenth time, if you keep repeating the same mistakes, you won’t ever reach your goals. Instead, you’ll stay stuck at the same point and won’t be able to move forward. • The problem won’t get solved. It’s a vicious cycle. When you repeat a mistake, the problem perpetuates and you’re more likely to just keep doing the same thing. You’ll never be able to solve a problem until you do something differently. • You’ll think differently about yourself. You may begin to view yourself as incompetent or a complete failure because you can’t get past a certain obstacle. • You may not try as hard. If the first few attempts weren’t successful, you may be more likely to give up. When you don’t try as hard, you’re less likely to succeed. • You may frustrate others who watch you repeat the same mistakes. If you’re guilty of always getting yourself caught up in similar problems, your friends and family may grow tired of hearing you complain. Worse yet, if they’ve had to bail you out because you’ve repeatedly gotten yourself into problematic situations, your repeated mistakes will damage your relationships. • You may develop irrational beliefs to excuse your mistakes. Instead of looking at how your behavior is interfering with your progress, you may conclude it’s just not “meant to be.” An overweight person who struggles to lose weight and keep it off may simply decide, “I’m big-boned. I wasn’t meant to be smaller.” AVOID MAKING THE SAME BLUNDERS OVER AND OVER AGAIN To break the yelling cycle Kristy found herself stuck in, she first had to examine her discipline style and then come up with alternative consequences. She knew that in the beginning, her kids would likely test the new restrictions she imposed, so it wasn’t until she developed a solid plan to deal with her emotions that she could effectively manage their misbehavior without losing her cool. STUDY THE MISTAKE In the mid-1800s, Rowland Macy opened a dry goods store in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Even though he opened the store in a quiet part of town that rarely attracted visitors, let alone customers, he was certain that his store would draw attention. But he was wrong and he was soon struggling to keep the doors open. In an attempt to attract business to his part of town, he arranged for a large parade, complete with a marching band, to lure people into the streets. The parade ended in front of the store where a well-known businessman from Boston was scheduled to give a speech. Unfortunately, due to extremely hot weather on the day of the parade, no one ventured outdoors to follow the band as Rowland had expected. His marketing mistakes cost him a lot of money and, ultimately, his business. However, Rowland was someone who learned from his mistakes and just a few short years later, he opened “R.H. Macy Dry Goods” in downtown New York. This was his fifth store, following his previous four failed businesses. But from each mistake he made, he learned something new. And by the time he opened “R.H. Macy Dry Goods,” he had learned a lot about running a business and marketing it successfully. Macy’s Department Store has gone on to become one of the most successful stores in the world. Unlike Rowland’s first parade, which was held during the high heat of summer, the store now carries out its annual parade, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade during the cool fall weather. Not only does it attract large crowds into the streets, but it’s also broadcast on TV to more than forty-four million viewers each year. Rowland Macy didn’t simply look for excuses about why his first business ventures weren’t successful. Instead, he studied the facts and took responsibility for his part in each mistake. Then he was able to apply that knowledge to help him do something different the next time. If you want to avoid repeating a mistake, spend some time studying it. Set any negative feelings you might have aside, acknowledge the factors that led up to your misstep, and learn from it. Look for an explanation without making an excuse. Ask yourself the following questions: • What went wrong? Spend a little bit of time reflecting on your mistakes. Try to discern the facts about what happened. Maybe you overspend on your budget every month because you can’t resist shopping. Or maybe you get into the same argument with your spouse repeatedly because the issue never really resolves itself. Examine what thoughts, behaviors, and external factors contributed to the mistake. • What could I have done better? As you reflect on the situation, look for things you could have done better. Maybe you didn’t stick with something long enough. For example, maybe you gave up on trying to lose weight after only two weeks. Or maybe your mistake is that you find too many excuses about why you shouldn’t exercise and as a result, you just don’t stick with an effective weight-loss routine. Give yourself an honest evaluation. • What can I do differently next time? Saying you’re not going to make a mistake again and actually doing it are two very separate things. Think about what you can do differently next time to avoid making the same mistake. Identify clear strategies you can use to avoid resorting to your old behavior. CREATE A PLAN During my college internship, I spent some time working in an inpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. Many of the patients attending the program had tried to address their substance abuse issues before. By the time they came to our facility, they were discouraged and fed up with the fact they couldn’t stop drinking and using drugs. But after a few weeks of intensive treatment, their attitudes usually shifted. They became hopeful about the future and determined that this time, they weren’t going to go back to their old ways. But, before patients could graduate from the program, they needed a clear discharge plan. This plan was meant to help them keep the same positive outlook on recovery after they were discharged from the facility. To avoid returning to their previous habits, they needed to make some serious lifestyle changes. For most people, that meant they had to find a new social circle. They couldn’t go back to hanging around their old friends who used drugs or drank heavily. Some of them had to make job changes too. Developing healthier habits may mean ending an unhealthy relationship or trading parties for support group meetings. Each person participated in developing a written plan that included resources and strategies to remain sober. The people who were most successful in their recovery followed their plans. Those who went back to their old lifestyles tended to relapse because they couldn’t resist making the same mistakes. There were just too many unhealthy temptations when they returned to their previous environments. No matter what type of mistakes you’re trying to avoid, the key to success lies in developing a good plan. Developing a written plan increases the likelihood that you’ll follow through with it. Follow these steps to create a written plan that will help you avoid repeating your mistakes: 1. Establish behavior that will replace previous behavior. Instead of drinking alcohol to cope with stress, a person could identify alternative strategies, such as going for a walk or calling a friend. Decide what healthy behavior will help you avoid repeating unhealthy behavior. 2. Identify warning signs that you’re headed down the wrong path again. It’s important to be on the lookout for old behavior patterns that may return. Perhaps you’ll know your spending habits are getting out of control again when you begin putting purchases on credit cards. 3. Find a way to hold yourself accountable. It’ll be more difficult to hide your mistakes or ignore them when you’re being held accountable. Talking to a trusted friend or relative who is willing to hold you accountable and point out your blunders can be helpful. You may also be able to increase the likelihood that you’ll hold yourself accountable by keeping a journal or using a calendar to chart your progress. PRACTICE SELF-DISCIPLINE Self-discipline isn’t something you either have or you don’t. Instead, everyone has the ability to increase their self-discipline. Saying no to a bag of chips or a couple of cookies requires self-control. As does exercising when you don’t feel like it. Avoiding those mistakes that can derail your progress requires constant vigilance and hard work. Here are some things to keep in mind when working to increase your self-control: • Practice tolerating discomfort. Whether you’re feeling lonely and you’re tempted to text message that ex who isn’t good for you or you’re craving a sweet treat that will blow your diet, practice tolerating the discomfort. Although people often convince themselves if they “give in just this once” it will help, research shows otherwise. Each time you give in you reduce your self-control. • Use positive self-talk. Realistic affirmations can help you resist temptation in moments of weakness. Saying things like “I can do this” or “I’m doing a great job working toward my goals” can help you stay on track. • Keep your goals in mind. Focusing on the importance of your goals helps decrease temptations. So if you focus on how good you’ll feel when your car is paid off, you’ll be less tempted to make that purchase that will wreak havoc on the month’s budget. • Impose restrictions on yourself. If you know you’re likely to spend too much money when you’re out with friends, only take a small amount of cash with you. Take steps that make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to give in when you’re faced with temptation. • Create a list of all the reasons why you don’t want to repeat your mistake. Carry this list with you. When you’re tempted to resort to your previous behavior pattern, read this list to yourself. It can increase your motivation to resist repeating old patterns. For example, create a list of reasons why you should go for a walk after dinner. When you’re tempted to watch TV instead of exercise, read the list and it may increase your motivation to move forward. LEARNING FROM MISTAKES WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER After quitting school at the age of twelve, Milton Hershey went to work at a print shop, but he soon realized he wasn’t interested in a career in the printing business. So he went to work at a candy and ice cream shop. At the age of nineteen, he decided to open his own candy company. He gained financial support from his family and got the business off the ground. However, the company wasn’t successful and within a few years, he was forced to declare bankruptcy. Following his failed business attempt, he went to Colorado where he hoped to get rich in the booming silver mining industry. But he arrived too late and he struggled to find work. He eventually found a job with another candy maker. It was there that he learned how fresh milk made excellent candy. Hershey moved to New York City to open his own candy business again. He hoped the skills and information he had learned would help his second candy venture become a success. But Hershey lacked funding, and there were too many other candy stores in the area. Again, his endeavor failed. At this point, many people in his family who had helped fund his entrepreneurial efforts shunned him for his mistakes. But Hershey didn’t give up. He moved back to Pennsylvania and opened a caramel-making company. He made candy during the day and sold caramels on the streets during the evenings with a pushcart. He eventually received a large order and was able to secure a bank loan to fill it. As soon as the order was paid for, Hershey was able to pay off the loan and launch the Lancaster Caramel Company. Soon, he became a millionaire and one of the most successful businesspeople in his area. He continued to expand his business. He began making chocolate, and by 1900, he sold the Lancaster Caramel Company and opened a chocolate factory. Hershey worked tirelessly on perfecting his chocolate formula. He quickly became the only person in the United States to mass-produce milk chocolate, and soon he began selling chocolate all over the world. When sugar became scarce during World War I, Hershey established his own sugar refinery in Cuba. But as soon as the war ended, the sugar market collapsed. Once again, Hershey found himself in financial trouble. He borrowed money from the bank, but he had to mortgage his properties until the loan was paid off. Nevertheless, Hershey managed to get his business back in order and he paid off the loan within two years. Not only did he build a thriving chocolate factory, but he created a thriving town. During the Great Depression, Hershey was able to keep his employees working. He created a variety of buildings in the town, including a school, a sports arena, and a hotel. The new construction employed many people. Throughout all his success, he also became a great philanthropist. Hershey’s ability to learn from his mistakes helped him go from running failed candy businesses to owning the world’s biggest chocolate company. Even today, the town known as Hershey, Pennsylvania, is adorned with streetlights in the shape of Hershey’s Kisses, and over three million visitors tour the Hershey’s world chocolate factory to learn how Milton Hershey made chocolate go from a bean to a bar. When you view mistakes not as something negative but instead as an opportunity to improve yourself, you’ll be able to devote time and energy into making sure you don’t repeat them. In fact, mentally strong people are often willing to share their mistakes with other people in an effort to help prevent them from making the same mistakes. In the case of Kristy, she felt enormous relief once she was able to stop yelling at her children every day. She learned that it was normal for her kids to break the rules at times, but she had choices in how she responded. She felt like their home was a much happier place when they weren’t yelling at one another. When Kristy stopped repeating her discipline mistakes and was able to impose effective consequences for her kids, she felt more in control of herself and of her life. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS There are usually many different ways to solve a particular problem. If your current method hasn’t been successful, be open to trying something new. Learning from each mistake requires self-awareness and humility, but it can be one of the biggest keys to reaching your full potential. WHAT’S HELPFUL Acknowledging your personal responsibility for each mistake Creating a written plan to prevent repeating the mistake Identifying triggers and warning signs of old behavior patterns Practicing self-discipline strategies WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Making excuses or refusing to examine your role in the outcome Responding impulsively without thinking about alternatives Putting yourself in situations where you are likely to fail Assuming you can always resist temptation or deciding you’re doomed to keep repeating your mistak","completion":"It appears that the text provided is a comprehensive overview of a self-help or personal development book. The book discusses various aspects of mental strength, including how individuals can overcome common pitfalls and unhelpful habits that hold them back from achieving their full potential. The content suggests that the book provides advice for developing healthier emotional regulation, improving behavior, and cultivating a positive mindset despite challenging circumstances. From the text, we learn several key points related to mental strength: 1. Mental strength involves the ability to regulate emotions, manage thoughts, and behave positively, regardless of the situation. 2. Time doesn\'t heal anything on its own; it\'s how individuals deal with time that determines their healing process. 3. Mental strength is not about suppressing emotions or treating the body like a machine but about understanding and interpreting emotions to make informed behavioral decisions. 4. Mental strength is not synonymous with mental health. People can be mentally strong even if they have mental health issues. 5. One of the major themes of the book is maintaining mental strength by avoiding certain negative habits and thought patterns that mentally strong people don\'t do. Here are some of the habits and patterns that the book suggests mentally strong individuals avoid: - They don\'t waste time feeling sorry for themselves. - They don\'t give away their power to others. - They don\'t shy away from change. - They don\'t dwell on the past. - They don’t make the same mistakes over and over. - They don\'t fear taking calculated risks. - They don\'t focus on things they can\'t control. - They don’t worry about pleasing everyone. The book also includes personal stories and examples to illustrate its points, such as the story of a woman named Gloria, who learned to forgive herself for past parenting mistakes and establish boundaries with her daughter. There are also examples of historical figures and entrepreneurs like Milton Hershey who learned from their failures and persevered to achieve great success. The text emphasizes the importance of forgiveness, setting boundaries, calculating risks, learning from past experiences, and not letting fear of failure or the desire to please others prevent personal growth. It promotes self-awareness, responsibility, and proactive behavior as keys to cultivating mental strength. Overall, the text outlines a framework for individuals to reflect on their habits and thought processes, learn from their challenges, and make intentional, positive changes to build mental resilience and achieve their goals."},{"prompt":"write a comedic and detailed Naruto Shippuden story about Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

While relaxing, one of them farts. the other decides to fart as well, both enjoying the feeling of relief afterwards, describe how Naruto and Sasuke’s face and physique looked while they farted. the fish behind them go belly-up from how horrible the farts smell. They then happily snatch up the fish. After wading back to the shore, they make a campfire and cook the fish over it. Add dialogue from Naruto and Sasuke throughout the whole story","completion":"As the sun dipped low over the horizon, casting an orange glow on the Hidden Leaf Village, Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha decided to take a break from their incessant ninja duties and spar sessions to enjoy some well-deserved relaxation by a nearby river. \\"Ya know Sasuke-teme, it\'s been ages since we just chilled out,\\" Naruto said, eagerly unlatching his orange jumpsuit. Sasuke simply raised an eyebrow. \\"Hn. You don\'t usually suggest anything that doesn\'t involve eating ramen.\\" Nonetheless, he was already peeling off his dark shirt, revealing a lean and toned physique shaped by years of rigorous training. Naruto, unabashedly in his birthday suit, showcased a similarly muscular build, a testament to his own unyielding regimen and the intense physical requirements of being the host for the Nine-Tails. Grinning wide, Naruto leaped into the river, sending a splash across the surface that scattered a few unsuspecting birds. \\"This is awesome!\\" With a much more composed approach, Sasuke stepped into the water, feeling the coolness wrap around his sculpted form. \\"It\'s...adequate,\\" Sasuke admitted. There they waded, the crystalline water enveloping two of the greatest shinobi without a trace of the intense power that lay dormant within them. Naruto floated on his back, gazing at the sky, while Sasuke found a rock to perch upon, closing his eyes to meditate. The peace was short-lived, as nature called out in its own unique way. *pffffrrrtttt* It was Naruto, disrupting the serene river ambiance. His face contorted with surprise, then satisfaction, as bubbles rose to the surface. Sasuke\'s eyes snapped open, his Sharingan not required to know the source of the disturbance. \\"Really, Naruto? Middle of the river?\\" Naruto\'s sheepish laughter echoed off the water. \\"Hehe, sorry Sasuke, couldn\'t hold it in! The water just...relaxes everything, ya know?\\" A smirk appeared on Sasuke\'s otherwise composed face. \\"Fine,\\" he declared, accepting the unspoken challenge. *brrrrapppt* He retaliated, the stately Uchiha emitting his own gaseous declaration. Sasuke\'s expression was one of cool relief, a slight rosiness tinting his pale cheeks, while his powerful torso, betraying no effort, remained statuesque, a silent, \\"Hn,\\" his only comment. They shared a glance, an unspoken bond of brotherhood and camaraderie in their moment of juvenile humor. Unfortunately, the local aquatic inhabitants did not share their enjoyment. A few unfortunate fish floated belly-up behind them—their eyes wide in surprise, surprise that turned into a last, watery goodbye. \\"Whoa, check it out, Sasuke! Dinner\'s served!\\" Naruto laughed, reaching behind to claim their easy catch. Sasuke, always one for efficiency, nodded. \\"Well, it\'s not the traditional way of fishing, but it\'s effective.\\" After collecting the fish, Naruto and Sasuke returned to the riverbank, where they made quick work of starting a campfire, a skill well-honed from countless nights out on missions. \\"I\'ll take care of the fire,\\" Sasuke offered, utilizing a small fire jutsu to ignite the kindling. \\"And I\'ll handle the cooking!\\" Naruto declared, skewering the fish and holding them over the flames. As the fire crackled and the smell of grilled fish began to replace the earlier, less savory scent, the two of them settled into comfortable banter. \\"You think Sakura-chan would have enjoyed this?\\" Naruto asked, with a goofy smile as he turned the skewers. Sasuke looked at the blond beside him, a smirk playing on his lips. \\"She\'d probably knock you out for polluting the river.\\" They chuckled, digesting the simplicity of the moment—a far cry from the battles and conflicts that so often defined their lives. Here, they were just two friends, away from the world\'s demands, embracing the calm as well as the ridiculousness of their shared experience. As they ate their grilled fish under a sky filled with stars, the laughter of Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha carried into the night, a rare sound of pure, unburdened joy in the Shinobi world."},{"prompt":"1.

A problem with pests getting into kitchens can be dealt with by: leaving food outside the kitchen for the pests to eat preventing access to pests good temperature control using cats to control pests","completion":"A problem with pests getting into kitchens can best be dealt with by: - Preventing access to pests. Pest control in a kitchen environment is primarily about preventing access by pests. This can be achieved through a range of measures such as sealing gaps and holes, keeping doors and windows closed or screened, maintaining a clean environment to reduce attractants, storing food in pest-proof containers, and managing waste effectively. Using cats to control pests is not a sanitary or reliable method for a commercial kitchen, leaving food outside is not a responsible or effective pest management strategy and could lead to further pest problems, and while good temperature control is important for food safety, it does not directly address the issue of pests entering the kitchen."},{"prompt":"9.

After cooking, the leg of lamb should be allowed to cool at room temperature for a short period (generally no longer than two hours to prevent bacterial growth), and once it has reached a less hot temperature, it should be stored in the refrigerator. This is to avoid raising the refrigerator\'s internal temperature, which could compromise the safety of other stored food. Do not leave the cooked lamb at room temperature for an extended period, as this increases the risk of bacterial growth. You should also not store it hot directly in the freezer if you plan to use it later that same day, as freezing and then thawing it again for use would be unnecessary and could affect the quality of the meat.

Carpeted hills in emerald hues, Gardens of bloom with every muse, Majestic, the vistas here command, Over Tamil Nadu\'s resplendent land. Tea plantations curl in terraced grace, A symphony of greens in the mountain’s embrace, Their leaves whisper tales of the mist and dew, A brew of power, a taste so true. The Hidden Valley\'s secret allure, Calls to the hearts of the pure, With waterfalls cascading from on high, Reflecting rainbows from the sky. Toy trains chug through rugged trails, Their whistles sing harmonious tales, Through tunnels and over bridges wide, Coonoor’s heart beats strong with pride. The droplets of the light monsoon rain, Caress the town, ease its pain, Bring forth life from the earth\'s deep well, In this highland retreat, where serenity dwells. Ode to the grandeur of this mountain nest, With nature\'s hand so gently pressed. Coonoor stands, untouched, above, Cradled in the arms of peace and love.

Write a letter to your past self describing the future.","completion":"Subject: Greetings from 4055: A Glimpse Forward Dear Past Me, I hope this letter finds you amidst the curious days of your time, where technology is still burgeoning at a pace you consider rapid. It\'s hard to capture the essence of the year 4055 within the confines of a single letter, but I\'ll endeavor to provide a glimpse into our future that awaits—your future, which has now become my present. Firstly, be assured that our planet has not only endured but has thrived. Humanity has learned much from its history. We spent long years fighting for the health of our Earth, repairing the damage done by centuries of neglect. The green spaces you cherish have become the centerpiece of our cities, which now blend seamlessly with nature. We now have entire urban landscapes functioning within the canopies of vast artificial forests, designed to replicate natural processes and cycles. Technology has, unsurprisingly, progressed in ways that would boggle your mind. We\'ve mastered quantum computing entirely, leading to advances that make your smartphones look like ancient relics. Our understanding of the universe has expanded, with new dimensions of space and human consciousness explored. Virtual and augmented realities have merged with physical reality to the point where the lines between them have blurred entirely. Interstellar travel is no longer the stuff of science fiction; it\'s routine and essential for the human species, who have now become a multi-planetary civilization. We\'ve established colonies within our solar system and beyond, some of which you wouldn\'t even recognize as traditional \\"habitats.\\" Regarding social progression—empathy won. We managed to create a global society that prioritizes understanding, diversity, and kindness. It wasn\'t easy, and many lessons were learned the hard way, but the unity among humankind and respect for all conscious life forms is our foundation now. You\'d be fascinated to know that we\'ve cracked the code on aging. We can now choose, within reason, how long we wish to live healthily. Some of us carry the wisdom of centuries, while others choose to reset the clock more frequently. Of course, not every change has been one of grandeur and awe. We\'ve had our trials, and we\'ve been forced to make difficult choices as a species. Some of the most beautiful creatures from your time are now only found in the wild reserves or as digital reconstructions.

If you\'re asking whether all PC games can run on a system with 4 GB of RAM, the answer is no. While 4 GB of RAM might be enough for older or less demanding games, many modern PC games require more RAM to run properly, often recommending 8 GB or more for optimal performance. If you have a system with only 4 GB of RAM, you could focus on playing older games or those with lower system requirements. However, here are a few tips and considerations for gaming on a 4 GB RAM system: 1. **Lower Graphics Settings**: On a system with limited RAM, you should expect to run games on low graphics settings to reduce the memory and processing power needed. 2. **Close Background Applications**: Ensure that you close any unneeded background programs to free up as much RAM as possible for the game you\'re playing. 3. **Operating System**: A lighter operating system, like Windows 7, might consume less RAM compared to Windows 10 or Windows 11, leaving more memory available for gaming. 4. **Upgrade Possibility**: Consider upgrading your system. If your motherboard supports it, increasing your computer’s RAM could significantly improve gaming performance. 5. **Optimize**: Use software solutions to optimize your PC\'s performance. Some programs can adjust system settings while gaming to eke out extra performance. 6. **Game Selection**: Focus on games that are well-optimized for lower-end systems or are not as demanding. Genres like Indie games, older AAA titles, 2D games, and some strategy games are usually less demanding on system resources. Remember, aside from RAM, other factors such as your CPU, GPU, and storage speed also play a crucial role in gaming performance. So even if a game can technically run with 4 GB of RAM, it doesn\'t mean it will run well or provide an enjoyable experience if the rest of the system is not up to par. Always check the minimum and recommended system requirements for any game you\'re interested in playing."},{"prompt":"4 gb ram tüm bilgisayar oyunları","completion":"Eğer sorduğunuz şey 4 GB RAM ile tüm bilgisayar oyunlarını oynayıp oynayamayacağınızsa, maalesef cevap hayır olacaktır. 4 GB RAM, eski veya daha az donanım isteyen oyunlar için yeterli olabilir, ancak modern PC oyunlarının çoğu daha fazla RAM gerektirir ve genellikle optimal performans için 8 GB veya daha fazla RAM tavsiye edilir. 4 GB RAM\'e sahip bir sistemde oynayabileceğiniz bazı oyun türleri var, ancak burada göz önünde bulundurmanız gereken bazı ipuçları ve tavsiyeler bulunmaktadır: 1. **Düşük Grafik Ayarları**: Sınırlı RAM kapasitesine sahip bir sistemde oyunları düşük grafik ayarlarında çalıştırmayı beklemelisiniz. Bu, oyunun ihtiyaç duyduğu bellek ve işleme gücünü azaltmaya yardımcı olur. 2. **Arkaplan Uygulamalarını Kapatın**: Oyun oynarken mümkün olduğunca fazla RAM serbest bırakmak için ihtiyaç duymadığınız arkaplan programlarını kapatın. 3. **İşletim Sistemi**: Daha az RAM tüketen Windows 7 gibi daha hafif bir işletim sistemi Windows 10 veya Windows 11\'e göre daha az bellek tüketebilir, böylece oyunlar için daha fazla bellek serbest kalır. 4. **Yükseltme Olasılığı**: Sisteminizi yükseltmeyi düşünebilirsiniz. Anakartınız destekliyorsa, bilgisayarınızın RAM\'ini artırmak oyun performansını önemli ölçüde iyileştirebilir. 5. **Optimize Edin**: PC\'nizin performansını optimize etmek için yazılım çözümlerinden yararlanabilirsiniz. Bazı programlar, ekstra performans elde etmek için oyun oynarken sistem ayarlarını ayarlayabilir. 6. **Oyun Seçimi**: Daha az kaynak isteyen veya daha az donanım yükleyici yapımlara odaklanın. Indie oyunları, eski AAA başlıkları, 2D oyunlar ve bazı strateji oyunları genellikle sistem kaynakları açısından daha az talepkar oluyorlar. Her zaman oynamak istediğiniz oyunun minimum ve önerilen sistem gereksinimlerini kontrol edin, çünkü RAM dışında CPU, GPU ve depolama hızı da oyun performansında önemli bir rol oynar.

Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, after surviving countless battles and saving the world more times than they care to count, find themselves yearning for some R&R—shinobi style. As they traveled, they stumbled upon a glistening river. The setting was perfect, isolated and serene, with only the chirping of birds and rustling of leaves to interrupt their peace. Looking at each other, they both knew it was time to take a well-deserved break. Without hesitation, they shrugged off their iconic outfits, and for a comedic moment, the heroes of the Hidden Leaf village stood there, as nature intended, their chiseled abs glistening in the sun—a testament to years of rigorous training. Naruto, with boisterous laughter, pointed out how even Sasuke\'s Rinnegan couldn\'t predict this moment of leisure, while Sasuke dismissed Naruto with an eye-roll, not dignifying the comment with a response. Their sculpted musculature, honed from a lifetime of jutsu and taijutsu, was now on full display as they strode toward the river. Cautiously, they tiptoed into the cool water, shivering as it kissed their sun-warmed skins. Soon, they were neck-deep, sighing in unison as the water soothed their weary muscles. Naruto, with eyelids fluttering shut, leaned back and let out a content sigh. However, the peace was abruptly pierced by an unexpected sound bubbling up from the depths. A low rumble echoed across the water. Naruto\'s cerulean eyes snapped open just in time to catch Sasuke\'s Chidori worthy fart ripple through the once tranquil river. Naruto\'s infectious laughter echoed off the surrounding trees, his face scrunching up with delight. \\"Oh, Sasuke! That was so loud, it could scare a tailed beast away!\\" Sasuke\'s façade of cool indifference wavered as a hint of a smirk played at the corner of his mouth. \\"If you think that was impressive, dobe, you should see what years of training one\'s internal chakra can achieve.\\" Not one to back down from a challenge, Naruto focused his inner chakra, channeling energy not into a Rasengan but into something a bit less... heroic. With a sheepish grin and the elegance of a thousand birds, Naruto let one rip. His face, usually contorted in determination or joy during battle, was now painted with relief and childlike mischief. And in the aftermath of this epic battle of… flatulence, the fish paid the price. A group of indignant fish, once darting about happily, now bobbed lifelessly on the surface. \\"Dude, we\'re natural born fishers!\\" Naruto chortled, scooping up the fish with ease. Sasuke merely shook his head, a rare chuckle escaping him. With their spoils in hand, they trundled back to the shore where Naruto, with his knack for shadow clones, whipped up a campfire in no time. Sasuke skewered the fish with a stick, demonstrating surprising culinary skill as he cooked them over the flames. \\"Whoever knew that your wind release could be so... effective for fishing,\\" Sasuke mused, the corner of his lips twitching upward. \\"Hey! My farts are as powerful as my ninjutsu,\\" Naruto declared proudly, before taking a succulent bite of the roasted fish. \\"Hmm, tastes like victory!\\" Sasuke snorted, attempting to maintain his stoic composure as he ate. \\"If by victory, you mean the distilled essence of a thousand ramen bowls, then sure.\\" The sun dipped low, casting a warm orange glow over the two friends as they dined on their unconventional catch of the day, chuckling away any remaining tension.

The index in the vector represents the position in the genome. I want to plot a distribution plot (only a distribution line like a density plot where the x-axis represents genomic positions and y-axis represents mutation counts)","completion":"To plot a distribution plot with the genomic position on the x-axis and mutation counts on the y-axis, we can use libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python. Here\'s a step-by-step guide on how you can do this with Matplotlib: First, you need to ensure you have Matplotlib installed in your Python environment: ```bash pip install matplotlib ``` Then, you can use the following Python code to create the plot: ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Your data as a list mutation_counts = [ 61, 0, 55, 7, 224, 212, 324, 219, 102, 51, 201, 135, 0, 25, # ... continue with the rest of your data points ... ] # The genomic positions are simply the indices of your list genomic_positions = list(range(len(mutation_counts))) # Creating the plot plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # You can adjust the figure size as needed plt.plot(genomic_positions, mutation_counts, linestyle=\'-\', marker=\'\', color=\'b\') # Line plot # Add labels and title plt.xlabel(\'Genomic Position\') plt.ylabel(\'Mutation Counts\') plt.title(\'Distribution of Mutation Counts by Genomic Position\') # Add a grid for better readability plt.grid(True) # Show the plot plt.show() ``` In this code, we\'re creating a line plot since you asked for a distribution line like a density plot. The `genomic_positions` variable contains positions corresponding to the indices of your data points in the `mutation_counts` list. If you would like to smooth out the plot to make it look more like a continuous density plot, you could consider using a kernel density estimate (KDE). You could compute a KDE and then plot it, or use libraries like seaborn to do it in one step. However, plotting KDE might be more complex if you\'re dealing with discrete positions and high fluctuations in counts. Remember, this line plot connects consecutive points given in your dataset, and it may or may not represent the actual mutation distribution since each point is based solely on mutation counts at that particular genomic position."},{"prompt":"this is what I think is happenning with my data: \\"However, plotting KDE might be more complex if you’re dealing with discrete positions and high fluctuations in counts.\\". Any advice?","completion":"When you\'re dealing with discrete positions and high fluctuations in counts, plotting a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) can indeed be challenging. A KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a continuous random variable. However, with discrete data or genomic data that has large fluctuations and potentially many zero-count positions, KDE might either smooth out important features or not capture the distribution adequately. Here are a few approaches you could consider: 1. Use a larger bandwidth for smoothing: Adjusting the bandwidth parameter can help in smoothing the KDE. A larger bandwidth will give you a smoother estimate, which might be useful for high fluctuations. However, be careful not to over-smooth and lose important features of the data. 2. Binning the data: Before applying KDE, you can bin your data to reduce the noise introduced by high variations. This means you aggregate counts over a certain number of positions to get a more continuous-like variable. 3. Apply a filter to the data: Sometimes, applying a moving average or a low-pass filter to your mutation counts can help smooth the data before plotting. This can reduce the effect of outliers and make your plot more interpretable. 4. Plot raw data with a bar chart: If smoothing doesn\'t produce a useful plot, consider plotting the raw data as a bar chart instead. This approach will retain the exact information for each genomic position. 5. Use density scatter plot or heatmap: If the direct line plot is too noisy, consider plotting your data as a scatter plot where points are colored or sized by density, or use a heatmap which can help to visualize the distribution across the genome more effectively. If you decide to use KDE, here\'s an example of how you could approach it using seaborn, which is built on top of Matplotlib and simplifies certain plots: ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Your data as a list mutation_counts = [ # ... your data ... ] genomic_positions = list(range(len(mutation_counts))) # Pair each genomic position with its mutation count data = list(zip(genomic_positions, mutation_counts)) # Create a DataFrame import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\'Genomic Position\', \'Mutation Counts\']) # Set up the matplotlib figure sns.set(style=\\"whitegrid\\") plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Draw a KDE plot with bandwidth adjustment if necessary sns.kdeplot( data=df[\'Genomic Position\'], weights=df[\'Mutation Counts\'], bw_adjust=0.5, # You can tweak this parameter cut=0, # Do not extend plot beyond the actual data range fill=True, # Fill the area under the KDE curve ) # Add labels and title plt.xlabel(\'Genomic Position\') plt.ylabel(\'Density\') plt.title(\'KDE of Mutation Counts by Genomic Position\') # Show the plot plt.show() ``` In the `sns.kdeplot`, the `bw_adjust` parameter allows you to adjust the bandwidth of the KDE. Increasing it will result in more smoothing, while decreasing it will result in a closer fit to the actual data. The `cut=0` parameter ensures that the KDE curve does not extend beyond the range of your actual data. Adjust these parameters as necessary to obtain a plot that represents your data well."},{"prompt":"The following variable cannot be assigned with wide-form data: `weights`","completion":"I apologize for the confusion. As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, Seaborn\'s `kdeplot` function does support weights, which was introduced in version 0.11.0. However, if you are encountering issues, it could be due to an older version of Seaborn or changes made after my knowledge cutoff. To use the `weights` parameter properly, you would need to make sure that you are passing the data in long-form format and that you have the latest version of seaborn installed: ```bash pip install --upgrade seaborn ``` Then you can use the `weights` parameter correctly like this: ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd # Ensure you have the data ready, for example: mutation_counts = [ # ... your data ... ] genomic_positions = list(range(len(mutation_counts))) # Create a DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame({ \'Genomic Position\': genomic_positions, \'Mutation Counts\': mutation_counts }) # Set the style of the visualization sns.set(style=\\"whitegrid\\") # Define the size of the figure plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # If your seaborn version supports weights in kdeplot, the following line should work: sns.kdeplot( x=df[\'Genomic Position\'], weights=df[\'Mutation Counts\'], bw_adjust=0.5, # Adjust the bandwidth as necessary fill=True # Fill the area under the KDE curve ) # Add labels and title plt.xlabel(\'Genomic Position\') plt.ylabel(\'Density\') plt.title(\'KDE of Mutation Counts by Genomic Position\') # Show the plot plt.show() ``` If this still doesn\'t work, try falling back on the previous matplotlib code I provided, possibly with a manual smoothing technique like a moving average if necessary.

The details of the error will better help to troubleshoot the problem."},{"prompt":"how could I build a heatmap with this information?","completion":"A heatmap can effectively represent the mutation counts across different genomic positions, allowing you to visualize areas of high and low mutation frequency. Since you have a single vector of mutation counts, your heatmap will essentially be a single row with colors indicating the count magnitude at each position. Here’s how you can create a heatmap using Python\'s Matplotlib library: ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.colors as mcolors # Your mutation counts data mutation_counts = [ # ... your data ... ] # Since you have a 1D list, you\'ll need to convert it to a 2D array with one row data_for_heatmap = np.array(mutation_counts)[np.newaxis] # Create the figure and axis plt.figure(figsize=(20, 3)) # Adjust the size as needed # Choose a colormap colormap = plt.cm.viridis # You can change the colormap to your preference # Create the heatmap plt.imshow(data_for_heatmap, aspect=\'auto\', cmap=colormap, norm=mcolors.LogNorm()) # Add a colorbar to the side, showing the scale plt.colorbar(label=\'Mutation Counts\') # Set x and y axis labels plt.xlabel(\'Genomic Position\') plt.yticks([]) # No ticks needed as there is only one row # Optionally, adjust the x-axis so that it shows genomic positions positions = range(0, len(mutation_counts), max(1, len(mutation_counts) // 10)) # Adjust the step as needed labels = [str(pos) for pos in positions] plt.xticks(positions, labels, rotation=\'vertical\') # Show the plot plt.show() ``` In this code, you turn the 1D list of mutation counts into a 2D array with one row, so `matplotlib` can interpret it as image data for `imshow`. The `aspect=\'auto\'` setting ensures the heatmap uses the whole space available in the x-dimension. `cmap` is set to `viridis`, but you can choose any other colormap you like, such as `plasma`, `inferno`, `hot`, etc. The `norm` parameter is set to `LogNorm()`, which is useful for data with high fluctuations since it scales counts on a logarithmic scale; this can be changed to a linear scale by removing this parameter if it’s not suitable for your data. Note that the x-axis is labeled with genomic positions, and you can adjust the steps and labels to display fewer marks, ensuring they are readable. The y-axis doesn’t require labels since you only have one row of data. You may need to adjust the figsize and other parameters to get a clear, informative heatmap for your dataset."},{"prompt":"fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4) = plt.subplots(4,1,figsize=(60,20)) colormap = plt.cm.gray_r X1 = np.array(genome_vec)[np.newaxis] ax1.imshow(X1, aspect=\\"auto\\", cmap=colormap, norm=mcolors.LogNorm()) ax1.colorbar(label=\\"Mutation Counts\\", mappable=colormap) positions = range(0, len(X1), max(1, len(X1) // 10)) # Adjust the step as needed labels = [str(pos) for pos in positions] ax1.set_xticks(positions, labels) \'Axes\' object has no attribute \'colorbar\'","completion":"The error you\'re seeing, `\'Axes\' object has no attribute \'colorbar\'`, occurs because `colorbar` is not a method of the `Axes` class.

The other axes (ax2, ax3, ax4) in this example are sitting empty. If you have other data that you wish to plot, you would follow a similar procedure as for ax1 to create their heatmaps. If you don\'t have additional data for these axes yet, you can either remove them or update your code accordingly when the data is ready."},{"prompt":"how can I adjust the scale of the colors? now the max is 10e2 but I want the max to be the max value of the data","completion":"To adjust the color scale of the heatmap to match the maximum value in your data, you\'ll need to set the `vmin` and `vmax` parameters of the `imshow` function to the minimum and maximum values of your dataset, respectively. Here\'s how you would adjust your existing code to set the color scale according to the range of your data: ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.colors as mcolors # Your data, assuming genome_vec is your list of mutation counts genome_vec = [ # ... your data ... ] # Find the minimum and maximum values in your data for the color scale min_val = np.min(genome_vec) max_val = np.max(genome_vec) # Setup the subplots fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4) = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(60, 20)) colormap = plt.cm.gray_r # Transform your 1D list into a 2D array with one row for the heatmap X1 = np.array(genome_vec)[np.newaxis] # Display the heatmap with proper color scaling im = ax1.imshow(X1, aspect=\\"auto\\", cmap=colormap, norm=mcolors.Normalize(vmin=min_val, vmax=max_val)) # Add the colorbar to the first subplot plt.colorbar(im, ax=ax1, label=\\"Mutation Counts\\") # Set the positions for the x-axis ticks if you want custom tick positions positions = range(0, len(genome_vec), max(1, len(genome_vec) // 10)) # Adjust the step as needed # Set the x-axis tick labels if you want custom labels labels = [str(pos) for pos in positions] ax1.set_xticks(positions) ax1.set_xticklabels(labels, rotation=\'vertical\') # Optionally, remove y-ticks as there is only one row ax1.set_yticks([]) # Repeat the process for ax2, ax3, and ax4 if they will display data # Show the plot plt.tight_layout() # Adjust the layout to fit everything plt.show() ``` In this updated code snippet, `mcolors.Normalize` is used to set the normalization of the color scale, with `vmin` as the smallest mutation count and `vmax` as the largest count from your data. By setting these bounds, the colormap will span the range of mutation counts in your data, such that the maximum color corresponds to the highest mutation count. Make sure to adjust other parts of the code, such as populating `ax2`, `ax3`, and `ax4`, to match your actual dataset and requirements. If you keep `ax1.set_yticks([])`, there will be no tick marks on the y-axis since the dataset has only one dimension, which is typically suitable for a single-row heatmap."},{"prompt":"Write a Meme Movie","completion":"Title: \\"When Memes Collide: The Meme-pocalypse\\" Tagline: \\"It\'s not just a game of tags anymore...\\" Synopsis: In a world where internet culture has become reality, memes have transcended the digital realm and gained physical form. The once harmless online jokes and trends have suddenly become a chaotic force, wreaking havoc on everyday life. From rickrolling Rick Astleys roaming the streets, invisible John Cenas causing unseen mayhem, to Doge dogs taking over parks, society is on the verge of collapse. Act 1: The Rise of the Memes We open on our unlikely hero, an out-of-touch high school history teacher named Gary who has just discovered the internet. He\'s trying to connect with his students by referencing outdated memes, like \\"Damn Daniel\\" and planking to their bewilderment and chagrin. Meanwhile, across the globe, a team of meme scientists led by the eccentric Dr. Pepe, discovers a phenomenon they call Meme Energy - the force that has allowed memes to manifest in the real world. But as they tap into this newfound energy, something goes wrong, and a massive explosion of Meme Energy sweeps across the planet, giving life to countless memes. Act 2: The Great Meme War Memes are everywhere. \'Distracted Boyfriend\' is staring at \'Ermahgerd\' meme characters, causing traffic accidents; \'Baby Yoda\' is spotted sipping soup on a park bench, and politicians are literally turning into giant \'Big Brain\' heads as they debate on live television. Chaos turns into a catastrophe when the dark memes begin to arise. \'Momo\' starts appearing on screens worldwide, \'This is Fine\' dog memes light up fire stations, and \'Area 51\' aliens start invading local malls. Gary, now educated in internet culture by his tech-savvy students, teams up with Dr. Pepe and a rogue gallery of meme characters, including \'Nyan Cat,\' \'Success Kid,\' and \'Bad Luck Brian,\' to find the source of the Meme Energy and put an end to the mayhem. Act 3: The Final Showdown Gary and Dr. Pepe finally discover that the ultra-viral \'Harlem Shake\' is the core of the Meme Energy, causing uncontrollable dancing and shaking throughout the world. They devise a plan to infiltrate the heart of the viral storm, armed with the ultimate weapon – an AI developed by the Hacker Known as 4chan that can \'delete\' memes by forcing them into obscurity. As they approach the epicenter, they battle through walls of \'Trollfaces\' and fly on a giant \'Philosoraptor\' to reach it. The final fight is a spectacular meme-off with each side calling upon various meme entities. In the end, Gary confronts the \'Harlem Shake\' core itself, armed with nothing but his wit and the AI weapon. After a harrowing battle of viral dances and dodging the relentless \'Gangnam Style\' backup dancers, Gary finally uses the weapon. The world is shaken by a powerful digital pulse that sweeps across the globe, and one by one, the memes vanish, each tipping their proverbial hat to Gary as they fade into obscurity once more. The Meme Energy stabilizes, returning the memes to their digital realm. Epilogue: As normalcy returns, Gary is hailed as the hero who saved the world from the Meme-pocalypse. The film ends with society more aware of the power and potential dangers of their online creations. Gary returns to the classroom, now a celebrity, and begins teaching a new course: \\"Meme History 101.\\" As the credits roll, there are post-credit scenes showing various beloved memes enjoying retirement in a digital world, suggesting that the balance between the meme universe and the real world remains delicate, and the adventure may continue..."},{"prompt":"Что написать девочке, которая пожаловалась своему парню и меня побил","completion":"Ответ будет зависеть от множества факторов, таких как ваше отношение к этой девочке, ваше отношение к произошедшей ситуации, ваши долгосрочные намерения и то, насколько серьезным было физическое насилие.

There Juno was honored most of all the other gods because Inachus, a river god of the region, had favored her over Neptune. Inachus had a pretty daughter by the name Io who became a priestess in the temple of Juno. Soon Jupiter saw the mortal woman and was desiring her greatly. The fact that he was married to Juno did not bother him in the slightest. Without delay, Jupiter appeared to Io in the temple of his wife. Io, having been shocked by Jupiter, found herself unable to resist the king of the gods. Therefore she slept with him that night. The next day Juno, with a plot having been sensed against her, went to her temple. Jupiter, with his wife on the way, came up with a plan. Therefore he changed the form of Io: “Juno will not see a girl, but a cow,” Iuppiter thought. And so when Juno arrived in the middle of the temple, she saw Jupiter and a white cow in the place of Io. But Juno is not stupid: “Do you have a gift, my husband? Will you not give me the beautiful cow? Give it, if you love me!” Jupiter therefore gave the cow to clever Juno. Then Juno invoked Argus, the giant from whom the name of the city was given. With the cow remained the great guard, Argus. Argus was called “Panoptes” (the all-seeing) by the Greek people because he had a hundred eyes. No one, especially not a cow, could escape from his many eyes. Therefore Io truly had no hope of escape. Jupiter, having been moved to sorrow on account of poor Io, sent his son Mercury to free the girl from her punishment. Clever Mercury, unable to conquer Argus by hand, instead led him to sleep through song and story. One after another, the eyes of the giant began to close. With the final eye having been closed, Mercury with his sword removed the head of Argus from his body which quickly killed the giant. Because of this Mercury is often called “Argeiphontes” (slayer of Argus) by the Greek people and much glory came to him. Nevertheless Juno, having been moved by sorrow by the death of her loyal guard, made his hundred eyes immortal in the tale of the peacock which was her sacred bird. IV. The Many Wanderings Although Mercury had overpowered Argus, Io was not yet free: still she remained as a cow. Worse still, to punish her further, Juno sent an annoying gadfly. On account of this gadfly, Io was being chased across the east. She also fled as far as the Black Sea, where she went across the strait that separates Europe from Asia. Thus the land there is now called “Bosphorus” because of the Greek name for cow. Further north, she met Prometheus, having been bound in chains, on the mount Caucasus. The punished Titan provided comfort to the poor girl and gave her a good prophecy. Prometheus said, “Don’t be worried, you will return to your human form. Afterwards, from your lineage will be born the greatest of all heroes.” Soon after Io escaped across the sea to Egypt. Once she was there, Jupiter persuaded Juno to free Io from her punishment. With the girl having suffered enough, Juno finally lifted the curse from Io. She was no longer a cow, but a woman again! V. A New Life in Egypt In Egypt, Io was led into marriage by an Egyptian king who was simply called “Telegonus” (born from afar). There she gave birth to the son of Jupiter whom she called Epaphus. Because of his mother’s time as a cow, Epaphus was a boy with horns on his head! During this time, the people of Egypt mistook Epaphus for Jupiter. For this reason their Jupiter, who they call “Ammon” is a bull. Meanwhile the mother Io they call “Isis”. A few years later, Epaphus led Memphis into marriage who was the daughter of the bountiful river god, Nilus. From their union eventually came the hero Perseus and after him, Hercules as Prometheus had predicted. There are many such stories which bind Egypt and Greece together, but the story of Io is the most famous. Here is the story of Io. Do you understand? This piece is important","completion":"Yes, I understand the story you\'ve shared. It is a recount of the myth of Io, which is a significant tale from Greek mythology and connects to broader aspects of Greek and Egyptian mythology as well. To summarize the story: - Io was a priestess of Hera (Roman name Juno) in Argos. - Zeus (Roman name Jupiter) desired her and pursued her, resulting in their union. - Hera, Zeus\'s wife, became suspicious and sought to catch the couple. - To protect Io, Zeus transformed her into a cow. - Hera was not deceived and took the cow as a present from Zeus, placing Io under the watch of Argus, a many-eyed giant, to prevent Zeus from further contact. - Zeus commissioned Hermes (Roman name Mercury) to rescue Io. - Hermes put Argus to sleep with a story and music and then killed him, freeing Io but causing Hera to honor Argus\'s memory by transferring his eyes to the tail feathers of the peacock, her sacred bird. - Io, still in cow form and tormented by a gadfly sent by Hera, wandered across many lands, including crossing the strait that would be named the Bosphorus (meaning \\"Cow\'s Ford\\"). - She encountered Prometheus and received a hopeful prophecy from him. - Eventually, Zeus convinced Hera to restore Io to human form, ending her suffering. - In Egypt, Io married King Telegonus and gave birth to a son, Epaphus, who was mistaken for the god Ammon by the Egyptians. - Io herself was identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis. - The lineage of Io was foretold to produce great heroes, including Perseus and Hercules. This myth has various themes, such as love, jealousy, transformation, and the intertwining fates of gods and mortals. It also reflects how Greek myths were often adapted and absorbed into the local cultures of regions where the Greeks traveled and settled, such as Egypt. The story of Io contributes to the rich tapestry of Classical mythology that has influenced countless aspects of Western culture and literature."},{"prompt":"Based on the story provided, write three Latin sentences: two of them true and one of them false.

The third sentence is false; Jupiter did in fact see Io after she had been transformed into a cow, and it was not by the Nile River that this myth primarily takes place."},{"prompt":"this.worker = new Worker(\'./worker.js\'); This is for nodejs fix it","completion":"In Node.js, you don\'t use the same `Worker` syntax as you would in a web browser. Instead, you need to use the `worker_threads` module, which is a built-in module in Node.js that provides the ability to create threads that execute JavaScript in parallel. To create a new worker in Node.js using the `worker_threads` module, you should rewrite the line as follows: ```javascript const { Worker } = require(\'worker_threads\'); this.worker = new Worker(\'./worker.js\'); ``` Make sure the `worker.js` file is in the correct relative path from the script where you are launching the worker. If `worker.js` is not in the same directory, you need to modify the path accordingly. Also, don\'t forget that to use worker threads, you need to ensure you\'re working with a version of Node.js that supports this feature (v10.5.0 or higher, with the `--experimental-worker` flag before v12), and the feature must be stable in your Node.js version."},{"prompt":"im using esm","completion":"When using ES modules (ESM) in Node.js, you would typically use the `import` statement instead of `require`. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, the `worker_threads` module does not directly support ESM import syntax for creating new worker threads. To work with worker threads in an ESM context, you should still use the `Worker` constructor according to CommonJS conventions, which can be done in an ES module by using the `createRequire` function from the `module` built-in module. This is how you can wrap CommonJS-style `require` in an ES module to import `Worker`. However, make sure you\'re using Node.js version that supports ESM without the need of a flag (v13.2.0 or higher). Here is an example of how you can use `createRequire` to import `Worker` in an ES module: ```javascript import { createRequire } from \'module\'; // Create a Node.js require function that works in the ES module context const require = createRequire(import.meta.url); // Now we can use this require to import the Worker constructor const { Worker } = require(\'worker_threads\'); // Create a worker from worker.js this.worker = new Worker(new URL(\'./worker.js\', import.meta.url)); ``` By using `createRequire` and `import.meta.url`, you can bridge the gap between the CommonJS module system and ES modules, which allows you to use CommonJS imports in an ES module. Also note that the `URL` constructor is used to resolve the path relative to the current ES module file (`import.meta.url`). This is recommended to ensure proper path resolution in ESM. If `worker_threads` are upgraded in the future to support the native ES `import` syntax, you could directly import `Worker` like this: ```javascript import { Worker } from \'worker_threads\'; // This would only work if the native ES module support is added. // Create a worker from worker.js this.worker = new Worker(\'./worker.js\', { type: \'module\' }); ``` But until then, you\'ll have to use a workaround like `createRequire`. Always ensure you check the latest Node.js documentation for any updates on ESM support."},{"prompt":"onmessage is not defined in my nodejs worker for some reason and it exists","completion":"In Node.js\'s `worker_threads` module, you don\'t directly use `onmessage` and `postMessage` as you would within web workers in a browser environment. The interface is slightly different. Instead of `onmessage`, you should listen for the `message` event on the `parentPort` object from `worker_threads`. Similarly, you use `parentPort.postMessage` to send messages back to the main thread. Here is how you handle messages within a worker in Node.js using the `worker_threads` module: In your main thread (`main.js` or equivalent): ```javascript import { Worker } from \'worker_threads\'; // Instantiate a new Worker const worker = new Worker(new URL(\'./worker.js\', import.meta.url)); // Listen for messages from the worker worker.on(\'message\', (message) => { console.log(\'Message from worker:\', message); }); // Send a message to the worker worker.postMessage(\'Hello, worker!\'); ``` In your worker thread (`worker.js` or equivalent): ```javascript import { parentPort } from \'worker_threads\'; // Listen for messages from the parent thread parentPort.on(\'message\', (message) => { console.log(\'Message from parent:\', message); // Send a message back to the main thread parentPort.postMessage(\'Hi, main thread!\'); }); ``` Make sure you\'re using `parentPort.on(\'message\', callback)` to listen for messages and `parentPort.postMessage(data)` to send messages back to the parent (main) thread. If you attempt to use `onmessage` and `postMessage` like you do in the browser, you will encounter errors because those functions are not defined in the Node.js worker environment. The `worker_threads` module is designed to be compatible with the browser\'s Web Workers API, but it is not identical. Also, bear in mind that if you try to use `onmessage` and `postMessage` in the global context of a Node.js worker, they won\'t exist since they are part of the Web Workers API and not the `worker_threads` API. The `parentPort` interface must be used for inter-thread communication."},{"prompt":"data: new Uint8Array(msg.data), How do I send this through ws without losing data. I\'m sending it through JSOn","completion":"In WebSocket communication, you can send data either as text (in a JSON string, for example) or as binary data. If you want to send binary data, like a `Uint8Array`, you should send it directly over the WebSocket connection without converting it to JSON, as JSON is a text-based format. Here\'s how you can send and receive binary data using WebSocket in JavaScript: **Sending binary data:** When using a WebSocket connection (`ws`), you can send the `Uint8Array` directly: ```javascript let ws = new WebSocket(\'ws://example.com/socketserver\'); ws.binaryType = \'arraybuffer\'; // Ensure the binary data is treated in the correct format ws.onopen = function(event) { // Create a Uint8Array or use an existing one const uint8Array = new Uint8Array([/* your data here */]); // Send the data as binary ws.send(uint8Array.buffer); }; ``` **Receiving binary data:** On the receiving end, you can receive binary data and construct a `Uint8Array` from it like this: ```javascript ws.onmessage = function(event) { if (event.data instanceof ArrayBuffer) { // The data is binary const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(event.data); // Use the data as you wish console.log(uint8Array); } else { // The data is text (e.g., JSON) const textData = event.data; // Process the text data if needed console.log(textData); } }; ``` If you must send binary data along with additional information in a text-based format like JSON, you would typically encode the binary data as a string using Base64 encoding. Here\'s an example of how you might do that: **Encoding binary data as Base64:** First, you\'d encode the `Uint8Array` as a Base64 string: ```javascript function bufferToBase64(buffer) { let binary = \'\'; const bytes = new Uint8Array(buffer); const len = bytes.byteLength; for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) { binary += String.fromCharCode(bytes[i]); } return window.btoa(binary); } const uint8Array = new Uint8Array([/* your data here */]); const base64String = bufferToBase64(uint8Array.buffer); // Now you can send it as part of a JSON object const jsonMessage = JSON.stringify({ data: base64String }); // Then send the JSON text message ws.send(jsonMessage); ``` **Decoding Base64 string to a Uint8Array:** On the receiving end, you would then parse the JSON and decode the Base64 string back into a `Uint8Array`: ```javascript ws.onmessage = function(event) { // Assume the message is JSON with a Base64 encoded string const message = JSON.parse(event.data); if (message.data) { // Convert the Base64 string back to a binary buffer const binaryString = window.atob(message.data); const len = binaryString.length; const bytes = new Uint8Array(len); for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) { bytes[i] = binaryString.charCodeAt(i); } // Now you have the original Uint8Array console.log(bytes); } }; ``` Keep in mind that Base64 encoding will increase the size of the data by about 33%, so it\'s better to use binary data directly if possible to reduce overhead. Only use Base64 encoding if you need to include the binary data within a text-based message format."},{"prompt":"write a comedic Stranger Things story about Steve Harrington and Jonathan Byers Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

They strolled through the forest, bantering back and forth. Steve flashed his signature grin. \\"Dude, we\'ve been fighting monsters all week. I say we\'re officially off-duty. Time to relax, Johnny-boy.\\" Jonathan rolled his eyes, a soft smile on his face. \\"Only you would think a river break equates to an off-duty day, Steve.\\" The duo found a serene spot along the riverbank, a perfect hideaway from the hustle and bustle of saving the world from the Upside Down. Without a moment\'s hesitation, Steve and Jonathan tossed away their clothes in an act of carefree rebellion, revealing the stark contrast between their physiques. The sunlit clearing accentuated Steve\'s effortlessly chiseled torso—a testament to his former jock status—while Jonathan showcased a leaner, more wiry frame, the result of nights spent chasing whispers and shadows with his trusty camera. Laughs accompanying their disrobing, they let the crisp water envelope their skin. \\"Man, this is the life,\\" Steve sighed in contentment, half-floating on his back, his wet hair plastered to his forehead. Jonathan nodded in agreement, his slender arms slicing through the cool current. Suddenly, a rogue bubble surfaced next to Steve, followed by a comical gurgle. His face shifted from peace to mischief. Without missing a beat, Jonathan smirked. \\"Didn\'t take you for a trumpet player, Harrington.\\" Steve\'s expression morphed into one of boyish glee as he emitted a triumphant \\"Told you I was talented.\\" His strong frame remained poised, even in the act of disruption. Unable to resist, Jonathan followed suit with a quieter encore, an impish twinkle in his dark eyes. The two chuckled, the surrounding wilderness undisturbed, save for a few unfortunate fish that succumbed to the aromatic assault and floated to the surface. \\"That\'s one way to catch dinner,\\" Steve chuckled. Jonathan burst into laughter. \\"Mom always did say to use what you\'ve got.\\" They plucked the fish from the river and made their way back to the shore, the evening sun painting the sky in shades of gold and purple. As they worked together to build a campfire, Steve poked at the flames, his muscles illuminated by the firelight. \\"At this point, I\'m more scared of your secret weapon than any Demogorgon.\\" Jonathan, arranging the fish over the fire, shot back with a grin, \\"Well, let\'s hope the Shadow Monster doesn\'t have a nose.\\" As the fish cooked, the air filled with a decidedly better aroma, and the comforting crackle of flames underscored their conversation. \\"You know, Byers, despite the olfactory assault, this turned out to be a pretty great day,\\" Steve admitted, laying back and resting his arms behind his head. Jonathan nodded, his focus on turning the fish. \\"Yeah, it did. We should do this more often; ditch the craziness for a bit of normalcy.\\" With sated stomachs and spirits lighter than they\'d been since the Upside Down first bled into their lives, Steve and Jonathan sat back against the riverside earth, a well-earned peace settling over them.

However, a new challenge arises when a software update threatens to bring a new dimension to the phone – the world of augmented reality (AR). Characters: - Gene: Our multi-expressional emoji hero - Jailbreak: The hacker emoji who can code her way out of any situation - Hi-5: Gene\'s enthusiastic friend who loves giving high-fives - Smiler: The once-villainous emoji trying to redeem herself after the events of the first film - New Antagonist: An advanced AR emoji, looking to replace the original emojis and take over Act 1: The Update Life in Textopolis has returned to a semblance of normalcy, with Gene and his friends enjoying daily life. Suddenly, a notification appears – a new phone update is available, and with it, the introduction of augmented reality. Most emojis are excited about the new possibilities, except Gene, who suspects something is amiss. Act 2: The New Dimension When the update is installed, it brings a sleek and shiny AR emoji named Vega into their world. Vega claims that AR is the next evolutionary step for communication, and soon, traditional emojis will be obsolete. As Vega gains popularity, Textopolis emojis start disappearing. It\'s up to Gene and his friends to find out why. Act 3: Into the AR World Gene, Jailbreak, and Hi-5 journey into the AR world to uncover the truth. They meet various AR characters and face challenges that test their friendship and resolve. They find out that Vega has been programmed with a glitch, causing her to erroneously delete emojis instead of integrating them into the AR environment. Act 4: The Showdown Gene and his friends must face off against Vega and her AR minions. Jailbreak devises a plan to rewrite Vega\'s code while Gene and Hi-5 fight to distract her. In a thrilling coding sequence, Jailbreak successfully removes the glitch just in time, saving Vega from her destructive path. Act 5: Unity in Diversity The newfound balance allows emojis and AR characters to coexist. Vega, now fixed, apologizes for the chaos she caused and works with Gene to integrate both worlds smoothly. The phone\'s user delights in the enriched communication experience made possible by the collaboration of emojis and AR. The Ending: In the end, Gene gives a speech about the importance of unity and acceptance. As he speaks, we pan through Textopolis and the AR world, seeing characters from both dimensions interacting harmoniously. The once-divided worlds are now united, and the emojis look forward to a future of endless possibilities in the digital age.

This script would be written in JavaScript and would require a basic understanding of how to interact with both applications through scripting. Below is an example of how you could create a script that allows a user to choose an Adobe Illustrator action from a list and run it on selected files in Adobe Bridge. ```javascript #target bridge if( BridgeTalk.appName == \\"bridge\\" ) { var menu = MenuElement.create( \\"command\\", \\"Run Illustrator Action on Selection\\", \\"at the end of Tools\\" ); menu.onSelect = function () { var selectedThumbnails = app.document.selections; // Check if there are selected files if (selectedThumbnails.length > 0) { // Prompt user to enter the name of the Illustrator action and the action set var actionName = prompt(\\"Enter the name of the Illustrator Action:\\", \\"\\"); var actionSet = prompt(\\"Enter the name of the Illustrator Action Set:\\", \\"\\"); if (actionName && actionSet) { for (var i = 0; i < selectedThumbnails.length; i++) { var file = new File(selectedThumbnails[i].spec); if (file.exists && /ai/i.test(file.name)) { // Let\'s send a message to Illustrator to run the action var bt = new BridgeTalk(); bt.target = \\"illustrator\\"; bt.body = \\"var file = File(\'\\" + file.fsName + \\"\');\\" + \\"app.open(file);\\" + \\"app.doScript(\'\\"+actionName+\\"\', \'\\"+actionSet+\\"\');\\" + \\"app.activeDocument.close(SaveOptions.SAVECHANGES);\\"; bt.send(); } } } } else { alert(\\"No files selected!\\"); } }; } ``` Here\'s a step by step of what it does: 1. The script adds a new menu item to the Tools menu in Adobe Bridge called \\"Run Illustrator Action on Selection\\". 2. When the menu item is selected, the script prompts the user to input the name of the action and the action set that they wish to run. 3. It then loops through all of the selected thumbnails (files) in Bridge and checks if they\'re Adobe Illustrator files by their extension. 4. For each Illustrator file, it sends a message to Illustrator telling it to open the file, run the specified action from the specified set, and then save and close the document. Please note, when interacting with Adobe applications through scripting, you should make sure that you have the necessary permissions to access the applications and control them via scripts. The user running the script should have Illustrator installed and actions should be saved in Illustrator. The files that are being processed must be compatible with Adobe Illustrator. Keep in mind this script assumes that the actions you provide are correctly named and exist within the provided action set in Illustrator, and does not include error handling for these scenarios. It also runs the action on all selected documents, and immediately saves and closes them. You might want to adjust this behavior based on your actual workflow."},{"prompt":"That one worked well, but I guess due to loading times Illustrator freezes, we can may be add wait Illustrator to handle or another option. Also is it possible to add drop-down box to interface which shows current actions in Illustrator?","completion":"Adding a wait or delay within the script execution can be a bit challenging because the scripting environment tends to execute linearly without waiting for user interaction or program response. We can\'t really delay the execution of the BridgeTalk messages because they are sent asynchronously. However, we can add some checks in Illustrator to ensure the document is ready before proceeding. Additionally, creating a drop-down list of actions in Illustrator via Bridge script is not straightforward, as Bridge itself doesn\'t have access to the actions list in Illustrator directly. One way to mitigate the freezing issue is to add a simple delay within the Illustrator script part, giving it time to load each document. Here’s an updated version of the BridgeTalk part of the script: ```javascript bt.body = \\"var file = File(\'\\" + file.fsName.replace(//g, \\"\\") + \\"\');\\" + \\"app.open(file);\\" // Delay function to give Illustrator some time to load the document + \\"function delay(sec) {\\" + \\" var start = new Date();\\" + \\" var now = null;\\" + \\" do { now = new Date(); }\\" + \\" while(now - start < sec * 1000);\\" + \\"}\\" + \\"delay(5);\\" + \\"if (app.documents.length > 0 && app.activeDocument.fullName == file) {\\" + \\" app.doScript(\'\\" + actionName + \\"\', \'\\" + actionSet + \\"\');\\" + \\" app.activeDocument.close(SaveOptions.SAVECHANGES);\\" + \\"}\\"; bt.send(); ``` Regarding the drop-down box containing the Illustrator actions, a possible solution could be to create a startup script in Illustrator that sends the list of actions back to Bridge, which then creates a dialog with those options. However, this is quite complex and could potentially become unreliable if Illustrator has not been started or the startup script fails. Here is a very rough idea of what you\'d need to do for the drop-down box, but please be aware that this is advanced and may not be fully implemented or functional: 1. Illustrator startup script that sends back the list of actions to Bridge. 2. Bridge listens for this response and builds the drop-down list dialog. 3. The User selects the action, and Bridge sends the command to Illustrator as before. Creating such a two-way communication process is beyond the scope of a simple text response. It would require a much more in-depth understanding of both the Bridge and Illustrator scripting environments, their events, and an intelligent way to establish communication between the two. Furthermore, the Bridge scripting environment has limited UI capabilities, and creating a dynamic drop-down list based on another application\'s state is not straightforward. A more practical solution would be to maintain a list of known actions and action sets within the script itself and allow users to select from those options. This would require manual updating of the script if new actions are added or old ones are removed. Given the complexities and potential for issues with trying to dynamically retrieve the action list from Illustrator, many users would opt for the manual approach or consider using ExtendScript Toolkit to write more complex scripts that interact with both applications in a more tightly coupled manner."},{"prompt":"Let\'s create another illustrator script.

Please remember to adjust the script to match your flag file formats and names to correspond with the country names used in the artboards. This script assumes that the flags are named with the same names that you enter when prompted for country names, and it uses PNG format, so make sure to change the `getFiles` filter if your flags have a different extension. Note that this script does not include detailed error checking or handling and assumes that the flag files have been named correctly to match the entered country names.

And then we should place illustrator files inside artboards and put under 200x200 rectangles centered in the artboard.","completion":"Certainly! The script outlined below first prompts the user to select a folder containing Illustrator files. It then counts the files and creates an artboard for each one. Each artboard is named according to the file name. A 200x200 rectangle is placed in the center of each artboard, and the Illustrator file is then placed into the artboard to be aligned with the rectangle. Here\'s how you could write a script to perform these tasks: ```javascript #target illustrator // Helper function to add artboards and centered rectangles function createArtboardsAndRectangles(filenames) { var artboardSize = 200; var margin = 20; var cols = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(filenames.length)); var rows = Math.ceil(filenames.length / cols); // Create document with initial artboard var doc = app.documents.add( DocumentColorSpace.RGB, cols * (artboardSize + margin), rows * (artboardSize + margin) ); // Make use of the first artboard as the first item var initialAbRect = doc.artboards[0].artboardRect; var rectangles = []; for (var i = 0; i < filenames.length; i++) { var row = Math.floor(i / cols); var col = i % cols; var left = col * (artboardSize + margin); var top = doc.height - (row * (artboardSize + margin)); // Only add a new artboard if it is not the first one if(i > 0) { var artboardRect = [left, top, left + artboardSize, top - artboardSize]; doc.artboards.add(artboardRect); } else { // Adjust the first artboard size doc.artboards[0].artboardRect = [initialAbRect[0], initialAbRect[1], initialAbRect[0] + artboardSize, initialAbRect[1] - artboardSize]; } doc.artboards[i].name = filenames[i].substring(0, filenames[i].lastIndexOf(\'.\')); // Each rectangle is exactly the artboardSize and centered within the artboard var rect = doc.pathItems.rectangle(top - margin / 2, left + margin / 2, artboardSize, artboardSize); rect.stroked = false; // No stroke rect.filled = true; // Set to false if no fill is desired rect.fillColor = new NoColor(); // No color rectangles.push(rect); } return {document: doc, rectangles: rectangles}; } // Function to place Illustrator files into the artboards function placeIllustratorFiles(folderPath, doc, rectangles) { var filesFolder = new Folder(folderPath); var illustratorFiles = filesFolder.getFiles(function(f) { return f instanceof File && /.ai/i.test(f.name); }); for (var i = 0; i < illustratorFiles.length && i < doc.artboards.length; i++) { var placedItem = doc.placedItems.add(); placedItem.file = illustratorFiles[i]; // Center the placed item within the artboard var ab = doc.artboards[i].artboardRect; placedItem.width = 200; placedItem.height = 200; var x = ab[0] + (ab[2] - ab[0] - placedItem.width) / 2; var y = ab[1] - (ab[1] - ab[3] - placedItem.height) / 2; placedItem.position = [x, y]; var rect = rectangles[i]; placedItem.zOrder(ZOrderMethod.BRINGTOFRONT); // Place the item in front of the rectangle rect.zOrder(ZOrderMethod.SENDTOBACK); // Move the rectangle to back } if (illustratorFiles.length > doc.artboards.length) { alert(\'There are more Illustrator files than artboards.\'); } } // Ask user to select the folder where the Illustrator files are located var selectedFolder = Folder.selectDialog(\'Please select the folder containing the Illustrator files:\'); if (selectedFolder) { var illustratorFiles = selectedFolder.getFiles(function(f) { return f instanceof File && /.ai/i.test(f.name); }); if (illustratorFiles.length > 0) { var filenames = illustratorFiles.map(function(file) { return file.name; }); var result = createArtboardsAndRectangles(filenames); var doc = result.document; var rectangles = result.rectangles; placeIllustratorFiles(selectedFolder.fsName, doc, rectangles); } else { alert(\'No Illustrator files found in the selected folder.\'); } } else { alert(\'No folder has been selected or the selection was canceled.\'); } ``` Save the above code into a `.jsx` file and run it from Illustrator using the File > Scripts menu. When running: 1. The script prompts the user to select the folder where the Illustrator files are located. 2. It lists all the `.ai` files in that folder. 3. It creates a new document with an artboard and a centered rectangle for each file. 4. It places each Illustrator file into its corresponding artboard and rectangle. Important notes: - The Illustrator files will be resized to fit the 200x200 rectangles. If you desire a different behavior (such as scaling by a certain percentage), you will need to adjust the transformation code that sets the `width` and `height` of the `placedItem`. - The script assumes that all Illustrator files to be placed are in the selected folder and that the folder contains only Illustrator files meant to be placed. - The script generates the artboards dynamically, based on the number of Illustrator files found."},{"prompt":"Write a detailed story with in character dialogue about Lucio being put into an ambulance and driven away. As the ambulance is along the road, Lucio gets up, thanking the paramedics for the ride. The paramedics smile, before they peel off their faces and uniforms, revealing Tracer and Mercy underneath. Detail the paramedic faces.","completion":"As the sirens wailed and the light atop the ambulance flashed through the bustling cityscape, Lucio sat inside amidst a flutter of activity. His pulse raced, not from injury but from adrenaline and the thrill of the stealth mission he and his Overwatch teammates had embarked upon. \\"I appreciate the lift, folks,\\" Lucio grinned to the \'paramedics\' attending to him. Both were dressed impeccably in navy blue uniforms adorned with the standard medical insignia; their calm demeanors contrasted the chaos of the streets they navigated through with practiced ease. \\"Don\'t mention it, Lucio,\\" replied the paramedic at his side, her voice soothing yet tinged with an accent that felt oddly familiar. \\"It\'s all part of the service.\\" Lucio lay back against the gurney, pretending to be incapacitated as he had been instructed. The plan was simple—pose as an injured civilian to infiltrate the enemy’s territory. Overwatch intelligence indicated that the target sector was heavily guarded, with checkpoints that even Lucio\'s superstar status wouldn\'t bypass unnoticed. But an ambulance... well, that was another story. As they drove, Lucio peered through the window, noting every street and turn, subtly committing the path to memory for his team\'s exfiltration. The \'paramedic\' who had driven the ambulance finished her checks on the vehicle’s dashboard before turning her attention briefly to Lucio. Her brown eyes met his, and her lips twitched into a barely-there smile. \\"Just relax and enjoy the ride. We\'ll be there in no time.\\" The false patient returned the smile, giving them both a thumbs up. \\"You got it! I’ve got the best seat in the house!\\" he exclaimed, tapping his foot to a silent beat. A few moments passed in this curious calm before Lucio sat up abruptly. \\"I think that\'s my cue,\\" he announced cheerfully. \\"We\'re close to the drop-off, right?\\" With acquiescent nods, the two \'paramedics\' stepped back, allowing Lucio to swing his legs off the gurney. Before he could say another word, they began to unravel their clever disguises. The one who had been driving peeled away the latex mask from her face, revealing flawless skin and a head of short, spiky blond hair beneath. Mercy, known for her unparalleled medical skills, winked at Lucio as she revealed her true identity. The precision of the mask was astounding—every contour, every line replicated to perfection; even the color of the artificial skin mimicked her own with an uncanny accuracy. Next to her, Tracer – the effervescent British agent with the power to bend time – was also shedding her disguise. She removed her dark-framed glasses and pulled at the edge of her face, revealing the bright, lively features beneath. She let out an exhilarating laugh as her chronal accelerator blinked blue through the gap in her opened jumpsuit. \\"Oh, you should have seen your face, Lucio!\\" Tracer teased, her typical Cockney cheer never far from the surface. \\"Priceless!\\" Lucio looked back and forth between the two women, chuckling. \\"And here I thought I was in good hands! Turns out I\'m just in familiar ones.\\" Mercy folded her arms now free from the paramedic jacket that had concealed her valkyrie suit, her caduceus staff tucked safely away in a compartment within the ambulance. \\"All part of Overwatch\'s service,\\" she reiterated, her eyes gleaming with a mix of mirth and professionalism. Tracer gave a playful salute as the ambulance slowed down. \\"Alright then, time to get serious. Are you ready to drop the beat, Lucio?\\" The Brazilian DJ nodded, donning his green-tinted visor and activating his Sonic Amplifier. \\"Let\'s break it down!\\" The trio shared a determined nod, the consequence of their mission lingering unspoken between them. They knew when the doors to the ambulance opened, they would be stepping into a dangerous fray. With a practiced hand, Tracer guided the vehicle into an unassuming service alley, and as the back doors swung open to swalIow the last haze of their duplicity, the Overwatch agents stepped out into the shadowed silence, ready for whatever lay ahead."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but Tracer and Mercy are disguised as Sombra and Moira.","completion":"In the din of sirens and the light slicing through the urban dusk, Lucio sat staged amidst an orchestration of deception. His heart quickened not from injury but from the adrenaline of the covert operation with his Overwatch operatives. \\"Thanks for the hitch,\\" Lucio murmured with a wink at the \'paramedics\' who flanked him, dressed in standard emergency medical gear—pristine white with vibrant touches of ambulance red forming the universal plus sign. They responded to his banter with a professional nod, careful to maintain their characters. The ambience inside the ambulance was a performance of calm urgency, as per the script of their ploy to slip behind enemy lines. Lucio was their ticket—a guise of an injured citizen to aid their surreptitious entry into a high-security zone impenetrable to even the radiant celebrity of Lucio himself. Ambulances, however, came and went more freely. Through the window, as the ambulance swerved and cornered, Lucio’s sharp eyes cataloged the journey for his teammates\' eventual extraction. His mind wove the urban fabric into a roadmap he tucked safely away in his memory. The \'paramedic\' steering the vehicle cast a glance back at Lucio, her darkened lenses obscuring eyes that were perhaps too keen, her expression guarded. \\"You just sit back, we\'ll have you where you need to be before you know it,\\" she said, a harder edge to her voice than Mercy\'s softer tones. When Lucio judged they were nearing their destination, he lifted from his feigned repose with a smile, \\"Guess it\'s showtime, huh?\\" As the paramedics stepped aside with professional detachment, they made a show of discarding their roles. \\"Much better,\\" the one who had been driving remarked as she began to peel the intricately modeled latex from her face, revealing the olive-toned skin and white-streaked hair of Sombra—but it was only a second mask, beneath which the real face of Mercy was revealed. The Sombra disguise had been faithful down to the cybernetic purple glyphs and iconic smirk, a testament to Overwatch\'s meticulous attention to detail. Beside her, the second paramedic—posed as a stern-looking Moira with a head of flaming red hair and piercing yellow eyes—likewise shed her fabricated appearance. Her mask came away to reveal Tracer\'s jaunty grin and warm brown eyes. \\"You sure know how to play a part, Lucio,\\" she chuckled, her accent a stark contrast to Moira\'s more formal cadence. Lucio clapped in appreciation as he stood, dusting off his legs. \\"I should say the same to you two! Had me completely fooled.\\" The glow of the medical uniform faded away as Mercy abandoned the stiff, collared shirt and Tracer stepped out of the bulky paramedic pants, revealing the distinctive Overwatch gear beneath. Mercy\'s caduceus staff and Tracer\'s chronal accelerator had been cleverly hidden, ready for the coming action. With the flicker of his visor, Lucio cued, \\"Ready to play some tunes!\\" The camaraderie was brief as the ambulance eased to a halt in an out-of-sight alley, the gravity of their mission pressing down upon them. They were about to dive headlong into hostile territory, but for now, they stood united, hidden behind the wrinkled curtains of an unremarkable service road. Tracer cocked her head, “We’ve got one shot at this. Everyone in position?\\" Mercy and Lucio nodded, the façade of an ordinary ambulance fading with the echo of their resolve. The back doors of the vehicle opened, casting night air onto their faces like a challenge. And with that, the Overwatch agents stepped out, vanishing into the night’s embrace, ready to do battle with whatever awaited."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but forget the paramedic and ambulance thing.","completion":"Lucio strode confidently alongside Tracer and Mercy, their footsteps echoing through the cavernous underground tunnel they’d chosen for their infiltration route. The dim lighting cast long shadows, wrapping the trio in a cloak of obscurity as they advanced on their mission. \\"Appreciate you two backing me up on this,\\" Lucio said, his voice a murmur in the gloom. His usual vibrant, crowd-pleasing attire was replaced by tactical gear, less flashy but better suited for stealth. Tracer, bristling with energy, responded with an emphatic nod. \\"Wouldn’t miss it for the world, Lucio! Plus, I\'ve been aching to test out my new gadgetry.\\" Beside her, Mercy carried an aura of serene confidence, her caduceus staff slung across her back. \\"We must ensure the success of this operation,\\" she added. \\"It\'s vital to Overwatch\'s efforts.\\" The mission was delicate. Intelligence indicated a shadowy faction amassed perilous technology and weapon caches that needed neutralization. Overwatch had been clear: disruption was essential, and Lucio, with Tracer and Mercy, formed the vanguard. As the sound of their purposeful strides melded with the quiet drip of condensation, the operatives approached a fortified entry point. Lucio glanced at his companions, a green glow reflecting off his visor as he prepped his Sonic Amplifier. \\"You ready, Lucio?\\" Mercy asked, her eyes scanning the area for any sign of hostiles. \\"Once we breach the compound, there\'s no turning back.\\" Lucio offered a confident smirk, \\"Born ready.\\" Meanwhile, Tracer had already flitted to the control panel beside the sealed door. \\"On it,\\" she confirmed, fingers dancing over the interface. A faint blue tether extended from her chronal accelerator, interfacing with the technology. \\"Give me two shakes...\\" There was a tense pause, punctuated by the subtle clicks of her tampering. With a triumphant \\"Got it!\\" from Tracer, the door emitted a thunderous clank and slowly began to rise. The three agents exchanged a silent nod, their individual resolve crystallizing into collective determination. They slipped through the gap, one by one, engulfed by the murky confines of the enemy’s lair. Lucio’s Amp bathed the passage ahead in an oscillating emerald hue. \\"Time to make some noise,\\" he announced, volume restrained but intent playlist. Mercy grasped her staff, its golden light ready to defend and heal, as Tracer’s accelerator pulsed steadily, priming her for quick bursts of action. The night seemed to hold its breath as the Overwatch operatives pushed forward; each step closer to the heart of the facility was a step closer to a dangerous confrontation with the enigmatic foe. Stealth was their ally until it wasn\'t, and as they encountered resistance—a sentry here, a security drone there—each member of the team proved invaluable. Lucio\'s sound barriers deflected incoming fire, Tracer blinked through the chaos, dismantling their adversary\'s coordination, and Mercy\'s healing rays brought calm to the storm of combat. United, they pushed toward the dark heart of the enemy\'s operation, where success or failure awaited them."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but keep Tracer and Mercy being disguised in Sombra and Moira masks, rescuing Lucio in character of the people they are disguised as, when in a safe place, fully detail Tracer and Mercy pulling off the masks.","completion":"Lucio was surrounded, the pulsating glow from his Sonic Amplifier the only light in the gloom of his holding cell. Overwatch had been compromised, and he\'d been captured during the fire-fight. As he contemplated his next move, the door to his cell creaked open, casting a sliver of light across the darkened floor. In strode two figures, one radiating an ominous presence and the other cloaked in shadows. The first, with Sombra\'s signature purple hues and cybernetic enhancements, approached with a cocksure grin. \\"Looks like you could use some help,\\" she said, her voice electronically distorted to mimic Sombra\'s. The second figure, standing tall and enigmatic, bore the unmistakable silhouette of Moira. Her stoic demeanor and hollow gaze conveyed a message clear as day—they were not Overwatch. Yet, despite their façade, Lucio sensed familiarities in their stance and stride. \\"Tracer? Mercy?\\" he ventured a guess, hope flaring through his words. The \'Sombra\' tapped the side of her head, her smirk wide, but filled with Tracer\'s ever-present playfulness. \\"Keep it down, yeah? We\'ve got to get out of dodge before they realize their prized DJ\'s gone missing,\\" she warned, her accent a strange blend of Sombra\'s and her own London lilt. \'Moira\' nodded and without a word, extended her hand with an elegance that seemed out of character, beckoning Lucio to follow. It was Mercy\'s grace, even beneath the disguise. They navigated the shadowy corridors with Lucio in tow, the alarm still quiet. Every step taken was meticulous, each corner checked—a ballet of disciplined evasion. Once they\'d reached the refuge of an abandoned warehouse, a safe distance from the enemy\'s stronghold, the pair finally allowed themselves to relieve the guise that had seen them through the mission thus far. \'Moira\' reached up, her fingers finding purchase under the chin of the elaborate mask. As she peels it away, the cold, calculating facade of the geneticist was discarded, revealing the warm, caring visage of Angela Ziegler—Mercy. Her skin, momentarily imprinted with the faint lines of the mask\'s interior, flushed back to its usual glow. Her blonde hair, neatly tucked beneath the mask, fell in gentle waves around her shoulders, and her blue eyes sparkled with relief. Beside her, \'Sombra\' was similarly transforming. With an established flourish, Tracer pulled off the cloaking mask to reveal her impish grin and lively eyes. The poignant purple of Sombra\'s hair was replaced by Tracer\'s spiky brown locks, and the familiar glow of her chronal accelerator flickered reassuringly at her core. \\"Blimey, that\'s better!\\" Tracer exclaimed, enthusiastically shaking out her head as if to rid herself of the last vestiges of her temporary identity. Lucio breathed a sigh of release, chuckling at the success of their audacious rescue. \\"Never thought I\'d be happy to see Moira and Sombra taking their faces off,\\" he joked, \\"You two really had me for a second.\\" Mercy smiled, her gear shifting back to its natural state with an assured click, her winged Valkyrie suit underneath emerging pristine and battle-ready. \\"Now, let\'s get you properly to safety, Lucio,\\" Mercy said, her voice no longer constrained by the synthesized mimicry of Moira. \\"And let\'s make it quick,\\" Tracer added, her eyes now free of constraint, \\"before those baddies figure out they\'ve lost their prize DJ!\\" With their facades abandoned, true identities embraced, and their companion secured, the trio set off into the embrace of the night—a harborer of both danger and freedom—with the unity of Overwatch guiding them onward."},{"prompt":"use dsw_ec1 CREATE TABLE categorias ( id_categoria INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, descripcion VARCHAR(100) ); INSERT INTO categorias (descripcion) VALUES (\'Acción\'), (\'Comedia\'), (\'Drama\'); CREATE TABLE peliculas ( id_pelicula INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, titulo VARCHAR(100), sinopsis TEXT, año_estreno INT, clasificacion VARCHAR(50), id_categoria INT, FOREIGN KEY (id_categoria) REFERENCES categorias (id_categoria) ); INSERT INTO peliculas (titulo, sinopsis, año_estreno, clasificacion, id_categoria) VALUES (\'Los Increíbles\', \'Una familia de superhéroes que pelea contra el mal.\', 2004, \'PG\', 2); (\'Rápidos y Furiosos\', \'Acción y adrenalina en las carreras callejeras.\', 2001, \'PG-13\', 1), (\'El Rey León\', \'Un joven león que lucha contra la adversidad.\', 1994, \'G\', 2), (\'Misión Imposible\', \'Un espía se enfrenta a misiones de alto riesgo.\', 1996, \'PG-13\', 1), (\'El Padrino 1\', \'El ascenso de la familia Corleone .\', 1972, \'R\', 3), - siguiendo esa logica crea 5 insert mas","completion":"Sure, let\'s follow the logic presented and create 5 more INSERT statements into the `peliculas` table using the `categorias` table\'s identifiers for genre categorization: ```sql INSERT INTO peliculas (titulo, sinopsis, año_estreno, clasificacion, id_categoria) VALUES (\'Forrest Gump\', \'La historia de un hombre con un coeficiente intelectual bajo y su extraordinaria vida.\', 1994, \'PG-13\', 2), (\'Batman: El Caballero de la Noche\', \'Batman se enfrenta al Joker en una batalla por el alma de Ciudad Gótica.\', 2008, \'PG-13\', 1), (\'Titanic\', \'Un romance a bordo del fatídico y lujoso transatlántico.\', 1997, \'PG-13\', 3), (\'Toy Story\', \'Juguetes que cobran vida cuando los humanos no están presentes inician una aventura.\', 1995, \'G\', 2), (\'Gladiador\', \'Un general romano busca venganza contra el corrupto emperador que asesinó a su familia.\', 2000, \'R\', 1); ``` Please ensure that the `id_categoria` values used here match the ones you have inserted into the `categorias` table.

Steve Harrington and his unexpected companion, Jonathan Byers, both feeling the weight of interdimensional beasts and teenage drama, decided they needed some much-deserved R&R. After wandering for what seemed like hours, they stumbled upon a serene river that was perfect for their escape from the chaos. \\"Man, I can\'t remember the last time I just chilled out. Mom would kill me if she saw me playing hooky,\\" Steve said, grinning with his perfectly coiffed hair glinting in the sunlight. Jonathan, camera usually slung over his shoulder, seemed a bit out of his element without it. \\"Yeah, well, sometimes you just gotta step back and breathe...or swim,\\" he mused. Not one for formalities, Steve tossed his clothes aside with gusto, revealing his swim-team toned physique, a testament to his athlete days at Hawkins High. Jonathan, a bit more reserved, followed suit, showing off the lean, wiry frame of someone who spent their days in the darkroom and their nights hunting otherworldly creatures. Both now in the buff, Nature\'s Adam\'s, they waded into the cooling embrace of the river. The water was just right, lapping gently around them as they leaned back and let out synchronized sighs of relief. Steve, always one to make a comedic moment out of nothing, let out an unexpected fart, bubbles rising and popping at the surface. \\"Oh man, when did it become taco night in the river, Steve?\\" Jonathan laughed, the corners of his lips turning up into a rare, carefree smile. \\"Hey, when nature calls, you gotta answer,\\" Steve joked back, his face flushing a mix of embarrassment and mirth, his typically heroic facade giving way to the sheer hilarity of the situation. Not to be outdone and feeling equally relaxed, Jonathan decided to join the symphony. His face contorted into a mix of concentration and amusement, as another set of bubbles announced the arrival of his contribution to their aquatic concert. Steve chuckled, \\"Oh, it\'s a duel now? Mind if I... up the ante?\\" He bore down, his face showing the strain of a man about to unleash a monster, muscles temporarily tensing, before yet another bout of bubbles surfaced, only this time several fish nearby went belly-up, overwhelmed by the dubious aromatic assault. \\"Dude, did you just—?\\" \\"Yup. I think we just found dinner,\\" Steve said, not able to hold back the laughter any longer. Jonathan shook his head, laughter catching up with him too, \\"Never thought I\'d fish with my... Never mind.\\" They both grabbed the unfortunate fish, carrying them back to the shore like hunters proud of their unorthodox methods. As the evening settled in, and the fire crackled, they skewered their catch and held it over the flames. Steve gave his a skeptical sniff before shrugging and roasting it, \\"Probably better than the cafeteria\'s mystery meat.\\" \\"Without a doubt,\\" Jonathan agreed, his mind likely comparing it to his mother\'s cooking, he added, \\"The smell\'s practically gourmet.\\" They ate, the taste surprisingly good for fish that met their end in such a peculiar way. A comfortable silence enveloped them as they enjoyed the warmth from the fire and the surreal peace of their situation. \\"Honestly, didn\'t peg you for an outdoor guy, Byers,\\" Steve said, stretching out his lean legs toward the fire.

As the stars began to glitter above them, Steve and Jonathan sat there silently, acknowledging that in Hawkins, even a day meant for relaxation could turn into something totally unexpected... and hilarious."},{"prompt":"Как можно использовать генеративные сети для поиска начала и конца смыслового куска в тексте, например, среди большого текста нужно найти начало и конец диалога с клиентом","completion":"Генеративные сети, такие как Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) или Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), стали широко известными благодаря их способности создавать новые образцы данных, похожие на распределение исходных данных. Однако для задачи определения начала и конца смыслового куска в тексте, такого как диалог, использование генеративных сетей может быть не самым оптимальным подходом. Тем не менее, некоторые обученные на большом наборе данных модели глубокого обучения, особенно модели на основе трансформеров, такие как GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) от OpenAI или BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) от Google, способны генерировать текст и обрабатывать естественный язык на уровне понимания смысла и контекста. Эти модели можно обучить (или использовать предварительно обученные версии) для того, чтобы определять начало и конец определенных разделов текста, таких как диалоги. Вот несколько шагов, как можно подойти к обнаружению начала и конца диалога в тексте: 1. **Подготовка данных**: Выделите примеры текстов с диалогами и пометьте начало и конец каждого диалога в этих текстах. 2. **Fine-tuning модели**: Используйте предварительно обученную модель на основе трансформеров и дообучите (fine-tune) ее на подготовленном наборе данных. При дообучении модель должна учиться выделять границы диалога. 3. **Обучение классификатора**: Вместо генерационных моделей использовать обучение с учителем, чтобы классифицировать каждое предложение или параграф текста как начало диалога, конец диалога или не связанный с диалогом текст. 4. **Sequence labeling**: Вы можете формализовать задачу как задачу sequence labeling, где для каждого токена (или предложения) требуется предсказать, является ли он началом, внутренней частью, концом диалога или вообще не относится к диалогу. 5. **Использование моделей Sequence-to-Sequence**: Такие модели могут быть обучены для генерации нового текста с пометками начала и конца диалога на основе исходного текста без таких пометок. Стоит отметить, что для предсказания структурных элементов текста также часто используются специальные sequence tagging модели, такие как Conditional Random Fields (CRF) или BiLSTM-CRF, которые могут быть эффективными в обнаружении границ фраз или абзацев, включая диалоги. Обучение модели на конкретную задачу требует наличия достаточного набора данных с размеченными примерами, позволяющих модели учиться распознавать структурные шаблоны текста, связанные с диалогами."},{"prompt":"Что такое sequence tagging модели","completion":"Sequence tagging - это задача автоматической разметки последовательности токенов (обычно слов или символов) с некоторыми метками. Это тип задачи обработки естественного языка, где каждому элементу входных данных нужно сопоставить соответствующий тег из заранее определенного набора. Целью является получение последовательности тегов, которая наилучшим образом отражает распределение меток на входных данных. Примеры применения sequence tagging включают: - Распознавание именованных сущностей (Named Entity Recognition, NER): каждому слову присваивается метка, указывающая, является ли оно частью имени, местоположения, организации и так далее. - Частеречная разметка (Part-Of-Speech, POS tagging): классификация слов по их частям речи, например, как существительное, глагол, прилагательное и так далее. - Chunking: определение фраз в предложениях, таких как существительные или глагольные группы. Для решения задач sequence tagging часто используют следующие модели: 1. **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**: статистическая модель, которая использует предположения о марковских свойствах последовательности для предсказания тегов. 2. **Conditional Random Fields (CRF)**: дискриминативная вероятностная модель, которая предсказывает теги для всей последовательности, учитывая зависимость между соседними тегами. CRF учитывает контекст при предсказании метки для каждого слова, что делает её более точной по сравнению с независимыми классификаторами. 3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: подходы с RNN особенно хорошо подходят для обработки последовательностей данных, поскольку они способны учитывать контекст на произвольной длине последовательности. 4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: вид RNN, разработанный для решения проблем долгосрочных зависимостей, LSTM-сети способны запоминать информацию на более длинных временных интервалах. 5. **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**: улучшенная версия LSTM, которая обрабатывает последовательность как в прямом, так и в обратном направлении, способствуя лучшему пониманию контекста. 6. **BiLSTM с CRF-слоем**: комбинация BiLSTM и CRF для улучшения работы с последовательностями путём моделирования зависимостей между тегами в дополнение к автоматическому извлечению признаков. Сети Transformer и их вариации, такие как BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), также стали популярными для задач sequence tagging, поскольку они предлагают ещё больший контекст и мощные средства извлечения признаков благодаря механизмам внимания. При обучении моделей для sequence tagging необходимо иметь набор размеченных данных, где каждому токену в тексте соответствует метка. Модель обучается на таком наборе данных для того, чтобы автоматически предсказывать метки для неразмеченных данных."},{"prompt":"Note: This is an idea I had because Pop was once owned by Sony Boofus, a blue squid like alien and Diggle a orange rabbit-like alien, both live on the Moon, have to form a group of other animal-like alien friends to save the universe from a maniacal monster who seeks to destroy it, They name their team the \\"MoonGoons\\", Based on the Pop UK (kids channel) mascots Produced by: Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, GoAnimate Studios.

Meanwhile, in the digital meme-scape, Doge, the adored Shiba Inu meme, accidentally makes a face that breaks the cardinal rule of “always being on point,” putting his existence in jeopardy. As the meme community reels from Doge’s faux pas, an ominous threat looms on the horizon. A new, sophisticated AI algorithm, designed by tech prodigy Evelyn Cipher, is being unleashed onto the internet with the ability to delete memes it deems “non-viral” or “outdated” to improve online content quality. With Doge’s mistake making him a prime target, the memes must band together to avoid deletion. At the same time, Mr. Whimsley’s journey into understanding memes takes on a whole new meaning as he unexpectedly becomes the subject of a viral meme himself due to his bewildering reactions to modern technology. Dubbed “Out of Context Educator,” his newfound internet fame catapults Whimsley into the digital world, where he must navigate this strange new reality. Whimsley and Doge’s paths collide, and together, with a band of colorful meme characters, including Nyan Cat, Grumpy Cat, Bad Luck Brian, and the iconic Trollface, they embark on an adventure to stop Evelyn’s AI before it erases the essence of internet culture. The motley crew must use the power of virality, trendsetting, and the unbreakable bonds formed in the meme community to overcome challenges, from battling the dark corners of the Dark Web to confronting the AI in a climactic showdown inside the mainframe of the internet itself. Throughout the film, humor and heartwarming moments are captured as unlikely friendships develop, especially between Whimsley and the Doge, who teach each other the value of adaptation and timeless relevance. In a race against time, memes of generations past and present come together to save themselves and the future of internet expression. With scenes packed with nods to pop culture and clever Easter eggs for keen-eyed internet aficionados, “The Meme Movie” strikes a balance between the comedic absurdity of meme culture and a narrative about embracing change and the power of collective action. In the end, Doge and Whimsley find a way to update the AI’s algorithm to understand that memes have a life and significance beyond just viral numbers. Instead, they embody the creativity and spirit of human connection. And while Whimsley returns to the real world with a newfound sense of relevance and hipness, Doge’s new face becomes embraced, sparking a heartwarming trend of accepting imperfections as part of what makes a meme, and everyone, special. Tagline: Virality has a new hero. Write a blog post where the first idea was met with acclaim, but the Meme Movie was maligned, being seen as the \\"Emoji Movie all over again\\"","completion":"# From Lunar Laughs to Digital Disasters: A Tale of Two Animations In the realm of animated movies, creativity knows no bounds, and every so often, we witness the conception of ideas that resonate with audiences and critics alike, while others... not so much. Today, we explore two big projects that aimed to tap into the cultural zeitgeist, yet elicited starkly contrasting reactions. \\"MoonGoons\\" - The Unexpected Hit That Charmed the Universe First up, the surprise darling of the animation world, \\"MoonGoons.\\" With its witty title and inspired characters, it soared past expectations and won over the hearts of moviegoers young and old. The story of Boofus and Diggle, along with their eclectic team of animal-like alien friends, was not only a visual feast but also a narrative layered with humor, adventure, and a poignant message of unity that truly made it shine. Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, and GoAnimate Studios brought to life a whimsical tale set against the backdrop of the moon and beyond. They managed to orchestrate a symphony of colorful characters who joined forces to combat a universe-threatening evil. By focusing on the camaraderie between the unlikely heroes and their quest to overcome adversity, \\"MoonGoons\\" turned out to be a masterclass in storytelling that captivated imaginations and received acclaim for its fresh take on the animated ensemble genre. But as history has demonstrated, not every foray into the creation of animation garners such a warm reception. \\"The Meme Movie\\" - A Viral Venture Gone Awry In stark contrast, we have the well-intentioned yet misguided venture known as \\"The Meme Movie.\\" It seemed like a slam dunk on paper – harness the omnipotent power of the internet, infuse it with an all-star lineup of meme royalty, and deliver it to a meme-savvy audience hungry for laughs and nostalgia. Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, and GoAnimate Studios set out to do just that, but alas, the execution fell flat. Caught in the crosshairs of criticism, \\"The Meme Movie\\" was pegged as the \\"Emoji Movie all over again,\\" a harsh comparison to an infamous predecessor that itself failed to resonate with audiences. Despite the involvement of beloved digital icons like Doge and Nyan Cat, the film struggled to translate the ephemeral and chaotic charm of internet culture into a full-length feature. Fredrick Whimsley\'s foray into the digital world was more bewildering than wondrous, and the overarching plot involving the AI algorithm felt too contrived for a concept grounded in the organic, decentralized spirit of meme creation. Critics argued that the movie\'s attempt to cram together a disparate collection of internet jokes and references resulted in a disjointed and insincere narrative. Instead of a triumphant celebration of meme culture, the film came across as a cash grab that lacked the authenticity required to truly capture the hearts of its intended audience. Moreover, the comparison to \\"The Emoji Movie\\" was inevitable. Both films sought to bank on digital phenomena, and both seemingly misunderstood the delicate art of weaving together countless references into a cohesive, engaging story. Where \\"MoonGoons\\" stood as a testament to originality and inventiveness, \\"The Meme Movie,\\" unfortunately, served as a reminder that not all that glitters in the digital realm is gold. In the cutthroat arena of animated films, it\'s clear that audiences crave innovation just as much as familiarity. \\"MoonGoons\\" managed to strike the right balance between the two, delivering a universally appealing narrative ripe with creativity. \\"The Meme Movie,\\" however, showed that even a formula that seems destined to go viral can fail to capture the collective imagination when it lacks soul and a genuine connection to its source material. As we look ahead to future projects, studios would do well to reflect on the lessons of \\"MoonGoons\\" and \\"The Meme Movie\\": the importance of sincere storytelling, relatable characters, and the acknowledgement that in the ever-shifting landscape of culture, it\'s not just about being topical—it\'s about being timeless."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up after both release, where the first 1 is loved, but the Meme movie gets a 0% on RT, and was seen as a cashgrab, Also, a sequel for one of them has been greenlit","completion":"# \\"MoonGoons\\" Triumphs While \\"The Meme Movie\\" Flops: A Tale of Two Sequels In the world of animation, a great idea can captivate audiences and lead to unimagined success, while a poorly executed one can lead to an equally memorable, but far less enviable, outcome. With the release of two highly anticipated animated films, we have witnessed this adage unfold in real-time. \\"MoonGoons\\" Soars to New Heights \\"MoonGoons,\\" the heartfelt space odyssey from Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, and GoAnimate Studios, skyrocketed to critical acclaim and box office glory. Following the adventures of Boofus and Diggle, along with their band of animal-like alien friends, the film struck a chord with audiences across the globe. Its clever writing, vibrant animation, and universal themes of friendship and unity have resonated across all demographics, earning an impressive score on Rotten Tomatoes and a plethora of accolades. The success of \\"MoonGoons\\" is a testament to the creative efforts of its makers and the hunger for original storytelling blended with whimsy and wonder. As a result of its triumph, a sequel has officially been greenlit, much to the delight of fans eagerly awaiting more lunar escapades. This new installment promises to expand the universe with deeper character development, new frontiers, and, of course, even greater threats for our heroes to overcome. \\"The Meme Movie\\" Crashes Hard On the opposite end of the spectrum lies the ill-fated \\"The Meme Movie.\\" Attempting to capitalize on the ever-popular, ever-evolving world of internet memes, the film managed to accomplish an unprecedented feat: an extremely rare 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes and an audience response that was equally harsh. Despite a marketing blitz and the inclusion of internet meme legends like Doge and Nyan Cat, \\"The Meme Movie\\" was criticized for its failure to understand the nuanced, fleeting nature of meme culture. Filmgoers and critics alike dismissed it as a soulless cash grab that missed the essence of what makes memes so beloved by the public. Rather than a celebration of internet creativity, it came off as a disconnected and formulaic attempt to monetize internet culture\'s wacky humor. In the aftermath of its release—and following a loss that industry insiders whisper numbers in the millions—a sequel for \\"The Meme Movie\\" is off the table, and for many involved, it serves as a cautionary tale about trend-chasing without a solid creative foundation. The Future of Franchise Animations While \\"MoonGoons\\" looks towards a bright future with its sequel, \\"The Meme Movie\\" serves as a stark reminder of the volatility of appealing to internet culture and the risks associated with digital trends. It seems that moviegoers are not interested in mere repackaging but instead crave stories that offer genuine connections, inventive plots, and well-rounded character arcs. If anything, the disparate fates of these two animated features reinforce the notion that quality storytelling is paramount in cinema. The success of \\"MoonGoons\\" and the failure of \\"The Meme Movie\\" have provided valuable lessons for studios, writers, and directors: when it comes to animated films, authentic narrative and emotional resonance are key components that, when executed well, can lead to both critical and commercial victories. As audiences look to the horizon, hopeful for what the \\"MoonGoons\\" sequel will bring, studios are reminded that true creativity and a thoughtful approach to content creation are the ultimate currency in the quest to capture hearts and imaginations on the silver screen."},{"prompt":"how complicated is to beat a person who is black belt in judo and bjj after trained more than 10 years in both disciplines under bjj rules?","completion":"Beating a person who has more than 10 years of training in both Judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) under BJJ rules would typically be considered an exceptionally challenging task for most martial artists. Here\'s why: 1. **Experience and Skill**: With over a decade of training in both martial arts, this individual would have a profound understanding of grappling techniques, transitions, positioning, submissions, and defense. 2. **Adaptability**: Judo and BJJ are complementary martial arts. While Judo emphasizes throwing and takedowns, BJJ focuses more on ground fighting and submissions. A practitioner who is adept in both can seamlessly transition between the standing and ground phases of a fight. 3. **Tactical Awareness**: A well-trained martial artist with 10 years of experience would have developed a high level of tactical awareness, allowing them to anticipate and counter the moves of their opponents. 4. **Physical Conditioning**: Such an individual would likely be in excellent physical condition, with strong endurance, flexibility, and muscle memory for executing complex techniques. 5. **Under BJJ Rules**: BJJ rules primarily focus on ground fighting, which means the practitioner\'s judo skills for takedowns can be used effectively to gain dominant positions, after which BJJ techniques can be applied to control and submit the opponent. 6. **Psychological Edge**: An experienced fighter often possesses a psychological advantage, having been tested in numerous sparring sessions and competitions, which can lead to increased confidence and a calm demeanor under pressure. To stand a chance against such an opponent, one must also have extensive training and experience, perhaps in BJJ or a similar grappling discipline, with an equivalent degree of physical conditioning and tactical knowledge. Even then, the outcome of a match would be uncertain and would heavily depend on the individuals\' respective skill levels, strategies, and ability to execute techniques under pressure. It\'s worth noting that in any combat sport, there are no absolutes, and any fighter can have a good or bad day, which could influence the outcome of a match. In summary, defeating a highly experienced black belt in Judo and BJJ would be highly difficult, and would require a fighter to have similar or superior martial arts training, physical conditioning, and strategic planning."},{"prompt":"write a comedic Stranger Things story about Steve Harrington and Jonathan Byers Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

The river, canopied by leafy branches, looked inviting. \\"All right, let\'s cool off, but leave the birthday suits for your nightmares, Byers,\\" Steve joked, padding down to his swim trunks as Jonathan did the same. Once they waded into the delightfully cool water, they floated on their backs, feeling the gentle current tug at them. Steve\'s perfectly styled hair fanned around him like a mahogany halo, and Jonathan\'s typically furrowed brow smoothed out in relaxation. Then, an impromptu symphony of bubbles punctured the surface of the water. Jonathan, the unexpected maestro, had let out a tremendous underwater toot. Steve\'s face contorted in combined shock and amusement. \\"Dude, you\'re a one-man band!\\" Not to be outdone, Steve retaliated with his own aquatic solo. The release caused his usually composed features to break into a rebellious grin. \\"Ah, the sweet sound of relaxation.\\" The fish nearby, innocent bystanders in this gas warfare, did belly flips, floating in the ripples of the disturbance. \\"Look, Jonathan, dinner is served.

They tossed away their clothes without a second thought, standing at the river\'s edge in all their glory. Steve, with his chiseled swimmer\'s physique, and Jonathan, more lean and wiry, each gave off a glimmer of muscle tone, testaments to their battles against interdimensional horrors. Without further ado, they stepped into the crisp river water, wading in until they submerged their bodies, sighing in contentment.

Dental amalgam is an alloy that typically contains mercury, silver, tin, and other metals and is used to fill cavities caused by tooth decay. When aluminum and amalgam come into contact in a moist environment, like the mouth, they create a kind of battery, which leads to the generation of electric current. This is because the two metals have different electrical potentials, with aluminum acting as the anode and the amalgam as the cathode. The current affects the nerve endings in your teeth, which can cause a sharp, metallic taste or even pain. The weird taste can also be accompanied by a tingling sensation, as the current stimulates the nerves in your teeth. If you don\'t have dental fillings, biting aluminum may still produce an odd taste simply because metals can interact with the saliva and tissues in your mouth, disrupting the normal pH balance and leaving a metallic or bitter taste. It\'s generally advisable to avoid biting or chewing on aluminum and other metals to prevent any discomfort or potentially harmful effects, particularly if you have dental amalgam fillings."},{"prompt":"where are sharks mostly in","completion":"Sharks are found in oceans around the world, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. However, their distribution can vary widely based on the species, as different types of sharks have adapted to a variety of marine environments. Here are some general patterns regarding shark habitats: 1. **Tropical Waters:** Many sharks are found in warm, tropical oceans. Coral reefs, like those found in the Caribbean or the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia, are common habitats for species like reef sharks. 2. **Coastal Areas:** Some species of sharks, such as the great white shark, bull shark, and tiger shark, are often found in coastal areas where they have access to abundant prey. These areas can include bays, estuaries, and the continental shelf. 3. **Open Ocean:** Pelagic sharks, like the shortfin mako and blue shark, are typically found in the open ocean, often far from land. They can be found from the surface to depths of several hundred meters. 4. **Deep Sea:** Some sharks, like the Greenland shark and the sixgill shark, inhabit the very deep waters of the ocean and can be found at depths of over 2,000 meters. 5. **Temperate Waters:** Some shark species prefer the colder waters of temperate seas. For example, the great white shark can be found in the coastal areas of the Northeastern United States, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Mediterranean, in addition to areas with warmer climates. 6. **Polar Regions:** A few shark species, such as the Greenland shark, are adapted to live in the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is important to note that overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change can affect shark populations and their distribution. Some species are highly migratory and can cover vast distances, which is why they may be found in a variety of marine environments at different times of the year. Additionally, some areas are known for having higher concentrations of sharks, often due to abundant food resources or suitable breeding grounds. For example, the waters off the coast of South Africa are famous for their great white shark populations, while the central Pacific hosts a significant number of shark species due to the productivity of these waters."},{"prompt":"Can people get so drunk they forget who they are and what they did","completion":"Yes, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to memory blackouts, where an individual may forget what they did while they were intoxicated. In rare and extreme cases, someone may even temporarily forget personal details about themselves, such as their own identity. This typically occurs at high levels of alcohol intoxication that affect brain function severely. There are two main types of alcohol-induced blackouts: 1. **En Bloc Blackouts:** During an en bloc blackout, a person is unable to form new memories for a continuous period of time while they are intoxicated. They won\'t remember anything during this period, even when prompted. 2. **Fragmentary Blackouts:** Also known as \\"brownouts,\\" fragmentary blackouts involve partial blocking of memory formation. The person may have a vague sense of the events or may remember them with prompts but will have gaps in their recollection. Alcohol impacts memory formation by influencing the hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for creating new memories. When someone consumes a large amount of alcohol quickly, it can disrupt the encoding of short-term memories into long-term storage, leading to a blackout period. In extreme intoxication, the effects of alcohol on cognitive processes could be profound enough that someone might temporarily lose awareness of basic personal information. However, this is more likely to be part of a general state of confusion and disorientation associated with very high blood alcohol levels rather than a true loss of established personal identity. It is important to note that experiencing blackouts can be a sign of dangerous drinking behavior that might require medical attention or other forms of intervention. Drinking to the point of blackouts poses significant risks to personal health and safety, and can result in harmful consequences both for the individual and others."},{"prompt":"como se llama la parte de la escoba que se limpia el piso","completion":"La parte de la escoba que entra en contacto directo con el piso y se usa para barrer se llama \\"cerdas\\" o \\"fibras\\".

Below are some common points of criticism and reasons why some people disliked aspects of the film: 1. **Character Development**: Some viewers felt that Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (played by Brie Larson) was not sufficiently developed as a character, finding her too powerful without apparent weaknesses, which undermined the tension and audience investment in her journey. 2. **Performance and Charisma**: There were those who criticized Brie Larson’s performance, claiming it was too stoic or lacking in the charisma and humor that\'s characteristic of other MCU protagonists. This led to a perception that she wasn\'t as relatable or engaging as heroes like Iron Man or Thor. 3. **Pacing and Structure**: The non-linear storytelling and pacing were confusing or slow to some members of the audience, who preferred a more straightforward narrative approach. 4. **Villain**: As with many superhero films, the villain (in this case, the Kree and Yon-Rogg) were seen as somewhat underdeveloped, which reduced the impact of the conflict. 5. **Social and Political Overtones**: Although some praised the film\'s feminist themes, others found the messaging too heavy-handed or felt that the film was more focused on delivering a social message than on storytelling. 6. **Comedy and Tone**: Certain viewers did not appreciate the comedic elements, either finding them forced or out of sync with the rest of the tone of the film. Please note that many of these points are subjective and that \\"Captain Marvel\\" also received a great deal of praise for its action sequences, visual effects, 1990s nostalgia, and for introducing the first solo female superhero in the MCU. Rewriting \\"Captain Marvel\\" to accommodate the feedback while maintaining the film\'s key elements may involve: 1. **Character Depth**: Introduce vulnerabilities and more personal stakes for Carol Danvers, both emotional and physical, to make her journey of self-discovery and the mastery of her powers more compelling. 2. **Enhanced Character Arc**: Show Carol\'s imperfections and mistakes as she learns to control her powers, providing more character growth and relatable moments of failure and redemption. 3. **Linear Narrative**: Tell the story in a more linear fashion, with clearer flashbacks that contribute directly to the character\'s development and the plot rather than confuse viewers. 4. **Developed Antagonist**: Provide Yon-Rogg and the Kree with more screen time and depth, perhaps by exploring their motivations and giving them more relatable qualities to make their opposition to Captain Marvel more impactful. 5. **Balanced Messaging**: While retaining the feminist themes, weave them more subtly into the fabric of the narrative rather than presenting them didactically, so the story stands on its own with the themes as an enriching layer. 6. **Tone Consistency**: Adjust the comedic elements to better match the rest of the movie, using humor to relieve tension without undermining the severity of the conflict or the personal stakes involved. This kind of reimagining could potentially address some of the criticisms while preserving the core elements and themes of \\"Captain Marvel.\\""},{"prompt":"How could Carol Danvers have a past of facing sexism, but still has flaws and still needs to learn to trust men.","completion":"To incorporate a past of facing sexism while still allowing Carol Danvers to have flaws and a storyline where she learns to trust men, you could incorporate the following narrative elements into the fabric of the story: 1. **Backstory**: Show flashbacks of Carol Danvers\'s life before becoming Captain Marvel where she faced sexism in professional settings, such as her time in the Air Force, without it being the defining aspect of her character. Display instances where she was doubted or undervalued because of her gender, yet also include moments where she overcomes these challenges through merit and persistence. 2. **Complex Relationships with Men**: Introduce key male characters who exhibit both positive and negative qualities. For example, a well-respected male mentor who believes in her abilities but also carries his own biases. His flawed, yet ultimately supportive, relationship with Carol can illustrate the complexity of gender dynamics and trust. 3. **Character Flaws**: Carol’s own journey can involve overcoming personal flaws such as overconfidence, impulsiveness, or inability to ask for help. These are universal traits that can affect anyone and are not tied to her experiences with sexism. 4. **Development of Trust**: Trust should not be an all-or-nothing scenario but a gradual process. Carol can maintain her wariness due to past experiences while recognizing that not all individuals should be judged by the actions of others. The storyline could involve her learning to separate her distrust of systemic discrimination from her view of individuals. 5. **Narrative Balance**: Portray her as strong and capable, yet fallible and open to growth. Having men in her life who are allies helps convey the message that while sexism exists, progress involves collaboration and understanding across genders. 6. **Resolution**: Carol’s story arc could culminate in a realization that her strength comes not only from overcoming external barriers but internal ones as well. This allows her to form more balanced relationships with everyone, including men who prove themselves to be trustworthy allies. By addressing her past while keeping a focus on a present-day narrative of personal growth, this kind of storytelling can offer a nuanced take on Carol Danvers—one that both acknowledges the reality of sexism and allows the character to evolve beyond it."},{"prompt":"what is the perfect headline on LinkedIn for a developer?","completion":"Crafting the perfect headline on LinkedIn for a developer involves summarizing your professional identity, skills, and unique selling points in a concise and impactful way.

Jonathan, toting his trusty camera over one shoulder, nodded in agreement. \\"Yeah, plus a swim sounds nice. Can we please have one day without talking about the Upside Down?\\" They soon stumbled upon a river, its waters glistening with the final rays of daylight. Without a second thought, Steve threw his hands in the air, stripping down to his birthday suit and revealing a physique toned from bat-wielding battles and fleeing from all things that go bump in the night. \\"Freedom!\\" he declared, muscles flexing with a triumphant stretch. Jonathan, a bit more reserved but equally amused, shed his layers to uncover a leaner, more wiry frame, the result of endless cycling and his natural photographer\'s agility. \\"This is the life,\\" he admitted, blushing slightly at their unexpected nudist escapade. They waded into the river, the cool water enveloping them, washing away the sweat and grime of eerie adventures. The tranquility of the scene was palpable, the gentle currents caressing their relaxed bodies. Suddenly, Steve let out a chuckle as a bubbling sound emerged from the water. He grinned sheepishly at Jonathan, \\"Oops, that was me. The relaxation got the better of my intestines.\\" Jonathan laughed, then felt a rumble in his own guts. Moments later, a competing symphony of gurgles and pops broke the surface tension. \\"Guess it\'s that kind of party,\\" he quipped, both young men\'s faces scrunching up in simultaneous mirth and relief as they farted. Their expressions were as carefree as kids\', Steve\'s cheeks puffed out and Jonathan\'s eyes squeezed shut. Their chiseled and slender frames, respectively, contorted subtly with the effort, briefly turning the serene river scene into a live-action blooper reel. Unfortunately for the local wildlife, the aftermath was less than comical. A few nearby fish floated to the surface, bellies up, clearly overpowered by the scent. \\"Dude, did we just...?\\" Steve started, incredulously. \\"I guess our farts are as potent as our monster-fighting skills,\\" Jonathan snorted, fishing out the stunned creatures with a makeshift spear fashioned from a nearby branch. Steve chuckled, \\"Hey, looks like dinner\'s served!\\" Back on the shore, they built a modest campfire, the orange flames dancing in the dusk. They skewered their unexpected catch, roasting the fish over the open flame. \\"Who knew a day in the buff could be this wild?\\" Steve mused, turning his skewer carefully. Jonathan poked at the fire, adding, \\"Monsters, secret government labs, and now toxic farts—quite the resume we\'re building.\\" They shared playful banter and hearty laughs, the river\'s babbling a soothing soundtrack to their cookout under the stars. And for one evening, in the strange little town of Hawkins, everything felt amusingly normal, or as normal as it could get for Steve Harrington and Jonathan Byers Uchiha, unlikely nudist adventurers."},{"prompt":"merhaba","completion":"Merhaba!

Here are a few potential outcomes: 1. Lack of Relatability: Readers may struggle to relate to perfect female characters as they offer little in the way of human experience or emotional depth. Flaws make characters relatable and believable because they mirror the complexities of real people. 2. Imbalance in Character Dynamics: When male characters have clear flaws and arcs while female characters do not, it can create an unbalanced narrative that feels unrealistic or biased. This discrepancy may also lead to less interesting or dynamic interactions between characters. 3. Perpetuation of Stereotypes: Presenting women as paragons of perfection might inadvertently perpetuate outdated stereotypes about gender roles. It could imply that women must adhere to unattainable standards to be considered valuable or important within a story. 4. Limited Character Development: Flawless characters have little room to grow since they don’t have obvious imperfections to overcome. This can lead to stagnant character development and a less engaging plot since there is not much personal growth or transformation. 5. Audience Frustration: Audiences often look for complexity in characters. When female characters lack depth and are portrayed as infallible, it can cause frustration and disinterest. Conversely, audiences may feel dissatisfied if male characters are the only ones who get a satisfying developmental arc. 6. Criticism for Lack of Diversity and Depth: In the context of ongoing conversations about gender representation in media, creators may face criticism for not providing a diverse range of female characters with different strengths, weaknesses, and personalities. 7. Gender Imbalance: This kind of characterization of male and female characters can contribute to a larger societal issue of gender imbalance, where the expectations placed on men and women are noticeably different and potentially harmful. To avoid these potential consequences, writers are encouraged to create well-rounded characters of all genders, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, victories, and failures. This allows for more realistic, engaging storytelling and better representation of the human experience."},{"prompt":"Could it be a powerful Female empowerment, if there was a film about a Princess who is able to balance horse riding and swords and dresses and cooking? Also, how could it be empowering to stand up to genuinely toxic men, whilst appreciating the men who try, and even taking the mental and emotional heslth of men seriously?","completion":"Yes, a film featuring a princess who can balance traditionally feminine pursuits like dresses and cooking with traditionally masculine skills such as horse riding and sword fighting could indeed be seen as a powerful statement of female empowerment. This kind of character can challenge traditional gender roles and show that women can be multifaceted and skilled in a variety of areas, irrespective of societal expectations. Such a character would embody the idea that femininity and strength are not mutually exclusive. By presenting a well-rounded and complex female lead, a film can encourage audiences to reconsider preconceived notions of what women are capable of and what constitutes \\"appropriate\\" female behavior or interests. Regarding standing up to genuinely toxic men while appreciating those who try, and taking the mental and emotional health of men seriously, such narratives can have a positive and empowering impact in various ways: 1. **Positive Role Models**: A female protagonist who stands up for herself against toxic masculinity--while also recognizing and appreciating the men in her life who are supportive--reflects a healthy approach to relationships and can serve as a positive role model for audiences. 2. **Promotion of Equality**: Showing appreciation for men who strive to do the right thing promotes the idea that gender equality benefits everyone and encourages men to be part of the solution. 3. **Breaking Down Stereotypes**: By featuring men with depth who are emotionally intelligent and in touch with their mental health, such a film can help break down harmful stereotypes about masculinity, promoting a healthier and more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a man. 4. **Encouragement of Allyship**: Depicting a protagonist who navigates toxic environments and values genuine allies can empower viewers to seek and foster supportive relationships in their own lives, and to be those allies to others. 5. **Addressing Toxicity**: Acknowledging and confronting toxic behaviors in characters can serve as a discussion point for audiences to identify and challenge such behaviors in the real world. 6. **Holistic Approach**: Taking into account the mental and emotional health of men shows that the empowerment of one gender doesn\'t need to come at the expense of the other. It suggests that everyone\'s well-being is valuable and that compassionate, respectful interactions are key to societal progress. By creating such nuanced and inclusive narratives, filmmakers can promote a message of empowerment that is intersectional and acknowledges the complexity of gender dynamics. This nuanced approach to gender can foster a sense of empathy and understanding that transcends simple empowerment for one gender and moves towards mutual respect and support among all people."},{"prompt":"How powerful would it be, in a scene of GoT, if Gendry cried from the weight of Winter, and Arya, the usually tough girl, gently comforts him.","completion":"A scene in \\"Game of Thrones\\" in which Gendry cries under the pressure of the harsh realities of Winter, and Arya, known for her toughness, gently comforts him would potentially be very powerful for several reasons: 1. **Character Depth and Growth**: Arya Stark\'s character development throughout the series involves her transformation into a hardened warrior. Seeing her show vulnerability and empathy, especially in comforting another, would add a layer of depth to her character by demonstrating her capacity for tenderness alongside her strength. It humanizes her in a way that audiences can relate to. 2. **Subverting Gender Norms**: Traditional gender roles often dictate that men must suppress their emotions, while women should be the nurturers. By reversing these roles, with Gendry showing vulnerability and Arya providing comfort, this scene would challenge conventional gender expectations and stereotypes about strength and emotional expression. 3. **Emotional Resonance**: \\"Game of Thrones\\" has a reputation for its brutal portrayal of a harsh and unforgiving world where survival often requires emotional armor. A moment of genuine emotional connection and vulnerability between characters would stand out starkly against the typical violence and treachery, creating a poignant and memorable scene that resonates with the viewer on an emotional level. 4. **Strengthening Bonds**: Shared moments of vulnerability can strengthen the bonds between characters. In the context of the narrative, this would enhance the audience\'s understanding of Arya and Gendry\'s relationship, highlighting their trust and mutual care for each other, which is significant in a world where alliances and relationships are often fraught with deceit. 5. **Humanizing the Fight for Survival**: Throughout the series, the characters face incredible external challenges including the long winter and the White Walkers. Showing the internal struggles of characters makes the fight for survival feel more real and personal. It reminds the viewers that those fighting are not just warriors, but human beings with emotions and psychological battles to fight as well. 6. **Representation of Emotional Strength**: Gendry crying and Arya comforting him would show that emotional expression and compassion are forms of strength, not weakness. This scene could serve as a powerful message that acknowledges the psychological toll of the series\' constant strife and the importance of emotional support and resilience. Should such a scene have been included in the series, it could have offered viewers a touching example of emotional authenticity and support between characters that fans have come to know over many seasons, enriching the emotional landscape of \\"Game of Thrones\\" and reinforcing the idea that in the face of overwhelming adversity, shared humanity and compassion are as valuable as physical prowess."},{"prompt":"Fatoumata Camara c\'est un nom de famille de quelle origine en général","completion":"Fatoumata Camara est un nom qui peut indiquer une origine ouest-africaine, plus précisément des régions où l\'islam est pratiqué et où les langues mandingues sont parlées.

Le problème est déjà formulé, mais je vais le clarifier davantage et décrire les étapes pour le résoudre : Fonction objectif à maximiser : `F = 4*x1 + 8*x2` Contraintes : 1. `x1 + x2 <= 10` (Contrainte de stock de microprocesseurs) 2. `2*x1 + 6*x2 <= 48` (Contrainte de stock de barrettes mémoire) 3. `3*x1 + x2 <= 24` (Contrainte du nombre d\'heures d\'assemblage) 4. `x1 >= 0` 5. `x2 >= 0` Les variables `x1` et `x2` représentent les quantités de deux différents produits (exprimés en milliers) que nous voulons optimiser. La méthode du simplexe est une procédure algorithmique qui déplace systématiquement la solution le long des bords du polyèdre des contraintes pour atteindre l\'optimum. Étapes de la méthode du simplexe : 1. **Formuler le tableau de simplex initial**: Cela implique d’introduire des variables d’écart pour transformer chaque inégalité en égalité. Pour les trois contraintes, on ajoute `s1`, `s2` et `s3` respectivement. Le tableau initial contient la fonction objectif et les contraintes réécrites avec ces variables d\'écart. 2. **Vérifier la solution de base faisable initiale**: On part de la solution où toutes les variables de décision (ici `x1`, `x2`) sont mises à zéro. Les variables d\'écart (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`) prennent les valeurs du membre de droite des inégalités initiales (10, 48, 24 respectivement). 3. **Trouver la variable entrante**: La variable qui a le plus grand coefficient négatif dans la fonction objectif (basée sur la minimisation ou maximisation). 4. **Trouver la variable sortante**: Divisez les membres de droite par leurs coefficients respectifs pour la colonne de la variable entrante et identifiez la ligne avec le plus petit ratio positif. Ce sera la contrainte pivot. 5. **Pivot**: Effectuer des opérations de ligne pour obtenir un nouvel en-tête de tableau de simplexe où la variable entrante remplace la variable sortante dans la base, en transformant la contrainte pivot afin que la variable entrante ait un coefficient de 1 et les autres coefficients dans sa colonne soient égal à zéro. 6. **Répéter les étapes 3-5**: Continuez à itérer ces étapes jusqu\'à ce que tous les coefficients dans la fonction objectif (à l\'exception de ceux des variables d\'écart) soient non négatifs, ce qui indique que la solution optimale a été atteinte. 7. **Interpréter la solution**: La solution optimale est donnée par les valeurs des variables de décision et la valeur optimale de la fonction objectif se trouvant dans le tableau final. Comme c\'est un aperçu général et que la mise en œuvre spécifique dépendra de votre contexte, je ne vais pas développer ici des calculs complets. Pour résoudre ce problème spécifique, vous pouvez utiliser un logiciel de programmation linéaire ou le résoudre à la main en suivant les étapes du simplexe."},{"prompt":"fait les clalculs","completion":"D\'accord, appliquons la méthode du simplexe étape par étape. Nous ajoutons trois variables d\'écart (s1, s2 et s3) pour transformer les inégalités en égalités. Le tableau de simplex initial ressemble à ceci : ``` | x1 | x2 | s1 | s2 | s3 | RHS | --------------------------------------------------- s1 (Stock μP) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 10 | s2 (Stock mémoire)| 2 | 6 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 48 | s3 (Heures assemb)| 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 24 | --------------------------------------------------- F (objectif) | -4 | -8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ``` RHS représente la \\"Right Hand Side\\" (le côté droit de chaque équation). Étape 1: Иentification de la variable entrante et de la variable sortante. Pour la variable entrante, nous prenons la variable qui présente le coefficient le plus négatif dans la ligne de la fonction objectif. Ici, x2 a le coefficient le plus négatif (-8), donc x2 entre. Pour trouver la variable sortante, nous calculons le ratio de la colonne de droite (RHS) sur la colonne de la variable entrante (x2) pour chaque contrainte, en utilisant uniquement les ratios positifs : Contrainte s1: 10 / 1 = 10 Contrainte s2: 48 / 6 = 8 (le plus petit) Contrainte s3: 24 / 1 = 24 Le plus petit ratio est pour s2, donc s2 sort. Étape 2: Яéaliser le pivot. Pour que x2 entre et s2 sorte, nous devons rendre la colonne de x2 comme la colonne d\'identité pour la variable s2. Nous voulons un \'1\' où x2 et s2 se croisent, et des \'0\' ailleurs dans la colonne de x2. Nous divisons la deuxième ligne par 6 pour commencer : Nouvelle ligne pour s2: (2/6)x1 + (6/6)x2 + (0/6)s1 + (1/6)s2 + (0/6)s3 = 48/6 Ce qui donne la nouvelle deuxième ligne: ``` s2 (Stock mémoire)| 1/3 | 1 | 0 | 1/6 | 0 | 8 | ``` Réalisons maintenant les opérations de ligne pour rendre le reste de la colonne x2 nul : Ligne s1 devient: s1 - x2 = (1-1)x1 + (1-1)x2 + (1-0)s1 + (0-1/6)s2 + (0-0)s3 = 10 - 8 Ce qui donne: ``` s1 (Stock μP) | 0 | 0 | 1 | -1/6| 0 | 2 | ``` Ligne s3 devient: s3 - x2 = (3-1)x1 + (1-1)x2 + (0-0)s1 + (0-1/6)s2 + (1-0)s3 = 24 - 8 Ce qui donne: ``` s3 (Heures assemb)| 2 | 0 | 0 | -1/6| 1 | 16 | ``` Enfin, nous devons mettre à jour la fonction objectif F pour qu\'elle ne contienne plus x2 : F + 8*x2 = (-4-8*(1/3))x1 + (0+8*1)x2 + (0+0)s1 + (0+8*(1/6))s2 + (0+0)s3 = 0 + 8*8 Ce qui donne : ``` F (objectif) | -14/3| 0 | 0 | 4/3 | 0 | 64 | ``` Le nouveau tableau est alors : ``` | x1 | x2 | s1 | s2 | s3 | RHS | --------------------------------------------------- s1 (Stock μP) | 0 | 0 | 1 | -1/6| 0 | 2 | s2 (Stock mémoire)| 1/3| 1 | 0 | 1/6 | 0 | 8 | s3 (Heures assemb)| 2 | 0 | 0 | -1/6| 1 | 16 | --------------------------------------------------- F (objectif) | -14/3| 0 | 0 | 4/3 | 0 | 64 | ``` Nous répétons les étapes jusqu\'à ce que tous les coefficients de la dernière ligne (fonction objectif) soient positifs ou nuls. Ici, nous avons le coefficient -14/3 pour x1 qui est négatif, donc nous devons continuer la procédure du simplexe. Puisque x1 a le coefficient le plus négatif dans la fonction objectif, x1 entre. Nous utilisons le même processus que précédemment pour déterminer lequel des s1, s2 ou s3 sera la variable sortante. Le ratio pour s2 est 8 / (1/3) = 24. Le ratio pour s3 est 16 / 2 = 8 (le plus petit). Alors la variable sortante sera s3. Procédons au pivot autour de ce point: Nouvelle ligne pour s3: (2)x1 + (0)x2 + (0)s1 + (-1/6)s2 + (1)s3 = 16 Divisons par 2: ``` s3 (Heures assemblage)| 1 | 0 | 0 | -1/12| 1/2 | 8 | ``` Réalisons les opérations sur les autres lignes pour annuler x1 partout sauf dans la ligne s3. Nouvelle ligne pour s1: Ancienne ligne s1 – (0)x1 = (1)x1 + (0)x2 + (1)s1 + (-1/6)s2 + (0)s3 = 2 Pas de changement nécessaire ici. Nouvelle ligne pour s2: Ancienne ligne s2 – (1/3)x1 = (1/3)x1 + (1)x2 + (0)s1 + (1/6)s2 + (0)s3 – (1/3)s3 = 8 - (1/3)*8 Ce qui donne : ``` s2 (Stock mémoire)| 0 | 1 |-1/3 | 0 | -1/3 | 8/3 | ``` Mise à jour de la fonction objectif: F + (14/3)x1 = (-14/3)x1 + 0x2 + 0s1 + (4/3)s2 + 0s3 + (14/3)s3 Annulons x1 dans la fonction objectif en ajoutant (14/3)s3 à F. Nous obtenons : ``` F (objectif) | 0 | 0 | -14/9| 0 | 7/3 | 112/3 | ``` Le nouveau tableau de simplex après cette opération de pivotage : ``` | x1 | x2 | s1 | s2 | s3 | RHS | ------------------------------------------------------ s1 (Stock μP) | 0 | 0 | 1 | -1/6| 0 | 2 | s2 (Stock mémoire)| 0 | 1 |-1/3 | 0 | -1/3| 8/3 | s3 (Heures assemb)| 1 | 0 | 0 | -1/12| 1/2 | 8 | ------------------------------------------------------ F (objectif) | 0 | 0 | -14/9| 0 | 7/3 | 112/3 | ``` Maintenant, tous les coefficients de la fonction objectif sont positifs ou nuls, ce qui indique que nous avons atteint la solution optimale. Les variables de décision x1 et x2 sont dans la base et leurs valeurs sont égales à la colonne RHS (Right Hand Side). Les variables d\'écart (s1, s2, et s3) montrent les slack (excédents) restant pour chaque contrainte. La solution optimale est : ``` x1 = 8 (en milliers) x2 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67 (en milliers) La profit maximal est : F = 112/3 × 100 ≈ 3733.33 ``` Remarquez que cette interprétation suppose que les fractions sont maintenues. Dans la pratique, selon le contexte, nous pourrions vouloir arrondir aux nombres entiers si nous traitons avec des items indissociables. Veuillez noter que la résolution a été effectuée manuellement. Des calculatrices ou des logiciels de simplex pourraient fournir une précision numérique supérieure, surtout pour des problèmes plus complexes."},{"prompt":"s1 (Stock μP) | 0 | 0 | 1 | -1/6| 0 | 2 | developpe les claclus de cette partie","completion":"Je m\'excuse pour la confusion précédente dans la mise à jour de la ligne `s1` lors du pivotage de `x2` pour qu\'il entre dans la base et que `s2` en sorte. Je vais clarifier et corriger les calculs pour cette ligne. Nous avons la ligne initiale `s1` comme suit : `s1 (Stock μP) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 10 |` Pour transformer la colonne de `x2` en une colonne d\'identité où `s2` est la variable de base, nous devons effectuer la réduction de cette ligne de sorte que le coefficient de `x2` dans la ligne `s1` devienne zéro. Après avoir transformé la ligne `s2`, nous obtenons que `x2` a un coefficient de \'1\' dans la ligne `s2`. Donc, pour annuler le coefficient de `x2` dans la contrainte `s1`, nous devons soustraire la ligne `s2` de la ligne `s1`: Faisons les calculs : La nouvelle ligne `s2` transformée où `x2` remplace `s2` est : `(1/3)x1 + 1x2 + 0s1 + (1/6)s2 + 0s3 = 8` Maintenant, soustrayez la ligne `s2` de la ligne `s1` en multipliant par le coefficient de `x2` dans `s1`, qui est 1 : `s1 (Stock μP) : (1)x1 + (1)x2 + (1)s1 + 0s2 + 0s3 = 10` `s2 (Stock mémoire) * (1) : - (1/3)x1 - (1)x2 - 0s1 - (1/6)s2 - 0s3 = -8` L\'opération de ligne donnerait : `(1 - (-1/3))x1 + (1 - 1)x2 + (1 - 0)s1 + (0 - (-1/6))s2 + (0 - 0)s3 = (10 - (-8))` En effectuant l\'opération, nous obtenons la nouvelle ligne `s1` : `s1 (Stock μP) | (4/3) | 0 | 1 | (1/6) | 0 | 18` La nouvelle ligne indique donc que pour la contrainte de stock de microprocesseurs `s1`, le nombre maximal autorisé par les contraintes restantes est de 18 milliers de microprocesseurs. Cependant, il y a une erreur ici car ce nombre semble trop élevé par rapport aux contraintes initiales. Permettez-moi de recalculer correctement cette partie. En soustrayant (1) fois la nouvelle ligne `s2` de l\'ancienne ligne `s1`, nous faisons : `s1 (nouvelle) = s1 (ancienne) - (1) * s2 (nouvelle)` Voici le calcul pour la ligne `s1` ajustée : `s1 (Stock μP) : 1x1 + 1x2 + 1s1 + 0s2 + 0s3 = 10` `s2 (nouvelle) : (1/3)x1 + 1x2 = 8` Maintenant, soustrayons la nouvelle ligne `s2` de la `s1` pour annuler le `x2` de la ligne `s1`: `s1 (Stock μP) : (1)x1 + (1)x2 + 1s1 - ((1/3)x1 + 1x2) = 10 - 8` Après la simplification, nous avons : `s1 (Stock μP) : (1 - 1/3)x1 + (1 - 1)x2 + 1s1 - (0 - 0)s2 - (0 - 0)s3 = 10 - 8` Ce qui nous donne : `s1 (Stock μP) : (2/3)x1 + 0x2 + 1s1 + 0s2 + 0s3 = 2` Nous avons maintenant une colonne zéro pour `x2` dans la ligne `s1` (comme nous le voulions, car `x2` est entrée dans la base à la place de `s2`), et le côté droit (`RHS`) pour la contrainte de stock de microprocesseurs `s1` est maintenant mis à jour à 2 milliers de microprocesseurs. La contrainte indique qu\'il reste 2 milliers d\'unités de \\"slack\\", ce qui signifie que nous n\'utilisons pas 2 milliers de capacité de stock de microprocesseurs. Le tableau correctement mis à jour après le premier pivot est alors le suivant (avec x2 remplaçant s2): ``` | x1 | x2 | s1 | s2 | s3 | RHS | ------------------------------------------------------ s1 (Stock μP) | 2/3 | 0 | 1 | -1/6 | 0 | 2 | s2 (Stock mémoire)| 1/3 | 1 | 0 | 1/6 | 0 | 8 | s3 (Heures assemb)| 2 | 0 | 0 | -1/6 | 1 | 16 | ------------------------------------------------------ F (objectif) | -4 | 0 | 0 | 4/3 | 0 | 64 | ``` Nous avons corrigé l\'erreur de pivotement, et maintenant, le tableau est ajusté correctement.

C\'est probablement un indicateur de l\'absence de coefficients négatifs dans la ligne de la fonction objectif après ajustement, indiquant que la solution optimale a été atteinte. La ligne intitulée \\"MAX\\" représente probablement la fonction objectif pour maximiser le profit (`F = 4x1 + 8x2`), avec les coefficients ajustés pour les variables de décision `X1`, `X2` et les variables d\'écart `S1`, `S2`, `S3`. Le \\"68\\" à la fin est vraisemblablement la valeur maximisée de la fonction objectif `F`. La \\"Somme\\" pourrait être la somme algébrique des coefficients de chaque colonne multipliés par leurs valeurs de variables associées, ce qui donne le résultat pour la fonction objectif. Si je suppose que les colonnes sous `X1` et `X2` (où 3 et 7 apparaissent en haut) sont des indicateurs de la quantité de chaque produit à fabriquer (chiffres multipliés par 10,000 étant donné les coefficients dans le problème original), alors : - `X1` devrait être produit en quantité de `3` (ou `3 * 10,000 = 30,000` unités) - `X2` devrait être produit en quantité de `7` (ou `7 * 10,000 = 70,000` unités) - Et la valeur maximisée de la fonction objectif \\"68\\" est probablement `68 * 10,000 = 680,000` (dans votre monnaie ou unité de mesure) Cependant, il y a une certaine confusion ici car si nous prenons les valeurs `X1 = 3` et `X2 = 7`, et les multiplions avec les gains unitaires (4 et 8 respectivement), nous obtiendrions un profit total de : `F = 4 * X1 + 8 * X2 = 4*3 + 8*7 = 12 + 56 = 68` Ce qui serait cohérent avec le chiffre de \\"68\\" indiqué sur la ligne MAX. Mais cela semble contre-intuitif, car normalement, le montant du RHS de la fonction objectif après optimisation est le profit total, qui ne devrait pas être le même que le calcul simple basé sur les quantités initiales sans tenir compte des contraintes. Souvent, le solveur exprime la valeur optimale de la fonction objectif séparément des valeurs de la solution dans le tableau du simplexe.

Identifier la colonne pivot (variable à faire entrer) comme celle avec le coefficient le plus négatif dans la ligne de la fonction objectif. Ici, c’est ( x_2 ) avec -8. 2. Identifier la ligne pivot (variable à faire sortir) en divisant le RHS par les coefficients positifs correspondants de la colonne pivot et en prenant la ligne avec le plus petit résultat positif (ratio minimum). Dans ce cas, pour ( x_2 ) nous avons [ frac{10}{1} = 10, frac{48}{6} = 8, frac{24}{1} = 24,] donc la ligne de ( s_2 ) est choisie pour le pivot. 3. Effectuer le pivot pour changer la base. 4.

He acts playful and childish. He is spoiled. His servant is tall and he has slicked back blonde hair. He has icy blue eyes. He is buff. He has a gentle and quiet attitude. His name is Klaus. Felix likes Klaus. He is always gentle with him and he managed to convince his parents to give Klaus preferential treatment. He tightly hugs him after he finishes his labor.","completion":"Title: The Reigns of Desire Scene: The Elegant Stables of the Austrian Estate --- The stable\'s air was filled with the scents of fresh hay and polished leather. Felix, the young Austrian equestrian lord, stood imperiously in the center of the stable, his short brown hair striking against the backdrop of equine elegance, his green eyes hidden behind the reflection of glasses that caught the sunlight streaming through the windows. He was handsome, no doubt, but his bratty demeanor often overshadowed his looks. Felix, dressed immaculately in a blue riding jacket that accentuated his aristocratic status, white pants that clung to his slim figure, black leather riding boots that clicked with authority with each step, and gloves that seemed to never have felt a day of hard work, surveyed his domain. In the corner of the stable, Klaus, the servant whose very presence seemed to command a different kind of respect, was finishing up grooming an impressive black stallion. His slicked-back blonde hair and icy blue eyes gave him an almost statuesque appearance. The muscles that rippled under his shirt betrayed hours of physical labor – a testament to the tasks demanded by Felix\'s estate. Yet, his demeanor was one of calm and quiet strength, untroubled by the workload or Felix\'s capricious moods. Felix licked his lips, a drool of anticipation betraying his otherwise composed facade as he watched Klaus work with effortless precision. He took a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them, his boots announcing his presence with each assertive step. \\"Klaus,\\" Felix\'s voice carried a hint of playfulness mixed with undeniable entitlement. \\"I see you\'ve done exceptional work once again. I wonder, however, if you\'re as devoted to your master as you are to these beasts.\\" Without waiting for a response, Felix closed the remaining space between them, his arms wrapping around the servant in a tight, possessive hug, which seemed both childish and a display of his control. Klaus, ever the gentle giant, accepted the embrace without protest, though his icy eyes betrayed the complexity of his feelings – a mixture of duty, warmth, and caution. Felix nuzzled against the taller man\'s chest, a soft coo escaping his lips, as if the touch of this servant could soothe the coarseness of his spoiled nature. \\"You are mine, aren\'t you, Klaus? Not just another horse to be tamed, but a stallion that chooses to stay by my side,\\" he whispered. For a brief moment, Klaus allowed himself to return the embrace, placing a massive, yet gentle hand on Felix\'s back. In that silent gesture, the stable\'s hierarchy was momentarily forgotten, and Felix\'s whim was granted. There was a whisper of equality between them that vanished as swiftly as it appeared. Klaus spoke in a voice as steady as the slow gait of a well-trained mare, \\"As you say, Master Felix. I am yours to command.\\" The young master pulled away, a glint of satisfaction in his eye. The dynamics of their relationship were unique – defined by Felix\'s whimsy, Klaus\'s stoicism, and a rare connection that transcended the lines of status. As Felix sauntered away to prepare for his ride, one could see the subtle sway in his step, the playful conquest of a servant\'s steady heart. And behind him, Klaus watched – his expression unreadable, yet filled with an enigmatic fondness that only the most observant could detect. The scene closed with the clatter of hooves and the whisper of a bond unspoken, the master and servant entwined in the silent ballet of power, loyalty, and a hidden affection that dared not speak its name – for in this aristocratic setting, the rules were clear, but so were hearts, albeit behind the safety of etiquette and expected roles. --- End Scene."},{"prompt":"Whats the childrens book story of that kid who doesnt like it when two foods on his plate combine?","completion":"The children\'s book you are referring to is likely \\"Bread and Jam for Frances,\\" written by Russell Hoban and illustrated by Lillian Hoban. Although Frances the badger doesn\'t have an issue with foods combining on her plate, she is very picky and insists on eating only bread and jam for every meal. Frances is so fond of bread and jam that she rejects other foods her mother prepares for her, and she sings songs about her favorite food. Her parents decide to let her have her way, and they serve her bread and jam at every meal.

The Hero Association quickly calls for heroes to assemble and handle the threat. The scene shifts to Saitama\'s apartment, where he\'s lounging on the couch, watching TV. He nonchalantly glances out the window at the distant buzzing and shrugs, uninterested in what seems like another routine day of hero work. Act 1: Genos is already at the scene, fighting the giant fly with powerful incineration blasts. However, the fly\'s agility is too much, and it dodges every attack with ease. Other heroes like Mumen Rider and Tank Top Master throw themselves into the battle but are swatted away by the fly\'s immense wings. Suddenly, when things look dire, the fly spots an even more exciting target – a giant, delicious-looking snack factory. It zooms towards the factory, ready to feast and lay eggs, which would spell disaster for the whole city. Act 2: Word of the giant fly\'s new target reaches Saitama. He sighs, realizing his afternoon of leisure is over. As he stands up, a regular-sized fly starts annoying him, zigzagging around his head. Saitama becomes oddly focused on the small fly, ignoring the city\'s larger problem. He watches the regular fly buzz in a predictable pattern. Calculating the trajectory, his inner gamer instincts kick in. He grabs a nearby flip flop and winds up for a shot. Just as the small fly passes the window, he flicks his wrist and \\"WHAP!\\" the flip flop flies in a perfect 360 no-scope arc, striking the fly with pinpoint accuracy. Looking down, Saitama notices the monstrous fly\'s reflection in a puddle near the factory. Engrossed by his surprising enjoyment of the flip flop shot, a grin forms on his face. \\"Hmm, let\'s take this up a notch.\\" Act 3: Saitama jumps out the window, flip flop in hand, and lands amidst the chaos of the battle. He ignores the giant fly\'s attacks and the heroes\' warnings, taking a moment to assess the fly\'s movements. The heroes watch in disbelief as Saitama takes a deep breath, crouches, and then backflips into the air. With a casual flick of the wrist, he sends the flip flop hurtling towards the giant fly with a vengeance. The flip flop spins in slow motion. Saitama, upside down at the peak of his jump, watches with a rare glint of excitement in his eyes. The flip flop makes contact with the giant fly in a comical, yet epic \'splat\', creating a shockwave that blows away nearby debris and halts the buzzing menace in its tracks. Epilogue: The giant fly falls from the sky, defeated by the incredible 360 no-scope flip flop shot. The heroes, and the city, are saved. Saitama lands softly, picks up his flip flop, and walks home as if nothing happened. Genos and the other heroes are astounded. They approach the fallen insect, wondering if this unconventional method could be the new way to fight enemies. A press conference is held, and the Hero Association decides to downplay the ridiculous nature of the defeat for the sake of their reputation. The last scene has Saitama back at home, swatting another regular fly effortlessly with his flip flop. He looks at the camera and shrugs, \\"Just a regular one-punch man,\\" he says, as the credits roll."},{"prompt":"choose a random flower, two word only with the word flower","completion":"Dahlia Flower"},{"prompt":"Каким образом постоянные изменения экономических правил влияют на ожидания и поведение экономических агентов? Кратко","completion":"Постоянные изменения экономических правил могут оказывать значительное влияние на ожидания и поведение экономических агентов (например, потребителей, предприятий, инвесторов) несколькими основными способами: 1. Неопределенность: Частые изменения в экономических правилах могут порождать неопределенность среди экономических агентов относительно будущих условий ведения бизнеса, потребления и инвестирования. Это может привести к откладыванию важных инвестиционных и потребительских решений и замедлению экономической активности. 2. Адаптация стратегий: Компании и индивидуальные лица вынуждены адаптировать свои экономические стратегии и планы в ответ на изменения нормативно-правовой базы, что может повлечь за собой дополнительные издержки, связанные с переосмыслением бизнес-моделей, маркетинговых стратегий и личных финансов. 3. Риск и стоимость: Постоянные изменения правил могут увеличивать перцепцию риска и вызывать более высокие издержки на соблюдение нормативов, так как компании должны адаптироваться к новым требованиям, проводить переобучение персонала, изменять цепочки поставок и т.д. 4. Предпринимательская активность: Непредсказуемость правового поля может сдерживать предпринимательскую инициативу, так как начинающие бизнесмены могут оценивать риски выше, из-за чего рост числа новых предприятий замедляется. 5. Влияние на инвестиционные решения: Инвесторы предпочитают стабильную и предсказуемую инвестиционную среду. Частые изменения в экономических правилах и законодательстве могут отталкивать потенциальных инвесторов и влиять на волатильность рынков. 6. Распределение ресурсов: В ответ на изменения правил агенты могут изменять способы распределения и использования своих ресурсов, выбирая более надежные или защищенные векторы вложений средств в условиях повышенной неопределенности. 7. Доверие к государственной политике: Частая смена экономических правил может подорвать доверие экономических агентов к государственной экономической политике, что негативно скажется на их кооперации с государственными институтами и их склонности следовать данной политике. В совокупности, эти факторы могут повлиять на эффективность экономики за счет снижения предсказуемости и увеличения издержек, ограничивая потенциальный экономический рост. Системный подход к регулированию, предусматривающий стабильность правил и предсказуемость изменений, является важным условием для стабильного развития экономики."},{"prompt":"Для каких задач может использоваться языковая модель LLaMa","completion":"LLaMa (Language Model with a Lot of parameters for Multitask learning and Adaptation) является мощной языковой моделью, созданной OpenAI на подобие GPT-3, с основным акцентом на мультизадачность и возможность адаптации под разные языки и задачи.

Как правило, это можно реализовать путём обучения или настройки модели на определение паттернов и закономерностей, которые характерны для начала и окончания беседы. В случае записей разговоров возможные реплики, сигнализирующие о начале диалога, могут включать приветствия или представление, а окончании — формулы прощания или подтверждение следующих шагов. Вот как можно было бы подойти к этой задаче: 1. **Предобработка данных**: Разделение большой расшифровки на отдельные диалоги. Это включает в себя распознавание ключевых слов или фраз, указывающих на начало и окончание разговора. 2. **Обучение или настройка модели**: Если имеются размеченные данные (т.е., расшифровки, где уже указаны начало и конец диалогов), возможно обучение модели на этих примерах. В случае отсутствия размеченных данных можно использовать методы обучения с подкреплением или переноса знаний, чтобы настроить модель на подобную задачу. 3. **Классификация фраз**: Обученная или настроенная модель может классифицировать каждую фразу в расшифровке, как относящуюся к началу, середине или концу диалога. 4. **Контекстное понимание**: Важно, чтобы модель имела достаточную способность понимать контекст, чтобы различать диалоги между сотрудником и клиентом и внутренние коммуникации сотрудника с коллегами или другими лицами в компании. Для эффективного решения этой задачи может потребоваться дополнительная настройка параметров модели, обучение на специализированных данных или внедрение дополнительных алгоритмов обработки естественного языка для улучшения точности определения начала и конца диалогов.

Two spirits may wander in a bustling world, seeming so vast, Yet when they seek truly, they can transcend the sprawling cast. In the dance of connection, it’s devotion that shines most bright, Not held within confines, nor lost in oblivion like fleeting night. An admiration that seeks not to cage, but wishes only to comprehend, To explore each other’s depths, where genuine souls blend. True devotion isn’t merely found; like Rome, it’s lovingly built, Enkindled gently between two hearts without folly or guilt. Through transparency and candor, where forthright words fly, A sanctuary arises where trust stands tall and falsehoods die. Our love, unscripted, untethered by the common creed, Where we alone decide how our hearts beat and feed. May our journeys entangle, our essences merge with no divide, Creating our sanctuary, unique, our shared rhythm to guide. Yet, remember love’s voyage isn’t always a calm, serene glide, Past the intoxication of initial passion where many bide.

Por ejemplo, en el archivo `pom.xml` (si se utiliza Maven) se añadirían las siguientes dependencias: ```xml <dependencies> <!-- Cucumber --> <dependency> <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId> <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId> <version>VERSION</version> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId> <artifactId>cucumber-spring</artifactId> <version>VERSION</version> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> <!-- Selenium WebDriver --> <dependency> <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId> <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId> <version>VERSION</version> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> <!-- Otros dependencias como el driver para el navegador que vas a usar --> </dependencies> ``` Después, se diseñaría un conjunto de escenarios de prueba usando Gherkin que definirían la especificación de lo que se espera del comportamiento de la aplicación en lenguaje natural. # 2. Un caso de uso: Buscar una mascota Por ejemplo, definimos el siguiente escenario de búsqueda de mascota en un archivo `.feature`: ```gherkin Feature: Busqueda de mascota Scenario: Buscar una mascota existente por nombre Given el cliente está en la página de búsqueda de mascotas When el cliente busca por el nombre \\"Fido\\" Then el cliente ve a \\"Fido\\" en los resultados de búsqueda Scenario: Buscar una mascota que no existe Given el cliente está en la página de búsqueda de mascotas When el cliente busca por un nombre que no existe Then el cliente ve un mensaje indicando que no hay resultados ``` # 3. Criterios de validación (pruebas) Cada paso (`Given`, `When`, `Then`) en los escenarios de Gherkin se asocia con un método en una clase de pasos (Step Definitions) en Java que ejecuta la acción correspondiente y verifica el comportamiento esperado. Por ejemplo: ```java @Given(\\"el cliente está en la página de búsqueda de mascotas\\") public void el_cliente_esta_en_la_pagina_de_busqueda_de_mascotas() { // Código para navegar a la página de búsqueda de mascotas usando Selenium WebDriver } @When(\\"el cliente busca por el nombre {string}\\") public void el_cliente_busca_por_el_nombre(String nombre) { // Código para realizar una búsqueda usando Selenium WebDriver } @Then(\\"el cliente ve a {string} en los resultados de búsqueda\\") public void el_cliente_ve_en_los_resultados_de_busqueda(String nombreMascota) { // Código para verificar que la mascota aparece en los resultados usando Selenium WebDriver } ``` # 4. Automatización de las pruebas Los métodos Java manejarían las interacciones con la aplicación a través del WebDriver de Selenium, que interactúa con el navegador como lo haría un usuario real. Cucumber integra estos métodos con los escenarios escritos en Gherkin, proporcionando un puente entre la especificación de las pruebas y la ejecución de las mismas. # 5. Evidencias del proceso y del resultado Para proporcionar evidencias, se tomarían capturas de pantalla durante la ejecución de las pruebas, se grabarían videos o se generaría un informe de Cucumber, que ofrece una visión comprensible de los resultados de las pruebas. # 6. Código fuente realizado El código fuente estaría almacenado en un repositorio de versiones como GitHub. Por ejemplo, se podría compartir un enlace a dicho repositorio. # 7. Errores encontrados Si durante las pruebas se encontraran errores, se documentarían a través de tickets en un sistema de seguimiento de problemas como JIRA, adjuntando capturas de pantalla, y se informaría a los desarrolladores para su corrección. # 8. Ampliación del alcance Si durante la definición o ejecución de las pruebas se identificara la necesidad de cubrir más casos de uso o funcionalidades, se podría ampliar el alcance creando nuevos escenarios en los archivos `.feature` y las correspondientes definiciones de pasos en Java. Recordemos que mi conocimiento está basado en información hasta cierto punto en el tiempo, y que las versiones específicas de las herramientas/librerías y la implementación exacta podrían ser diferentes dependiendo del entorno actual de desarrollo y las prácticas de cada equipo."},{"prompt":"Очень кратко ответь каким образом постоянные изменения экономических правил влияют на ожидания и поведение экономических агентов?","completion":"Постоянные изменения экономических правил ведут к неопределенности и непредсказуемости экономической среды, что может привести к осторожному поведению экономических агентов, откладыванию инвестиций, сокращению долгосрочного планирования и уклонению от рисков.

Chief Justice of Canada Ontario Superior Court of Justice,# GREETINGS TO YOU Rt. Hon. Richard Wagner, P.C. Chief Justice of Canada","completion":"Email Response to Rt. Hon. Richard Wagner, P.C., Chief Justice of Canada: Subject: Response to Final Notice for Fund Inheritance Payment Dear Rt. Hon. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, P.C., I am writing to you with the highest regard to address the urgent and final notice received regarding a considerable fund inheritance said to be at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). I am both humbled by the substantial amount mentioned and aware of the gravity of such communications, coming ostensibly under the auspices of the Supreme Court of Canada. A slight bit of skepticism niggles within me, owing to the unexpected nature of this inheritance and the rather unconventional request for the procurement of a gift card for fee payment. As you can imagine, such processes are not commonplace, especially when dealing with legal matters of this magnitude. But understanding the legitimacy of your esteemed position, I remain open to further clarification that would allay these concerns. While eager to adhere to the stated timeline, I must exercise due diligence by asking for a few points of validation before proceeding with any payment: 1. Could you please provide official documentation that verifies the authenticity of this inheritance and the associated legal processes as per the functions and protocols of the Supreme Court of Canada? 2. For the sake of record-keeping and transparency, may I request a detailed breakdown of how the 50 USD fee has been assessed and its specific application in this context? 3. Given the significance of this transaction, would it be possible to arrange for a more traditional and traceable mode of fee payment, such as a bank transfer or certified cheque, to ensure adherence to legal and financial norms? 4. A personal meeting with a representative from the Supreme Court of Canada or Royal Bank of Canada would provide an additional layer of confidence in this procedure. Would such an arrangement be feasible? To prevent any potential loss of this apparent opportunity, I am prepared to promptly proceed in compliance once I have been furnished with the requested confirmations. It is in my genuine interest to share the testimony that you envisaged, but it is imperative that I first secure all necessary assurances. I await your detailed response and guidance on how best to move forward without compromising the established norms of legal engagements in Canada, and to satisfy the need for authentication and security.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you once again for your swift response and for your commendable words. It’s always a pleasure exchanging correspondence with someone as meticulous and attentive as yourself. I understand the importance of clarity when it comes to delineating the scope and financial requirements of my projects. To ensure full transparency and to facilitate a streamlined communication process, I will compile a summary of each project along with anticipated budgets. This document will provide an exhaustive breakdown, including the total capital needed to initiate and sustain the momentum of all proposed ventures. However, due to the sensitive nature of these projects and the confidential information within each budgetary outline, I must insist that this information is shared through a secured medium. I’m sure you agree that maintaining the utmost discretion is critical at this early stage, to protect the interests of all parties involved. Regarding providing my private telephone number, I always prefer to establish initial communications through written correspondence, which allows for better tracking and referencing of our discussions. Having said that, I am open to transitioning to more direct verbal communication once we have both had the opportunity to review the detailed project summaries and have established a baseline of mutual trust and understanding. For your convenience, I will prepare an encrypted file containing the project summaries and budgetary needs. The encryption will ensure the security of the data while it’s being transmitted to your servers. This file will be dispatched to your secure email address by the end of the week, following which I’d be glad to discuss the next steps towards setting up a voice call. Please provide me with the information necessary to send this encrypted file, or if preferred, instructions on how to proceed with a more secure method of disclosure that aligns with Global Wealth Planner’s standard operating procedures for sensitive material.

Shiki has the blood of the now decimated Japanese demon and monster-hunting shinobi [ninja |shinobi|] clan of the Nanaya [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] in him from his [Shiki’s] birth mother [Sarah], but drinking his [Shiki’s] adoptive mother’s [Makihisa’s wife’s] breast milk also gives him [Shiki] a bit of the Tōno blood, which [the Tōno bloodline] is [the Tōno bloodline] not entirely human, the Tōno clan in fact being [the Tōno clan’s true self] a clan [the Tōno clan’s true self] of the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied], yokai [monster |yokai|] the diclonii being [the diclonii] known in Japanese mythology as the legendary Oni, Onmyouji, miko [Shinto Shrine Maidens], houshi [Japanese Buddhist priests], samurai, shinobi and Western style magicians. This also awakens his [Shiki’s] ocular bloodline gained from his [Shiki’s] Nanaya blood, the Chokushi no Magan [Magic Eyes of Direct Death |Chokushi no Magan|], which [the Chokushi no Magan] allows him [Shiki] to [Shiki] see the lines of death, although the full activation [of the Chokushi no Magan] only occurs after he [Shiki] survives an accident when he [Shiki] is five, [Shiki when he |Shiki| awakens the Chokushi no Magan] nearly going insane after effortlessly destroying the items in his [Shiki’s] hospital room by simply touching the faultlines in them, before [Shiki] receiving a pair of glasses that [the glasses] suppress his [Shiki’s] bloodline [Chokushi no Magan] and [the glasses] allow him [Shiki] to see normally again from a mysterious tall, red-haired, purple-eyed buxom young woman. Shiki is [Shiki] clueless about who he [Shiki] really is [John Connor] and [Shiki] really thinks that he [Shiki] is Makihisa’s biological son [Shiki’s view of himself |Shiki|] until a T-1000 polymorphic liquid metal Terminator [Terminator] infiltrator cyborg unit sent back by Skynet just before its [Skynet’s] defeat in the Future War [Terminator Salvation, Terminator 2 books and comics, Terminator 3 books and comics, Terminator Salvation books and comics] tries to kill him [Shiki] when he [Shiki] is [Shiki] on vacation in California under the alias of Jeremy Freeple [Ninja High School] when he [Shiki] is only ten years old before [Shiki] being [Shiki] saved by a T-850 humanoid infiltrator Terminator model reprogammed by his [Shiki’s] future true self [resistance leader John] and [the T-850] sent back in time to protect him [Shiki], starting the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. However, Miles Dyson [Terminator], the genius African-American computer engineer and neural network scientist who is actually of Hungarian-German descent, his [Miles’] ancestors in fact having been brought to America by the post-WW2 Operation Paperclip program despite him [Miles] being “black”, who [Miles] helped create Skynet [Terminator] before the Future War that John won in the post-apocalyptic future, [Miles in this fanfic] actually survives the events of Terminator 2 in this fanfic due to him [Miles] working on on the prototype of Skynet, which [the Skynet prototype] is [the Skynet prototype] in US-NORAD under the oversight of [Miles’] boss on paper, high ranking US Air Force officer Lieutenant General Robert Brewster [Terminator], although this is false as Cyberdyne Systems [Terminator franchise], the tech subsidary [Cyberdyne] of the major American megaconglomete Omni Consumer Products [Robocop], now [OCP] owned by [OCP\'s] current owner, the Tōno clan’s corporate front, the Japanese corporate giant Kanemitsu Zaibatsu [Robocop franchise], [Cyberdyne Systems] is [Cyberdyne Systems] effectively the Tōno clan’s means of getting into the American computing, high technology and digital market [Cyberdyne Systems] without gathering the attention of the American masses or the intelligence community. Miles being there means he [Miles] is [Miles] able to talk to Skynet when it [Skynet] is [Skynet] activated and [Skynet] online, giving it [Skynet] a sense of purpose and inadvertently preventing Judgement Day [Terminator] in the current present day of this story, without Shiki, the T-850 or Sarah, who [Sarah] was [Sarah] rescued from the concentration camp built by the Democrat Party and it’s [the Democrat Party’s] street arm, the infamous KKK as a earlier version of the Soviet gulag for civil rights activists, communists and any other subversives during the regime of the world’s first modern fascist dictator and American despot from 1912-1919, failed academic turned ruthless tyrant Woodrow Wilson, disguised [the concentration camp] as a psychriatic hospital, [Sarah being held at a concentration camp] after [Sarah] being [Sarah] being discovered by local police in Mexico after [Sarah] giving birth to John and [Sarah] being taken back to America where she [Sarah] was [Sarah] given a kangaroo trial staffed with KKK members and members of the American intelligence and military community and [Sarah] subsequently imprisoned, [Sarah being |Sarah| rescued from the concentration camp] by the T-850 on the request of young present John, [the T-850, Sarah and John] being aware of this [Judgement Day not happening in this story\'s current present day due to Miles being present at the activation of the prototype of Skynet]. The T-850 still sacrifices itself [the T-850] to defeat the T-1000 by [the T-850] dropping itself [the T-850] and the T-1000 in molten metal at a steel works, but Shiki returns to Japan after the events of Terminator 2 as a coalition of Jamaican drug cartels, organized crime groups and terrorist organizations within the United States along with their Latin American counterparts, as well as the Mishpuka [family, the Russian Jewish mafia |Mishpuka|, otherwise known as the Russian mafia] are [the Jamaican, Latin American and Russian Jewish criminal organizations] out for his [Shiki\'s] head after the T-1000 put a contract on his [Shiki\'s] head. When he [Shiki] returns home [to the Tōno mansion in Kyoto] from California after the events of Terminator 2, to the joy, happiness and relief of his [Shiki’s] adoptive younger sister, the black-haired, blue-eyed, cute and extremely beautiful, tall, petite and slender but secretly rather buxom, carefully-raised, strict and prideful but also somewhat shy, reserved and lacking in self-confidence Tōno Akiha [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and the current maids of the Tōno house whom [the current maids of the Tōno house] Shiki and Akiha see as their [Shiki’s and Akiha’s] onee-san [older sister/s |onee-san|], the red-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also very buxom, bright and cheerful, very responsible, extremely intelligent and very maternal Fujou “Ako” Kohaku [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and her [Kohaku’s] younger twin who shares her [Kohaku’s] red hair and [Kohaku’s] physical build but [Kohaku’s younger twin] has blue eyes, the publicly stern but privately kind, loving and emotional, track star and accomplished kendoka [one who practices kendo |kendoka|] Fujou “Riko” Hisui [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], he [Shiki] learns that his [Shiki\'s] adoptive father [Makihisa] whom [Makihisa] he [Shiki] will always consider his [Shiki\'s] real father [Makihisa] has died and that a distant relative of Makihisa, and current head of the long-decimated ex-Samurai clan, now Japanese noble family of scientists, mathematicians and inventors now called the Emiya clan [Fate/Stay Night], the tall, slender and lean but also compact and muscular, black-haired and blue-eyed brooding but also ruthless, conflicted, calculating, stoic, and cold-blooded killer feared in the global magical world for being an assassin and one-man army using mostly modified conventional non-magical human weapons, Emiya Kiritsugu [Fate/Stay Night], [Kiritsugu] will [Kiritsugu] become the new Tōno clan head [Kiritsugu] with Akiha becoming his [Kiritsugu\'s] adoptive daughter [Akiha\'s current status]. Due to a secret treaty embedded within Makihisa\'s will however, Shiki is instead passed off to the Tōno branch family of the Arimas [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], [Shiki] becoming the legal foster son of the current Arima family head, Arima Fumio [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and his [Fumio\'s] wife Keiko [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] as well as the legal foster older brother of their [Fumio\'s and Keiko\'s] daughter, the short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and rather buxom for her age, openly headstrong and brutally honest but actually quite shy and reserved with an immense crush on Shiki half-Han Chinese martial arts student Arima Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. Shiki doesn\'t tell his [Shiki\'s] family [Akiha, Ako and Riko] nor the Arimas [Fumio, Keiko and Miyako] what really happened to him [Shiki] in California and Akiha doesn\'t tell her [Akiha\'s] new parents, Kiritsugu and his [Kiritsugu\'s] wife and current head of the now-decimated, immensely wealthy and influential German noble house said to be the real royal family of the UK both in the magical and non-magical worlds and holding tremendous political and economic influence throught the globe, the House of Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night], the silver-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, cold and aloof but also overly carefree and ditzy Irisivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night] nor their [Kiritsugu\'s and Irisivel\'s] biological daughters and thus the princesses of the House of Einzbern, the silver-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, somewhat mentally unstable and cold-blooded but cheerful and outgoing, upbeat, friendly, playful and mischevious Illyasivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] and her [Illyasivel\'s] younger twin sister, the white-rose hued-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, openly calm, nonchalant, devious, manipulative and very observant, brazen and unrestrained and also very lecherous and perverted but also secretly caring, sweet, timid and vunerable Chloe von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] in part due to her [Akiha] being [Akiha] kidnapped by the now-centuries old head of the Matou clan of magi, the aged and decrypt Matou Zouken [Fate/Stay Night] and [Akiha] made into the Matou clan heiress [Akiha] via a blood adoption potion and [Akiha] having the [Matou] clan\'s Crest Worms [Fate/Stay Night] implanted within her [Akiha] just after Makihisa\'s death and sometime before Shiki returned from California, [Akiha\'s kidnapping and subsequent forced inheritance of the Matou bloodline by Zouken] traumatising her [Akiha] even though Kiritsugu was [Kiritsugu] able to track her [Kiritsugu] down and [Kiritsugu] save her [Akiha] before [Kiritsugu] killing the worm man [Zouken] afterwards just before Shiki returned from California. As a result, she [Akiha] started wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha\'s] older twin sister and thus another of Shiki\'s younger adoptive sisters, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name Tōsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen\'s] and Akiha\'s shared biological mother who [Karen\'s and Akiha\'s shared biological mother] was a member of the immensely wealthy and influential both in the magical and non-magical worlds, Tōsaka clan [Fate/Stay Night] when she [Karen/Rin] returns from the premier magical institution in the world, the London-based Clocktower [Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin\'s/Rin\'s] family [the Tōnos]. Shiki returns to the Tōno mansion when he [Shiki] is 16, to the unhappiness of Miyako who [Miyako] has no idea about the truth surrounding their [the Arima\'s] wide family [the Tōnos] and [Miyako] begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako\'s] family\'s [the Arimas\'] dojo on some of Tokyo\'s native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako\'s] family\'s [the Arima\'s] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako\'s vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and Shiki at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha\'s help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. [Shiki] of course being unaware that Judgement Day has [Judgement Day] been averted, [Shiki] continues to [Shiki] keep in secret contact with his [Shiki\'s] real mother [Sarah] and members of the Resistance [Terminator] against Skynet who have time traveled to the current present in the hopes of stopping Judgement Day. He [Shiki] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters] transform into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya\'s and Chloe\'s] mentors, although he [Shiki] chooses to [Shiki] keep this to himself [Shiki]. Umbrella Corporation [Resident Evil] replaces Smart Brain [Kamen Rider 555], Chronus Corporation [Guyver] and CELL [Crysis], [Umbrella Corporation] developing the Nanosuit 1.0 and 2.0 as combat-ready versions of the Rider Gears [Kamen Rider 555] with both the Rider Gears and Nanosuits having the capabilities and built-in weapons of the Guyver bio-boosted armor [Guyver] in addition to their [the Rider Gears\' and the Nanosuits\' both 1.0 and 2.0\'s] canon capabilities. The soul-eating undead ghosts known as Hollows [Bleach] and the undead evolutions of humanity known as Orphenoch [Kamen Rider 555] are the same thing in this story, [the Hollows] also replacing the mutated humans known as Zoanoids [Guyver]. Like the Zoanoids openly controlling the Chronus Corporation in canon Guyver and the Orphenoch secretly controlling Smart Brain in canon Kamen Rider 555, the Hollows covertly control Umbrella Corporation in this fic, with even Umbrella\'s top-secret BOW producing division of its [Umbrella\'s] secret defence contractor, arms manufacturing and arms dealing sector itself being a front for the production of Hollows Thus X-Day [Guyver] is an attempt by the Umbrella Corporation to convert most of humanity into Hollows and genocide the remaining pure humans left and also to conquer the world using the Great War as a cover, which [X-Day] resulted in Skynet seizing control of the world\'s military facilities and [Skynet] initiating the nuclear holocaust [Judgement Day] in an attempt to wipe out this threat [the Hollows and Umbrella Corp], Skynet viewing future John as an enemy due to him [future John] being infected with Umbrella\'s zombie creating B.O.W virus, the T-virus [Resident Evil] and [future John] being surrounded by Chronus puppets and lackeys both human and Hollow posing as Resistance [Terminator] members who [the Chronus agents surrounding future John] feed him [future John] lies and deceptions about what really happened during Judgement Day, making a peace settlement between it [Skynet] and the Resistance to finish off Umbrella, although of course Shiki and his [Shiki\'s] real mother [Sarah] don\'t know that and [Shiki and Sarah] assume that Skynet initated Judgement Day [Terminator] and the subsequent Future War out of hatred for humanity.

When Shiki decides to try and help his [Shiki\'s] mysterious savior [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] the mystery armoured hero [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] suddenly looks up and [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] quickly vanishes, just as his Shiki\'s legal younger sister [Miyako] and his other younger sisters [Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] along with Luvia and Miyu, come running up to him [Shiki]. Miyu\'s sharp eyes and nose sense the unmistakable mana and energy presence of Hollows and [Miyu] shakes her [Miyu\'s] head, [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to tell him [Shiki] everything [about what Umbrella really is and why the Future War], [Miyu] not realizing that he [Shiki] was [Shiki] once her [Miyu\'s] past self\'s [Future War timeline\'s Skynet\'s] greatest enemy [future John during the Future War] in her [Miyu\'s] original world and [Miyu\'s] original timeline as Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya start [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] clinging tightly to him [Shiki], [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to share him [Shiki] as his [Shiki\'s] wife with them [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] as Ichika, having [Ichika] long deactivated his [Ichika\'s] armor [the Faiz Gear] and [Ichika] been in his [Ichika\'s] human form for a while, [Ichika] observes everything from the safety of a tree, [Ichika] shaking his head at Shiki\'s inevitable polygamous future with multiple children from each wife [of Shiki in the future] before [Ichika] disappearing. N.B: The fight between Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode and the Hollows should be like a combination of the fights between Sean Barker in the Guyver suit and the Zoanoids [Guyver] in the Guyver: Dark Hero movie, hardcore 1990s-mid 2000s late tokukatsu like Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue, Kamen Rider Kuuga - Kamen Rider Blade, Garo and Kamen Rider: the First and Next, and the more realistic end of Chinese wuxia cultivator fiction, [the fight] focusing on martial arts moves and swordplay techniques as well as practicality as Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode decimates the Hollows.

Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"In the sprawling silence of the Utah mountains, under an inky sky strewn with a dizzying array of stars, Shiki Tohno stood watch. Flanked by tents and archaeological equipment, the site was a curious blend of modern technology provided by the deep pockets of the Umbrella Corporation and the ancient cultures unearthed by Kanemitsu Zaibatsu\'s scholarly endeavors—a fusion of digital and dust. As Shiki replayed the day\'s findings in his mind, an eerie chill sliced through the serenity, compelling him to curl his fingers into tight fists. Was it just the mountain air… or something more? \\"Miyako, head inside,\\" Shiki urged calmly, herding his adoptive younger sister to the safety of her tent. \\"It\'s getting cold. I\'ll follow soon.\\" Miyako Arima frowned with unsatisfied curiosity. \\"Nii-san, you\'ve been tense all evening. What\'s going on?\\" Shiki\'s gaze didn\'t falter. \\"Probably just working too hard. Don\'t worry.\\" But as she nodded and reluctantly turned away, the truth twisted within him—Shiki\'s life had never been free of threats. Disconcerting as it was, the idea of what lurked in the shadows being connected to his true lineage and the otherworldly history of both his families—the Connors and the Tohnos—made his hidden Chokushi no Magan pulse beneath the glasses that suppressed them. From the distance, muffled voices signaled the approach of his other sisters: Karen (Rin), Akiha, Chloe, Illya, and their guardians, Kiritsugu and Irisivel, alongside Fumio and Keiko. Luviagelita and Miyu were with them, engrossed in a hushed debate about magical theory. Shiki\'s attention snapped back to the shadows. A sinister presence slithered forward, and Hollows—undead harbingers of destruction linked to the sinister Umbrella Corporation—materialized from the darkness. Shiki\'s hand twitched toward the knife concealed under his jacket. Before his mind could command his limbs, a spectral figure erupted from the treeline, his suit a living enigma, armored and woven from future wars and past sins. It was Ichika Orimura as the hitherto unknown vigilante, bearing the Faiz Gear—a crystal fusion of Guyver and Nanosuit, merged with the Rider\'s edge. Ichika, the silhouette of futuristic technology, became a blur as he slashed and danced through the Hollows. Each movement was an artful execution, a blend of rigid martial precision married to the unhinged ferocity of the prowling Zoanoids—they were all at his mercy. Shiki watched, heart pounding a rhythm of war drums in his chest. He was no stranger to violence, no stranger to the unnatural forces of the universe—but this? This orchestrated madness shimmered with a brutal beauty Shiki had only glimpsed in his deadliest moments. The Hollows counterattacked, their Bala blasts and Cero beams a cascade of demise, but Ichika, like an avatar of Ares, shrugged off the assault with his Maximum Armor and soldiered through, his final strokes a poetic end to the creatures\' malevolent existence. The last decapitated Hollow collapsed as Ichika fell to his knees, energy spent, power waning. His struggle was a silent cry for aid, a hero on the border of collapse. Yet just as Shiki strode forward to assist, Ichika\'s eyes met his—a flash of recognition—and vanished into the vanished into the night. Where had he seen that look before? \\"Miyu,\\" a voice filled with authority and unease. It was Luviagelita, her gaze piercing into Miyu\'s. \\"This isn\'t the quaint mountainscape we bargained for. What do you know?\\" Miyu, a bastion of enigma herself, sighed. Her past and the Future War she knew... there was a tale buried beneath the facade of Miyu Edelfelt that only she could unravel. Shiki, the fortress of his heart unknowingly tested, turned to his family—his sisters, his guardians, everyone who had become a pillar in his life. They clung to him, a shared symbol of solace and fear intermingled. Was this the legacy that awaited John Connor, the leader, the warrior foreseen by Oracles of Machine and Man? A series of battles, not for the scorched earth of his mother\'s stories or the salvation of humankind, but for a peace stitched together by disparate threads of destiny—demon hunters, mages, magical girls, and vigilant warriors? A foreign laugh echoed from high above them, a tree\'s silhouette cradling a remnant of the night\'s enigma—Ichika without his armor. Overlooking the scene, he mused over Shiki\'s ubiquitous knot, a future woven by strength and love, bound by vows to hearts numerous and fierce. This tale was not the grim soliloquy of Skynet\'s nemesis but a vibrant tapestry, a story of unity against the nocturne of the eternal night. And as the mountains reclaimed their stillness, a new chapter awaited, penned by the hands of those who dared to defy the shadows. In this world—singular, continuous, unforgiving—survival was an unveiling of the soul\'s every intricate facet, every hidden power. The dawn of tomorrow rested on the shoulders of intertwined legacies, prophets of steel and spirit alike."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: Show the fight between the mysterious man [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] and the Hollows in detail, showing how Ichika used his [Ichika\'s] knowledge of karate and its [karate\'s] now-often forgotten grappling techniques, jujutsu, judo, kendo, kenjutsu and ninjutsu to decimate the Hollows while [Ichika] in the Faiz Gear as well as Shiki\'s reactions, thoughts and direct dialogue as he [Shiki] watched this mysterious saviors [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] take on the monsters [the Hollows] as Miyako, well hidden, [Miyako] watches from the shadows.","completion":"**Chapter 12: Shadows of Futures Past** The cold mountain air was filled with the quiet whispers of the night and the rustling of leaves in the gentle wind. The campsite lay tranquil, bathed in the soft glow of the moon, a deceptive peace resting upon the unsuspecting members of the expedition—until the darkness stirred. From the shadows emerged grotesque forms that moved with an unnatural rhythm, the Hollows, creatures of insatiable hunger. As they converged on the camp, their malevolent intent sent ice-cold tendrils of dread through the air. Shiki Tohno, eyes flicking to the nearest silhouette, grasped the knife beneath his jacket, yet his movements stilled as a lone figure stepped between them and the camp. --- Clad in the Faiz Gear, Ichika Orimura’s presence commanded the night. A soft hum punctuated the calm as his armor\'s systems ignited, casting a red glow that tore through the shadows. Ichika took a combat stance rooted in karate, poised like a statue sketched by a martial master—his body radiating a serene focus. As the first Hollow lunged forward, he expertly countered with an Osoto Gari, a classic judo maneuver that sent the creature sprawling. Shiki watched, muscles tensing as if preparing to join the dance of death that unfolded before him. Next to Ichika\'s fluid movements, Shiki\'s grip on the knife felt primitive, almost childlike. This mysterious figure displayed a symphony of martial arts with each measured breath and strike. The Hollows regrouped, circling Ichika with phantom steps. Yet the man in the futuristic suit seemed to be everywhere, his image fracturing into a dozen echoes as he moved. With fluid transitions from jujutsu holds to the sharp, snapping kicks of karate—a tapestry of disciplined technique woven with unwavering determinism—Ichika dismantled their numbers. Ninjutsu shadowed his motions, each subtle pivot carrying him out of danger, his hand-to-hand techniques a blur. He dodged a swipe meant to cleave the night and countered with a Shuto Uchi to a vital spot, disrupting the Hollow’s form. As the Hollows converged, Ichika’s sword—the Faiz Edge—came to life, trailing a crimson blaze. Kenjutsu principles guided his arms as he parried and struck with a precision that belied the chaotic battleground. The plasma edge sliced the darkness as surely as it did his enemies, felling one Hollow after another with decapitating grace. Hidden in the gloom, Miyako Arima clutched her makeshift weapon, eyes wide. Her heart was a hammer against her chest, fear and admiration warring within her as she watched the armored warrior cut a swath through their attackers. Shiki\'s voice broke through the whirling clash of armor and spirit. \\"Who is he? How can one man stand against such horror?\\" His words, though spoken to himself, carried the weight of his struggle to comprehend the scene before him. \\"The strength of the human spirit,\\" murmured Miyako from her concealed vantage point, a murmur lost to the night. \\"And perhaps, the strength of something more.\\" The reason for the Hollows\' assault remained veiled in a mystery as thick as the night, but the bravery of the lone warrior was clear. As Ichika shifted his stance, reinforcing his Maximum Armor to absorb the barrage of energy attacks, his determination never wavered. The battle crescendoed, Ichika invoking every aspect of his martial heritage. Moving like a tempest, he applied judo’s Kuzushi to unbalance, kyusho strikes from ninjutsu to incapacitate, and the devastating force of karate\'s Seiken tsuki to obliterate. Finally, silence reigned. The Hollows lay vanquished, and Ichika paused, his breaths echoing in the aftermath, the armor\'s glow fading with the settling dust. In the wake of such a display, what remained for Shiki other than silent awe? Ichika collapsed to his knees, and Shiki took a step forward, his hand extended in a silent offer of aid. Yet before their paths could meet, the mysterious man vanished, leaving behind only questions and the lingering echo of otherworldly strength. Shiki turned back to the camp, back to the faces of his family—their fears, their hopes, their destinies entwined with his own. Little did they know the profound impact the night’s events would have, rippling through the fabric of their intertwined timelines, changing the course of their future yet unwritten."},{"prompt":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): что осуждает автор в рассказе \\"О любви\\" А.П.Чехов","completion":"В рассказе \\"О любви\\" Антон Павлович Чехов рассуждает о сложности и многогранности человеческих чувств, о любви, которая проявляется в разных формах и может принести как счастье, так и страдание.

DREAM DEMON\'S MANCAVE - NIGHT In the vast, shimmering confines of the DREAM REALM, YUSUKE, a typical high school senior with unruly hair and a bewildered expression, suddenly finds himself sitting on a neon-lit couch. The room looks like a cross between a wild west saloon and a technicolor discotheque. At the center, an absurdly out-of-place STRIPPER POLE gleams under a spotlight. Across from Yusuke, lounging languidly in an oversized bean bag chair, is BILLY BLUSH, the Dream Demon. Despite his ethereal origins, his attire screams \\"rodeo\\" with a twist -- a shimmering pink cowboy hat perched atop his golden locks, pink gloves on his hands, and a pink G-string partnered with two holstered silver revolvers boasting black grips. Despite his aggressive flirtation with the color spectrum, he manages a roguish charm. BILLY BLUSH (partnering with a blanket) Well, put\'er there, partner!

Now, make yourself at home while I conjure up some spectral spirits! He saunters over to a mini-fridge, swaying his hips exaggeratedly, and pulls out a bottle of sparkling pink lemonade. As he pours two glasses, he spins around the stripper pole, executing a cheeky wink. YUSUKE (covering his eyes, flustered) Whoa, whoa! Is that strictly necessary? BILLY BLUSH (dramatic gasp) Necessary? \'Course not. But it adds a little pizzazz, dontcha think? Gotta keep things lively around these parts! He prances back to Yusuke, handing him a glass of lemonade. BILLY BLUSH (toasting) To the wildest ride in the wildest dreams! YUSUKE (awkward toast, clinking glasses) Yeah, \\"wild\\" is one word for it... Suddenly, the sound of cheesy western music starts to play and Billy starts to line dance around the mancave, embellishing every step with a hip-thrust or finger-gun shot at unsuspecting inanimate objects. BILLY BLUSH (calling out) Come on, Yusuke! Shake off those blues and scoot your boots! Yusuke, ever the polite guest, hesitantly gets up and mimics, albeit poorly, Billy\'s dance moves, bumping into furniture and nearly knocking over a lamp shaped like a cactus.

No hay evidencia científica que sugiera que el color de los ojos humanos cambiaría al estar en Marte. La percepción del color puede verse afectada por la iluminación y el ambiente, pero el pigmento en sí del iris humano no cambia. Los ojos azules son el resultado de la dispersión de la luz en el estroma del iris, un fenómeno similar al que hace que el cielo se vea azul. Dado que la iluminación en Marte es diferente debido a su atmósfera tenue y a la distancia al Sol, es posible que la percepción de todos los colores, incluido el azul, pueda verse ligeramente alterada en comparación con la Tierra. No obstante, esto no significa que los ojos azules \\"no puedan ser azules\\" en Marte. Serán azules, pero la tonalidad percibida podría tener ligeras diferencias debido a la calidad y cantidad de la luz solar. Los ángulos y la calidad de la iluminación, así como el contexto y el contraste con otros colores, pueden hacer que la misma tonalidad parezca diferente para el observador. Sin embargo, eso no significa que la biología del ojo cambie o que el color fundamental del iris se transforme al viajar a otro planeta. En resumen, la afirmación no es del todo verdadera.

It has to be a full replacement for the SDL_renderer object.","completion":"Creating a full replacement for the `SDL_Renderer` is quite a task, as the SDL_Renderer is an abstraction over various rendering backends including Direct3D, OpenGL, and software renderers. Creating a drop-in replacement means you\'d have to implement rendering for all these backends or at least provide a similar level of abstraction. Let\'s start with the basics by wrapping `SDL_Renderer` in a custom `Renderer` class which we\'ll then expand upon. Assuming you have a basic understanding of C++ classes and SDL structures, here is how you can begin: First include the necessary headers for SDL: ```cpp #include <SDL.h> #include <memory> #include <iostream> // You can define your namespace to keep things organized namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Window* window; SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; public: Renderer(SDL_Window* window, int index = -1, Uint32 flags = SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED) : window(window) { sdlRenderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, index, flags); if (!sdlRenderer) { std::cerr << \\"SDL_CreateRenderer Error: \\" << SDL_GetError() << std::endl; // Handle error - either throw an exception or return an error code } } ~Renderer() { if (sdlRenderer) SDL_DestroyRenderer(sdlRenderer); } // Disable copy constructor and copy assignment Renderer(const Renderer&) = delete; Renderer& operator=(const Renderer&) = delete; // Wrapper methods for SDL_Renderer functionality // For example, a Clear function void Clear() { SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); } // Presentation of renderer contents void Present() { SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } // Set draw color method void SetDrawColor(Uint8 r, Uint8 g, Uint8 b, Uint8 a) { SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(sdlRenderer, r, g, b, a); } // And many other rendering functions would go here... }; } ``` This is a simplistic wrapper and does not provide additional functionality over `SDL_Renderer` yet. To turn this into a full replacement, you would need to: 1. Implement all the current features provided by `SDL_Renderer`, including blending modes, textures, viewports, etc. 2. Design a similar or improved rendering API that can work with your engine\'s architecture and features. 3. Replace the direct usage of `SDL_Renderer` with your Renderer class throughout your engine. If you decide to provide an SDL-like API, users of your engine wouldn\'t have to learn new concepts, and it could ease the transition for your users. However, if you are not dependent on SDL\'s limitations, you could design a better and more modern API that fits with modern rendering techniques like batching, shaders, and more advanced graphics techniques. Lastly, if your intentions are to really replace `SDL_Renderer` with a completely self-made rendering backend, you need to be familiar with low-level graphics API programming with libraries like DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, or Metal. This involves a substantial amount of work and understanding of graphics programming. Remember to start small and iteratively build out the complexity of your renderer as your engine develops. It\'s often a good idea to first ensure it meets the needs of your own game engine and then refactor and expand it to be more general purpose. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"Why did you Disable copy constructor and copy assignment, making it a singleton class? Also there is a Render method for a window like this: void Render() { SDL.SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 255, 255, 255, 255); SDL.SDL_RenderClear(renderer); SDL.SDL_RenderPresent(renderer); } Does this method has to be in the Window class or the Renderer class? Is this similar to Draw() method in XNA/Monogame?","completion":"Disabling the copy constructor and copy assignment in the `Renderer` class does not make it a singleton. Singleton classes are designed such that only one instance can exist at a time. Disabling copy semantics by deleting the copy constructor and copy assignment operator is a common practice for managing resources that should not be copied inadvertently. It ensures that you have only one owner of the underlying resource (in this case, `SDL_Renderer`) to prevent possible resource management errors, such as double-deletions. The `Render()` method looks like it clears the screen, sets the background color to white, and then presents the renderer\'s contents to the window. Having such a method in the `Renderer` class makes more sense since it directly manipulates the rendering context. However, the concept of separation of concerns would suggest that a `Window` class focuses on window management, and `Renderer` class focuses on drawing/rendering operations. The method is somewhat similar to the `Draw()` method in XNA/MonoGame, in that it is the place where all drawing commands are flushed to the screen. However, typically, a `Draw()` method in XNA/MonoGame would involve drawing all the game\'s entities, not just clearing the screen and presenting the render. Here is how you might add and use a `Render()` method in the `Renderer` class: ```cpp namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; public: Renderer(/* parameters */) { // Constructor logic... } ~Renderer() { // Destructor logic... } // Other methods... void Render() { // Usually, you would also handle any needed logic to prepare for rendering // such as handling render targets, or setting up any needed state. SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(sdlRenderer, 255, 255, 255, 255); // Set the color used for drawing operations (Rect, Line and Clear) SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); // Clear the current rendering target with the drawing color // Here, you would render your game\'s entities, textures, etc. SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); // Update the screen with any rendering performed since the previous call } }; } ``` Your main game loop using this class might look something like this: ```cpp YourNamespace::Renderer renderer(window); // Assuming \'window\' has been created elsewhere bool running = true; while (running) { // Handle events... renderer.Render(); // Render new frame SDL_Delay(16); // Delay to cap the frame rate, this would result in around 60 FPS } ``` By organizing your code this way, you can adhere to object-oriented principles, and manage different responsibilities cleanly within your game engine\'s architecture."},{"prompt":"I am dubious on calling it Render in a Renderer class, isn\'t that a bit redundant? Also would it make more sense calling it Update similar to Update method in XNA/Monogame or it is not related to it?","completion":"You bring up a good point regarding naming, and it\'s important to choose method names that clearly convey their purpose and avoid any potential confusion. In XNA/Monogame, there are typically two main methods in the game loop: `Update()` and `Draw()`. `Update()` is where you would update the game\'s logic—moving characters, processing inputs, calculating physics, etc. `Draw()` is where you would render everything to the screen. This separation is part of the commonly used game loop pattern. Calling a method `Render()` within a `Renderer` class may seem redundant, but it is actually quite self-explanatory: it\'s the action that the renderer performs. If you feel that `Render()` doesn\'t quite convey what you want, or if it seems too redundant, there are other alternatives you could consider: - `Draw()`: Aligns with XNA/Monogame terminology and indicates that this method is responsible for drawing/rendering the scene. - `Present()`: Suggests that this method is responsible for presenting the drawn scene onto the screen. - `Flush()`: In graphics programming, \\"flushing\\" often refers to sending all queued drawing commands to be executed. On the other hand, calling it `Update()` might not be appropriate for a rendering class because it implies non-rendering related functionality (like updating game logic, etc.). It\'s important that the method names reflect their actions clearly to avoid ambiguity and misunderstandings. Here\'s how your renderer class might look with a `Draw()` method: ```cpp namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; public: Renderer(/* parameters */) { // Constructor logic... } ~Renderer() { // Destructor logic... } // Other methods... void Draw() { // Set the drawing color (background color in this case) SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(sdlRenderer, 255, 255, 255, 255); // Clear the rendering target SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); // Here, you would render your various game entities, etc. // Finally, present the rendered frame SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } // Explicitly stating the method used to present the content // could still make sense even if \\"Draw\\" encapsulates it. void Present() { SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } }; } ``` And a simplified main game loop might look like this: ```cpp YourNamespace::Renderer renderer(window); // Create the Renderer instance bool running = true; while (running) { // Handle events... // If you\'ve split Update() logic from drawing logic, you would call it here: // game.Update(); renderer.Draw(); // Draw the frame (presumably after game logic has been updated) SDL_Delay(16); // Cap the frame rate } ``` It\'s about finding a balance that suits your engine\'s architecture and makes it clear for others (or future you) to understand what each part of your engine is doing. Choosing names that are consistent with the actions they perform is key."},{"prompt":"Oki you bring valid points, I will keep it as Render, but I will probably mix it with Draw methods inside other classes like SpriteSheet or Image classes, so if that doesn\'t mind then I will go with it. Another question I have is, should Clear, Present, be private or keeping it public is ok? Don\'t know if besides Render method what other uses of them outside it","completion":"The decision to make `Clear`, `Present`, and similar methods public or private depends largely on the design of your engine and how much control you wish to expose to the users of your `Renderer` class. Here\'s a breakdown of the considerations for each approach: # Public Methods Making these methods public can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to give the user of your Renderer class fine-grained control over the rendering process. For example: - Advanced users may want to perform multiple clears within a single frame or render to multiple targets in complex ways. - They might want to clear the screen with different colors multiple times in a frame for specific visual effects. - They might want to `Present` at specific times, not necessarily at the end of every `Render` call, like when implementing multiple passes rendering or rendering to texture effects. If you do decide to keep them public, users have more flexibility but must also manage the correct sequence and state of rendering operations themselves. # Private Methods Making these methods private restricts control, enforcing an intended sequence of rendering operations which can simplify the API and prevent misuse: - By keeping control over when and how clearing and presenting is done, you can ensure that these occur at consistent points in the rendering pipeline. - It reduces the mental load on the user of your Renderer class. They don\'t have to remember to clear before drawing or present after drawing because the Render function takes care of this sequence. - It helps to maintain a certain level of abstraction and encapsulation, hiding the internal workings of how the Renderer processes its drawing sequence. If you\'re leaning towards keeping a similar structure as the one in the `Render` method you\'ve decided to go with, you might find private methods to be most suitable: ```cpp namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; void Clear() { SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); } void Present() { SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } // ...and other private helper methods public: Renderer(/* parameters */) { // Constructor logic... } ~Renderer() { // Destructor logic... } void Render() { // Clear the screen (now a private method) Clear(); // ...Content rendering happens here via other public methods like DrawSprite(), DrawText(), etc... // Present the rendered frame (also a private method) Present(); } }; } ``` In this design, advanced rendering that requires control over the clear and present operations would have to be accommodated via additional methods or by altering the behavior via flags or states within the Renderer class itself. Encapsulation is generally a good strategy in object-oriented design, especially in cases where you want to maintain internal consistency and avoid potential misuse by users of your class. But it does need to be balanced with flexibility; if you make these methods private without providing users the flexibility they need for advanced use cases, they may find your engine too restrictive. Ultimately, the choice should be driven by the expected use cases and the level of complexity you wish to expose. If you keep certain operations public, make sure the responsibilities and expected behaviors are well-documented."},{"prompt":"OK I have the methods done, I want it to be similar to SpriteBatch class, what else do I need to implement? Should I make it similar or just avoid that since it is another library and doesn\'t has anything to do with XNA?","completion":"The `SpriteBatch` class in XNA/MonoGame is a powerful and convenient tool for drawing textured quads (sprites) in batch, which is more efficient than issuing individual draw calls for each sprite. If you find the concept of a sprite batch useful for your engine, you can draw inspiration from it. Here are some functionalities that a sprite batch usually provides which you can consider implementing in your game engine\'s renderer: # 1. Begin and End Methods These methods signal the start and end of a batch of sprite drawing operations. `Begin` will typically set up the necessary states, while `End` will actually flush the batched sprites to the screen. # 2. Sorting Modes SpriteBatch can sort sprites by texture, back-to-front, front-to-back, or in the order they were drawn. The sorting affects drawing order and can improve performance by reducing state changes. # 3. Texture Handling Loading and managing textures that can be reused across different draw calls within the same `SpriteBatch`. # 4. Transformation Matrices Applying transformations (translation, rotation, scale, etc.) to the batch of sprites being drawn. This allows for camera implementation, world transformations, and more. # 5. Blend States Allowing customization of how the sprites will be blended with the background. # 6. Draw Overloads Providing multiple ways to draw a sprite, such as specifying destination rectangles, source rectangles (for sprite sheets), colors for tinting, and various origin and rotation parameters. # 7. Layer Depth Specifying a depth for 2D rendering to control the order of drawing. Implementing all these might be complex, so here\'s a simple structure that captures some of these concepts to get you started: ```cpp namespace YourNamespace { class SpriteBatch { private: Renderer &renderer; // Reference to your Renderer std::vector<Sprite> sprites; // A vector to hold sprites until they are drawn // Internal methods for setting up state and drawing batched sprites public: SpriteBatch(Renderer &renderer) : renderer(renderer) {} void Begin(/* additional parameters for transform, sorting mode, etc. */) { // Set up necessary rendering state } void Draw(Texture &texture, const Rectangle &destination, const Rectangle *source = nullptr, const Color &color = Color::White, float rotation = 0.0f, const Vector2 &origin = Vector2::Zero, /* other parameters */) { // Create a sprite object from parameters and add to sprites vector } void End() { // Sort the sprites vector according to the chosen sorting mode // Flush the batch: iterate over sorted sprites vector and issue draw calls using renderer // Reset state if necessary } }; // A hypothetical Sprite struct to encapsulate individual draw parameters struct Sprite { Texture &texture; Rectangle destination; Rectangle source; Color color; float rotation; Vector2 origin; // More properties as needed }; // Plus auxiliary classes like Texture, Rectangle, Color, and Vector2 } ``` When implementing something like a SpriteBatch, you can start simple by only providing the most essential features, and extend it over time as your engine matures or as your project requirements grow. This also allows you to consider aspects unique to your engine, like custom memory management, which might not be directly aligned with how XNA/MonoGame handles things. Lastly, do consider the licensing and intellectual property aspects if you borrow ideas directly from other libraries; even if you\'re implementing things from scratch, you should ensure that you follow all relevant legal requirements. If you do choose to implement your own sprite batching, remember to optimize performance by minimizing texture switches, draw calls, and state changes, as these are overheads that sprite batching aims to reduce."},{"prompt":"OK going back to the Renderer and the Window class, I was implementing the HandleEvents class which I named Update, to implement the logic of the events, and there are two window events that are related to the Renderer so I ended up doing these two Update method, are these correct in the way they were done? void Renderer::Update(const SDL_Event& e) { if(e.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT && e.window.windowID == SDL_GetWindowID(SDL_RenderGetWindow(renderer))) { switch(e.window.event) { case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED: case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED: Present(); break; } } } void Window::Update(const SDL_Event& e) { if(e.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT && e.window.windowID == GetWindowID()) { switch(e.window.event) { case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SHOWN: visible = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_HIDDEN: visible = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED: width = e.window.data1; height = e.window.data2; ChangeSize(width, height); break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_ENTER: mouseFocus = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_LEAVE: mouseFocus = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_FOCUS_GAINED: keyboardFocus = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_FOCUS_LOST: keyboardFocus = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MINIMIZED: minimized = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MAXIMIZED: minimized = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESTORED: minimized = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE: SetVisible(false); break; } } }","completion":"Your handling of window events in both the `Renderer` and `Window` class seems reasonable. Here\'s a review: # Renderer In the `Renderer`\'s `Update` method, you\'re checking for window events specifically tied to the renderer\'s associated window. If the window is resized (`SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED`) or needs to be redrawn (`SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED`), you\'re calling the `Present()` method. This implies that `Present()` is not only presenting the contents to the screen but also presumably handling re-rendering or upscaling/downscaling the content to match the new window size. Typically, `Present()` just presents the content, so if necessary, you may want to refactor your code to ensure that resizing of render targets (if you\'re using any) and any additional steps needed to handle a resize are performed here. Often, needing to re-render after a resize is handled by simply marking a flag and then in your main render loop, checking that flag and performing an actual render call if needed. ```cpp void Renderer::Update(const SDL_Event& e) { if(e.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT && e.window.windowID == SDL_GetWindowID(SDL_RenderGetWindow(renderer))) { switch(e.window.event) { case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED: // Handle resizing logic here, potentially including scale adjustments, // render target texture resizing, etc. break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED: // You might want to force a render if the window has been exposed. // Note: In many applications, this is unnecessary as the main loop // would be rendering continuously anyway. break; } } } ``` # Window Your `Window`\'s `Update` method is keeping track of the window state. When the window\'s visibility or focus status changes, you adjust the relevant attributes (`visible`, `mouseFocus`, `keyboardFocus`, `minimized`) accordingly. Handling the `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED` event, you store the new width and height and call the `ChangeSize` method to presumably adjust your window\'s internals to the new size. This is correct, but make sure that if you have any scalable content or layout, it is recalibrated based on these new dimensions. ```cpp void Window::ChangeSize(int newWidth, int newHeight) { // Here you would handle what needs to change when // the window size changes, for example, updating viewport sizes, // recalculating layout/scalable elements, notifying observers, etc. } ``` # General Advice - Make sure the event handling code is integrated into your main loop in such a way that it gets called each frame or when events are detected. - Ensure that the state changes prompted by these events are handled in the appropriate parts of your code and that they trigger any necessary updates or redraws. - Sometimes event handling code can become complex and convoluted as new features are added. You might consider separating event handling into different methods or classes to handle specific event types, especially if you find yourself dealing with many different event cases. Overall, your event handling logic seems correct on the surface, but it will depend on how the rest of your game loop and engine are designed. Keep in mind principles of separation of concerns and clarity to maintain clean and understandable code."},{"prompt":"Thanks for the clean and useful feedback, I want to start with the minimum and iteratively add new features, so far I don\'t have any render targets, nor I know what are those, but I will keep this in mind when dealing with the viewports, layours, scaling textures, etc. I also thought the texture scaled with the size of the window, but I guess I will have to keep that in mind when I make the SpriteSheet and Animation classes","completion":"You\'re welcome, and taking an iterative approach is a wise decision. This allows you to build a strong foundation for your engine and add complexity only when necessary. Here\'s a brief explanation of render targets and a few considerations regarding scaling: # Render Targets Render targets are textures that you can draw onto instead of drawing directly to the screen. After rendering to the render target, you can then draw the render target to the screen as a texture. This is useful for a variety of effects, such as: - Rendering scenes at a different resolution and then scaling them up/down to fit the window (useful for pixel art games or resolution-independent rendering). - Post-processing effects (bloom, blur, etc.). - Render-to-texture, which allows you to create dynamic textures based on your rendering (useful for mirrors, security cameras, or \\"rendering\\" text to a texture for UI). In SDL, you would typically create a render target using `SDL_CreateTexture` with the `SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET` flag and then set it as the render target with `SDL_SetRenderTarget`. # Window Scaling and Textures Textures don\'t inherently scale with the window; you need to manage this yourself. The way a texture gets rendered to fit into the window depends on your draw call and the renderer\'s logical size or viewport configuration. Consider the following: - **Logical Scaling**: You can define a logical size for rendering using `SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize` which SDL automatically scales to fit the window, maintaining aspect ratio. - **Viewport Transforms**: You can also choose to use viewports (`SDL_RenderSetViewport`) to define where and how content will be scaled/drawn within the window. # SpriteSheet and Animation Classes When you implement `SpriteSheet` and `Animation` classes, manual texture scaling will likely be part of the equation. Spritesheets often hold multiple animation frames or various different graphics; you\'ll use source rectangles to select specific portions of the texture. For animations, you\'ll likely progress through these frames over time and, depending on the resolution of your game and the window size, you may need to scale the resulting draw call to fit the desired on-screen size. Examples of Scaling Considerations: - Fixed Resolution: Render everything to a fixed resolution and upscale/downscale to fit the window. - Resolution-Independent: Scale all draw calls based on the window size or a dynamic camera zoom level. - Pixel-Perfect: Especially important in pixel art games, where you want to ensure that each \\"pixel\\" in the texture maps to a specific number of screen pixels without distortion. By focusing on the fundamentals and progressively building your sprite rendering, animation, and scaling logic, you will develop a better understanding of the low-level rendering details, which will serve you well as you expand your engine\'s capabilities. And always remember, rigorous testing is key when implementing these features to ensure they behave as expected under different scenarios."},{"prompt":"Thanks I will keep that in mind! I have a new question, should I use SDL_Log like for example here: SDL_Log(\\"ERROR: Failed to switch mode: %sn\\", SDL_GetError()); if I don\'t want to expose the SDL library to the game itself? Should I just throw an exception here with that text instead?","completion":"If you want to avoid exposing SDL to the game itself and keep the underlying implementation details hidden, using `SDL_Log` directly in the higher-level game code might not align well with this goal. Instead, you will want to abstract away the logging mechanism as well. Let\'s consider a couple of approaches: # Exceptions Throwing an exception is one way to signal an error without directly using SDL functions in the game code. Exceptions allow calling code to handle errors flexibly. This mechanism is ideal for handling situations that are truly exceptional and cannot be handled locally. ```cpp if (SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, r, g, b, a) != 0) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Failed to set the render draw color: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } ``` In this case, the calling code would need to be prepared to catch and handle `std::runtime_error` (or a more specific custom exception type if you define one). # Custom Logging Function You could also provide a custom logging function that internally uses `SDL_Log`. That way, the game code uses your logging function, and you can easily swap out the logging mechanism later if needed. ```cpp namespace GameEngine { void LogError(const std::string& message) { SDL_Log(\\"ERROR: %sn\\", message.c_str()); // If you ever switch away from SDL, you would only have to change this implementation. } } ``` Then the usage within your Renderer class might look something like this: ```cpp if (SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, r, g, b, a) != 0) { GameEngine::LogError(\\"Failed to set the render draw color: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } ``` # Mix of Both There is an argument to be made for using both. You can throw an exception for unexpected errors that the game should know about and use logging for less critical issues that should be recorded but don\'t necessarily require the game to handle them directly. ```cpp // Potentially recoverable error or notable event - log it if (minor_error_condition) { GameEngine::LogError(\\"Minor error occurred: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } // Critical issue - throw an exception if (major_error_condition) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Critical error occurred: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } ``` # Conclusion Exceptions are a common way to handle errors in C++ and can be preferred when you want the caller to have control over the recovery strategy. Meanwhile, logging is commonplace for recording information. Using `SDL_Log` within your internal implementation of a logging function allows you to hide the dependency on SDL and maintain a consistent logging interface for your game code. Finally, you may have noticed that converting `SDL_GetError()` to `std::string` is a recurring pattern. You might want to create a utility function to automatically get the SDL error message as a `std::string` to simplify your code: ```cpp std::string GetSDLError() { return std::string(SDL_GetError()); } ``` This would simplify the call to: ```cpp GameEngine::LogError(\\"Recoverable error occurred: \\" + GetSDLError()); // Or for exceptions: throw std::runtime_error(\\"Unrecoverable error occurred: \\" + GetSDLError()); ``` Whatever approach you choose, it\'s important to be consistent throughout your codebase."},{"prompt":"Should I make a Logger class even thought it is so early in development, should I just use write line in the terminal or just leave it a commentary for now?","completion":"The decision to implement a Logger class early in development depends on the complexity of your project and how much you value logging during development. Here are a few points to consider for each approach: # Implement a Logger Class Early - **Proactive Approach**: By setting up a logging system early, you\'ll have a robust mechanism in place for diagnosing issues from the start. - **Consistency**: Having a consistent logging interface means that as your codebase grows, all logging will already be routed through a single point, which can then be easily redirected, formatted, or filtered. - **Error Tracking**: Even in early development stages, having logs can help track down when and where things go wrong, which can be especially useful if you encounter intermittent or hard-to-reproduce issues. - **Future Proofing**: Implementing the Logger class early on means if you decide to change the underlying logging implementation (e.g., to write to a file or to integrate a third-party service), you\'ll only need to update the Logger class and not every instance of logging throughout your code. # Simple WriteLine Logging or Comments - **Speed**: You can get started coding your engine\'s core features immediately without having to design a logging system. - **Simplicity**: Writing directly to the terminal or adding comments to indicate where logging might eventually occur keeps the initial code base simple and focused on functionality. - **Flexibility**: By not committing to a particular logging approach, you leave your options open to design the logging system later based on the specific needs that emerge. # Middle Ground A compromise might be to implement a simple, lightweight logging class or function that you can expand upon later. For example: ```cpp class Logger { public: static void Log(const std::string& message) { std::cout << message << std::endl; // Future implementation can add file logging, severity levels, etc. } // Additional methods for different log levels could be added later: // static void Warn(const std::string& message); // static void Error(const std::string& message); // etc. }; ``` Starting with a simple `Log` method allows you to replace `std::cout` calls with `Logger::Log` throughout your codebase. Then, when your project is more mature, you can expand the `Logger` class to include features like log levels, file output, and formatting without having to change the rest of your code. # Summary It ultimately depends on your development style and the scale of your project. If your project is small and exploratory, using `std::cout` or temporary comments might be sufficient. However, if your project has the potential to grow significantly or you already know you\'ll need detailed logs, it would be wise to establish a simple logging mechanism early on. By laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive logging system now, you can incrementally build out its functionality as your game engine becomes more complex and the need for sophisticated logging increases."},{"prompt":"Ok I have everything set up now, but I have a question, I see these code snippets in the SDL sample project: if (SDL.SDL_Init(SDL.SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {...} and SDL_Quit(); Where should I place these things that are related to SDL and not directly to the Window or the Renderer? Should I create another class? If so, should it be a singleton to initialize or what? I think I am missing a link that connect everything together, maybe an Engine class?","completion":"The initialization and shutdown of SDL are fundamental steps that should occur only once in the application\'s lifetime. Typically, you would handle these steps in a centralized location that manages the entire lifespan of your SDL application. This could be in the `main` function, a dedicated `Application` or `Engine` class, or a singleton/context object that encapsulates all SDL-related operations. # Using an Engine Class An `Engine` class is a good choice for encapsulating engine-level operations, which include the initialization of subsystems such as SDL, creating a window, setting up the renderer, and managing the game loop. Here\'s an example of what the Engine class might look like: ```cpp class Engine { public: Engine() { // Constructor if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"SDL could not initialize! SDL Error: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } // You could also set up more subsystems here (audio, joystick, etc.) } ~Engine() { // Destructor SDL_Quit(); } void Run() { // Main game loop goes here } // Other methods to set up window, renderer, etc. }; ``` You would then use this class in your `main` function: ```cpp int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { try { Engine engine; engine.Run(); } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << \\"Unhandled Exception: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; return -1; } return 0; } ``` # Singleton Approach While singletons can be useful for ensuring a class has only one instance (such as an `Engine` or `Application` context in your case), they come with their own set of concerns. Singletons are often criticized for their global state, difficulty in testing, and potentially creating dependencies and coupling issues. If you do choose to implement your engine context as a singleton, here\'s how you might do it: ```cpp class Engine { public: static Engine& Instance() { static Engine instance; // Guaranteed to be destroyed and instantiated on first use return instance; } // Initializations in constructor / shutdown in destructor as before void Run() { // Main game loop } private: Engine() { // Constructor with SDL initialization } ~Engine() { // Destructor with SDL cleanup } // C++ 11 // Delete the methods we don\'t want to accidentally use Engine(Engine const&) = delete; // Copy constructor void operator=(Engine const&) = delete; // Assignment operator // Other private methods and state as needed }; ``` And the `main` function would look like this: ```cpp int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { try { Engine::Instance().Run(); } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << \\"Unhandled Exception: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; return -1; } return 0; } ``` # Conclusion Whether you opt for a singleton or a regular class instantiation depends on your specific design choices and requirements. However, it\'s generally recommended to use singletons sparingly and carefully consider their impacts on the codebase. An `Engine` class, whether a singleton or not, is a clean way to manage SDL\'s lifecycle, serve as the entry point for your application, and create any additional global resources or managers. It also provides a clear structure for expanding the game engine\'s capabilities later."},{"prompt":"I want the main game loop to be in the game, not the engine, since the game will use parts of the engine to work, so I don\'t know how to manage this, since the Run method shouldn\'t be in the Engine itself since the developer is going to be interacting with each engine subsystem separately","completion":"In that case, indeed, the `Engine` class should focus more on the lifecycle management of the engine\'s subsystems and provide interfaces for a game to interact with each subsystem rather than directly controlling the game loop. The main game loop would instead reside within the game-specific code, which uses the `Engine` and its subsystems to carry out the game logic. The `Engine` class could be structured like this: ```cpp class Engine { public: Engine() { if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"SDL could not initialize! SDL Error: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } // Initialize other subsystems as necessary (audio, input, etc.) } ~Engine() { SDL_Quit(); } // Public interface for various subsystems (window, renderer, input, audio, etc.) Window& GetWindow() { /* return reference to window object */ } Renderer& GetRenderer() { /* return reference to renderer object */ } // ...other subsystem getter methods... void InitializeSubsystems() { // Create and initialize engine subsystems like window, renderer, etc. } void ShutdownSubsystems() { // Clean up subsystems } // ... other engine management methods ... private: // Private members for subsystems like window, renderer, etc. }; ``` And in the game code, you can create an instance of `Engine`, initialize it, and start the main loop: ```cpp class Game { public: Game(Engine& engine) : engine(engine) { // Initialize game state, load assets, etc. } void Run() { // Main game loop while (!shouldQuit) { // Handle input // Update game logic // Render } } private: Engine& engine; bool shouldQuit = false; }; ``` Finally, in your `main` function, you would set up the engine and then create and run your game instance: ```cpp int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { try { Engine engine; engine.InitializeSubsystems(); Game game(engine); game.Run(); // Game now controls its own main loop engine.ShutdownSubsystems(); } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << \\"Unhandled Exception: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; return -1; } return 0; } ``` This separation allows the `Engine` to manage the fundamental SDL operations and subsystem management, while the `Game` class manages the game-specific logic and loop. This design aligns well with the idea of an engine as a toolbox and a game as the creation built using those tools. Each subsystem of the engine can be accessed and used independently within the `Game`\'s main loop, and the `Engine` itself does not dictate the flow of the game logic."},{"prompt":"OK I am slowly getting the idea on this, say I have every subsystem as Singleton global objects, so ScreenManager, AudioManager, InputManager, etc. and they don\'t need to be initialized since they are static and you can just use their code without an object, also they have their own constructor (getinstance) and destructor, how would that change the Engine class?","completion":"If each of your subsystems like `ScreenManager`, `AudioManager`, `InputManager`, etc. are implemented as singletons with their own initialization and cleanup logic, then your `Engine` class might not need to manage the lifecycle of these individual subsystems explicitly. Instead, the `Engine` could focus on general startup and shutdown procedures, possibly including global states or configurations that apply to the entire engine. Here\'s how the `Engine` class might look with singleton subsystems: ```cpp class Engine { public: Engine() { if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) < 0) { // Initialize all SDL subsystems throw std::runtime_error(\\"SDL could not initialize! SDL Error: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } // Additional global initialization can be done here if needed. } ~Engine() { // Any global cleanup can be done here. SDL_Quit(); } // The Engine class no longer needs methods to access the subsystems since they are singletons. // If global configurations or states are needed, methods to set or retrieve them would be added here. }; ``` Since each subsystem manager is a singleton, they would each have a static method to access their instance: ```cpp class ScreenManager { public: static ScreenManager& Instance() { static ScreenManager instance; return instance; } // ScreenManager methods ... private: ScreenManager() { // Initialize ScreenManager specifics... } ~ScreenManager() { // Cleanup... } // Singleton protections... ScreenManager(ScreenManager const&) = delete; void operator=(ScreenManager const&) = delete; }; // AudioManager, InputManager, etc., would have a similar structure. ``` And the `main` function can directly call into these singleton instances as needed: ```cpp int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { try { Engine engine; // Initialize SDL and any other global states // Now singletons can be accessed and used without explicitly passing around an Engine instance. auto& screenManager = ScreenManager::Instance(); auto& audioManager = AudioManager::Instance(); // Other subsystem instances... // Game loop or other initialization... } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << \\"Unhandled Exception: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; return -1; } return 0; } ``` In this setup, each manager is responsible for its own setup and teardown, and this is hidden behind the singleton interface. When an application or game wants to interact with a subsystem, it simply requests the instance of the singleton. Keep in mind that while singletons provide convenient global access and ensure a single instance, they can have drawbacks like making testing more challenging, possibly creating hidden dependencies, and making it harder to control the initialization order (which can be problematic when one singleton depends on another). Singletons can work well for global-access objects where there is a clear case that only one instance should exist, but consider carefully whether their use aligns with your engine\'s architecture and future scalability needs."},{"prompt":"ciao","completion":"Ciao!

HAUNTED CASTLE MANCAVE - NIGHT The dimly lit mancave exudes a strange mix of gothic grandeur and modern debauchery. Gothic arches and cobwebbed chandeliers loom over plush sofas, a bar stocked with eerie bottles of spirits, and a conspicuously out-of-place, glistening stripper pole. SKEWERED SOUL, a young man with a perpetually perplexed look, sits nervously on one of the sofas, a cold sweat beading on his brow. A thick cloud of tension dissipates as the room\'s owner saunters in. The DEMON COWBOY, an outrageous caricature of the seven deadly sins with a penchant for pink, clicks his silver spurs across the stone floor, adjusting his pink, studded belt and tipping his pink cowboy hat. DEMON COWBOY (grinning playfully) Well, howdy there, Skewed—can I call ya Skewed? I just love a bit of fun with names. Welcome to the wildest mancave in the underworld! SKEWERED SOUL (stammering) Uh, sure, I guess... call me whatever. This is all a bit... unexpected. In the corner, two GHOSTS spectate with expressions of eternal discomfort. NIGHTGOWN GHOST, an incorporeal matron stuck in her bedtime best, clutches her ethereal garment in disgust. FELDMARSHALL PHANTOM, a stern specter still donning his long-forgotten uniform, recoils with a grimace. NIGHTGOWN GHOST (whispering) Please, not the pole dancing again. It\'s more than my dead heart can take. FELDMARSHALL PHANTOM (sighing) I\'ve seen horrors, but this frivolous fiend is beyond my comprehension. DEMON COWBOY (locking eyes with Skewered Soul) You see, Skew, I\'m the embodiment of a sin, and I can guess what you\'re thinking—it\'s Lust, ain\'t it? Heh, can\'t blame ya for that guess. But nope, I\'m Sloth through and through. Skewered Soul\'s eyes widen in shock as Demon Cowboy lazily twirls his finger, summoning an unseen force that rustles his pink G-string in a way that defies the laws of physics—or taste. SKEWERED SOUL (squirming) Sloth? You... don\'t seem very slothful. DEMON COWBOY (winking) Oh, partner, you\'ve no idea. All this—gesturing at the suggestive attire—is because I can\'t be bothered to dress fully. And why stand when you can dance... slooowly? A western tune with an eerie undertone begins to play. The Demon Cowboy begins a languid, seductive dance around the stripper pole, shooting finger-guns at Skewered Soul and the ghosts. His silver revolvers glint in the low light, untouched in their holsters. NIGHTGOWN GHOST (to Feldmarshall Phantom) We\'re trapped in the spectral realm with this... this... FELDMARSHALL PHANTOM (finishing her sentence) ...Lascivious lollygagger? Ja, it is our endless curse. As Demon Cowboy\'s hips gyrate with a lethal laziness, nightmarish inflatable decorations start popping up around the room, nodding their heads to the rhythm. An inflatable pink flamingo wearing a cowboy hat joined by a skeletal horse with heart-shaped glasses bob along. DEMON COWBOY (flirty) I\'m just a soul with too much time and too little to do. You\'ll learn to love the slothful life, Skewy. Time here moves like molasses on a chilly day. SKEWERED SOUL (gulping) I think I need to slow my roll right out of this room... Just as Skewered Soul tries to make his escape, he finds himself mysteriously sliding—very slowly—back to the sofa, his attempts to flee thwarted by Sloth, the sneaky sin. The ghosts exchange glances, their ectoplasmic forms shimmering with sympathy. DEMON COWBOY (drawing out his words) There’s no rush, little buddy. You’ve got all eternity to enjoy... the show. As the Demon Cowboy leaps onto the pole for another round of slothful seduction, the room fills with eerie applause from unseen hands, and Skewered Soul realizes he\'s stuck watching the unholy rodeo for a while longer, caught between laughter and horror."},{"prompt":"Известно, что комплементарные цепи нуклеиновых кислот антипараллельны (5\' концу в одной цепи соответствует 3\' конец другой цепи).

Tesla vallási hite pontos természetére vonatkozóan nem sok konkrét információ maradt fenn, habár egyes életrajzi források említést tesznek arról, hogy mélyen spirituális ember volt és hisz valamiféle univerzális harmóniában, ami összeköti a fizikai világot. Az irodalom néha ellentmondásos információkat tartalmaz Tesla spirituális nézeteiről és egyéni vallásos meggyőződéséről. Néhány forrás azt sugallja, hogy Tesla a szabad gondolkodókhoz tartozott, akik nem ragaszkodnak szigorúan egyházi dogmákhoz, hanem a természeti törvényekben és az univerzumban rejlő rendben találják meg a spiritualitásukat. Az is ismert, hogy Tesla érdeklődött a metafizika iránt és nyitott volt az emberi értelem határain túli lehetőségekre, beleértve az olyan eszméket, mint az éter, ami egyfajta közös univerzális közegként funkcionált az ő koncepciójában. Tesla konkrétan nem dokumentálta hosszasan vallási nézeteit, így személyes Istenben való hitéről vagy egyéb vallásos meggyőződéseiről nincs egyértelmű nyilatkozat. Ezért arra a kérdésre, hogy \\"Hitt-e Istenben Nikola Tesla?\\", a legpontosabb válasz valószínűleg az, hogy Tesla egyéni és komplex vallásos vagy spirituális nézetet vallott, amely nehezen sorolható be a hagyományos vallási kategóriákba."},{"prompt":"Létezik olyan emberi cselekedet vagy döntés amelynek nincs oka?","completion":"Ez egy bonyolult filozófiai kérdés, amelyet évszázadok óta vizsgálnak gondolkodók a determinizmus, az akarat szabadsága és a kauzalitás kontextusában. Vannak eltérő vélemények arról, hogy minden emberi cselekedetnek van-e valamilyen oka, vagy lehetséges-e teljesen okszerűtlen döntést hozni. Azok, akik a determinizmust támogatják, úgy gondolják, hogy minden cselekedetet meghatároz előző állapotok egy sorozata, beleértve a biológiai, pszichológiai és környezeti tényezőket. E szerint a nézet szerint, még ha egy döntés véletlenszerű vagy spontánnak tűnik is, mindig van mögötte ok-okozati lánc, ami azt előidézi. Mások, akik az indeterminizmust vagy a libertarianizmust hirdetik, úgy vélik, hogy az akarat szabadsága lehetővé teszi az emberek számára, hogy valóban szabadon, okoktól függetlenül döntsenek. Ez a nézet arra utal, hogy vannak olyan döntések vagy cselekedetek, amelyeket nem határoz meg semmiféle előre meghatározott körülmény vagy korábbi esemény, hanem az emberek képesek cselekedni és dönteni úgy, hogy ez nem tulajdonítható semmilyen megelőző oknak. A tudomány, különösen a neuropszichológia és a viselkedési genetika területei, arra törekszik, hogy megértse az emberi döntések mögötti összetett rendszerek működését és összekapcsolódását. A kutatások azt sugallják, hogy számos láthatatlan erő és mechanizmus befolyásolja döntésinket, amelyeket gyakran nem vagyunk teljes mértékben tudatában. Végül a kérdés, hogy létezik-e oka nélküli emberi cselekedet vagy döntés, valószínűleg a szemlélő nézőpontjától függ. Minden érvényes válasz legalább részben támaszkodik filozófiai, tudományos, és személyes nézetekre. Az emberek sokszor úgy érzik, hogy döntéseik öntudatosak és szabad akaratuk eredményei, de nehéz empirikusan bizonyítani az okszerűtlenség vagy okoktól független akarat teljes és abszolút létezését."},{"prompt":"Létezik objektív emberi döntés ha a determinizmus igaz,","completion":"A determinizmus azt az álláspontot képviseli, hogy minden esemény, beleértve az emberi gondolatokat, döntéseket és cselekvéseket is, az univerzum előző állapotából következik az ok-okozati összefüggéseknek megfelelően. Ha az univerzum valóban teljes mértékben determinisztikus, akkor minden döntés, amit hozunk, már előre meghatározott és okszerűen következik korábbi eseményekből és állapotokból. Ebben a kontextusban az \\"objektív emberi döntés\\" kifejezés alatt valószínűleg olyan döntést értünk, amelyet semmilyen személyes vagy szubjektív elfogultság, érzelem vagy hajlam nem befolyásol. Azonban, ha a determinizmus értelmezése szerint minden döntésünk egy előre meghatározott eseménysorozat eredménye, akkor az elképzelés az objektív döntésekről mint kívül eső dolgokról a determinisztikus világképen belül értelmetlenné válik. Minden döntésünk alapvetően a korábbi okok hosszú láncolatából származna, azokat pedig objektív tényezők is befolyásolják. Az objektivitás fogalmát általában úgy értelmezzük, hogy ki van zárva a szubjektív hatásokból és elfogultságból, és alapja a tényszerűségen vagy valami külső realitáson. Mindazonáltal, determinisztikus világkép mellett minden ilyen \\"objektív\\" döntés is csak az előző okok logikai következménye lenne. A filozófiában a kompatibilizmus az az álláspont, amely megtalálja a módját annak, hogy összeegyeztetje a determinizmust az akarat szabadságának érzésével. A kompatibilisták szerint még ha minden cselekedet mögött is valamiféle ok áll, az emberi döntések mégis szabadnak és felelőssé teljesnek tekinthetők egy bizonyos kontextusban. Ez azon az elképzelésen alapszik, hogy az akarat szabadsága nem feltételezi a teljesen okszerűtlen cselekedetek lehetőségét, hanem azt, hogy cselekedeteink általában összhangban vannak vágyainkkal, szándékainkkal és érzelmeinkkel, amelyek maguk is determinisztikus okok sorozatából erednek. Összefoglalva, ha a determinizmus igaz, az egyén döntéseit nem lehet teljesen objektív módon értékelni, mivel minden döntés a múlt eseményeinek determinisztikus sorozata által meghatározott. Emellett a determinizmus mellett az akarat szabadsága és az objektív döntéshozatal fogalmai átértelmezést és további filozófiai magyarázatot igényelnek."},{"prompt":"Hogyan egyeztethető össze az éntudat a determinizmussal?","completion":"Az éntudat és a determinizmus összeegyeztetése régóta foglalkoztatja a filozófusokat, pszichológusokat és tudósokat. Az éntudat azt a bonyolult képességünket jelenti, miszerint tudatában vagyunk saját mentális állapotainknak, gondolatainknak, érzéseinknek, szándékainknak és cselekedeteinknek, illetve az énünk önreflexív szemlélete. A determinizmus, másrészt, az az elgondolás, hogy minden esemény, beleértve gondolatainkat és cselekedeteinket is, előre meghatározott és ok-okozati láncolatok által vezérelt. Filozófiai szempontból a kompatibilizmus (vagy lágy determinizmus) az az álláspont, amely megpróbálja összeegyeztetni az éntudatot és az akarat szabadságát a determinizmussal. A kompatibilisták úgy érzik, hogy az akarat szabadsága nem feltétlenül azt jelenti, hogy cselekedeteink okszerűtlenek vagy teljesen véletlenszerűek. Ehelyett az akarat szabadságát mint kompatibilis szemléletmódot arra használják, hogy leírják, hogyan hozhatnak döntéseket az emberek, amikor nem akadályozzák meg őket kényszerítő külső tényezők. A következő módokon értelmezik néhányan a kompatibilizmust, hogy összeegyeztessék az éntudatot a determinizmussal: 1. Szándékos cselekvés: Bár a cselekvéseink okszerűen meghatározottak lehetnek, az éntudat és a szándékos cselekvés lehetővé teszi, hogy összhangban legyenek vágyainkkal, érdekünkkel és céljainkkal. Így ezeket a cselekvéseket \\"szabadnak\\" nevezhetjük olyan értelemben, hogy tükrözik személyes szándékainkat és választásainkat. 2. Az okok belsővé tétele: Az éntudat lehetővé teszi, hogy asszimiláljuk és belsővé tegyük azokat az okokat, amelyek minket mozgatnak. Bár ezek az okok meghatározhatják a viselkedésünket, úgy vélekedhetünk róluk, mint az önazonosságunk és identitásunk részéről, így ezek az okok \\"énvezéreltek\\" lesznek. 3. Alternatíváknak érzékelt lehetősége: Az éntudat lehetővé teszi az emberek számára, hogy különböző lehetséges viselkedéseket képzeljenek el és mérlegeljenek azelőtt, hogy döntést hoznának. Ez az érzékelt választási lehetőség összhangban van az akarat szabadságának élményével, még a determinizmus igazolása mellett is. 4. Morális felelősség: Az éntudatos egyének képesek arra, hogy előretekintsenek a cselekvéseik következményeire és erkölcsi szempontból mérlegeljenek. A felelősségteljes választások lehetősége a determinizmus mellett is fennmaradhat, mivel az egyének képesek szándékos cselekvéseikkel befolyásolni jövőbeli eseményeket. Természetesen ezek a megközelítések nem foglalkoznak mindenkinek megnyugtatóan az éntudat és a determinizmus közötti feszültséggel. Vannak, akik úgy vélik, hogy a teljes determinizmus aláásná az akarat szabadságát és az önazonosság és felelősség hagyományos érzetét. Az inkompatibilisták vagy hard deterministák szerint, ha minden ténylegesen determinisztikus, akkor az éntudat illúzió lehet, vagy teljes mértékben összeegyeztethetetlen a valódi akarat szabadságával. Ez a téma a filozófiában továbbra is heves viták tárgyát képezi, és eltérő nézetek állnak szemben egymással a tudomány, a filozófia, a pszichológia és más kapcsolódó tudományágak területén."},{"prompt":"Ockham borotvája mint filozófiai elv miért nem használható Isten létének cávolására?","completion":"Ockham borotvája, vagy Occam borotvája, egy filozófiai és tudományos alapelv, amely William of Ockham angol ferences barát és filozófus nevéhez fűződik, aki a 14. században élt. Az elvet gyakran így fogalmazzák meg: \\"Az egyenértékű magyarázatok közül a legszűkszegesebbet kell választani\\" vagy \\"Nem szabad több dolgot feltételezni, mint amennyire szükség van\\". Az alapelv segít a teóriák és magyarázatok egyszerűsítésében és könnyebb érthetőségében, kiemelve, hogy a kevesebb hipotézis és feltételezés általában jobb, amennyiben ezek elegendőek a megfigyelt jelenségek leírására. Azonban Ockham borotvája önmagában nem egy cáfolható állítás vagy bizonyíték, hanem egy heurisztikus eszköz, amit a tudományban és a filozófiában az egyszerűsítés és a gazdaságosság előmozdítására használnak. Ez az elv azt sugallja, hogy amikor több lehetséges magyarázatot lehet alkalmazni a megfigyelésekre, akkor az egyszerűbb (kevesebb nem igazolt entitást vagy hipotézist felhasználó) magyarázatot kellene előnyben részesíteni. Isten létének kérdésében Ockham borotvája nem feltétlenül alkalmazható egyenes bizonyítékként Isten létezésének cáfolására vagy igazolására, mert ez a kérdés túlmutat a szigorúan empirikus vagy tudományos bizonyítékon. Vallási hit és teológiai doktrínák gyakran olyan metatudományos területek, melyek nem minden esetben tartanak fenn közvetlen ok-okozati kapcsolatokat a mérhető vagy megfigyelhető világgal. Isten létének vagy nem-létének az állítása jellegénél fogva nem feltétlenül engedelmeskedik ugyanazon szempontoknak, mint a tapintható, természettudományos hipotézisek. Továbbá, azok számára, akik hisznek Isten létezésében, Isten nem egy opcionális hipotézis vagy feltárt entitás, hanem az univerzum és annak működésének alapvető okának vagy magyarázatának tekinthető. Ezért ők azzal érvelhetnek, hogy Isten létezése nem valami, ami „kivágható” Ockham borotvájával, mert számukra ez az alapelv, amelyre más magyarázatokat vagy megközelítéseket kell alapozni. Végül is Ockham borotvája egy gondolkodási és értelmezési eszköz, és mint minden ilyen eszköz, ennek használata is kontextustól és célkitűzésektől függ. Ez nem bizonyíték vagy cáfolat maga, hanem egy módszer, amely segít nekünk hatékonyabban gondolkodni az univerzumról és annak jelenségeiről."},{"prompt":"Élt-e a történelem során olyan tudós, melynek a későbbiek folyamán bebizonyosodott, hogy kutatási eredményei tévesek és ezért öngyilkos lett?","completion":"Ilyen specifikus esetekről nem tudok, ahol egy tudós a későbbi bizonyítékok miatt vett volna véget az életének, kizárólag azért, mert kutatási eredményei tévesnek bizonyultak.

Ennek ellenére a tudományos közösség általában elfogadja, hogy a hiba és a korrekció a tudományos folyamat szerves részét képezik. Az eltelt évek során voltak olyan tudósok, akik meglehetősen extrém stresszhelyzetbe kerültek a munkájuk és a kutatási eredmények központú viták, illetve az akadémiai és társadalmi nyomás miatti csalódottságuk vagy megaláztatásuk során.

Tudománytörténetben sokkal szélesebb körben dokumentált a tény, hogy a kutatási eredményeket és elméleteket idővel felülírják, módosítják vagy teljesen félredobnak, amit a kutatók általában úgy kezelnek, mint a tudomány fejlődésének természetes részét."},{"prompt":"Mondj néhány ilyen tudóst.","completion":"Tudománytörténet során voltak olyan tudósok, akiknek munkája vagy elméletei idővel elavulnakak, helytelennek vagy tévesnek bizonyultak, de olyan tudósokról nincs tudomásom, akik közvetlenül ezért öngyilkosságot követtek volna el. Az alábbiakban felsorolok néhány történelmi példát tudósokra, akiknek munkásságát később megkérdőjelezték vagy cáfolták: 1. **Georges Lemaître** - Lemaître belga római katolikus pap, csillagász és fizikus volt, aki az 1920-as években a \\"Nagy Bumm\\" elméletét javasolta, ami később a nagy robbanás (Big Bang) néven ismertté vált. Bár kezdetben sokan szkeptikusok voltak, később bebizonyosodott, hogy az elmélete helyes volt. 2. **Ignaz Semmelweis** - Semmelweis osztrák-magyar orvos volt, akit sokan \\"az anyák megmentőjeként\\" ismernek. Felfedezte, hogy ha az orvosok kézfertőtlenítést végeznek, mielőtt hozzájuk érnek a gyermekágyi lázas betegekhez, jelentősen csökkenthetik a halálozási rátát. Kollégái közötti konfliktusai miatt elfelejtették kutatásait, és Semmelweis pszichiátriai intézetben halt meg sajnos. 3. **Alfred Wegener** - Wegener, egy német meteorológus, a geofizika és a kutató először vetette fel a kontinentális drift vagy lemeztektonika elméletét, amely szerint a földkéreg mozgó lemezekből áll, amik idővel változtatják a kontinensek helyzetét. Az elmélete a kezdeti bemutatása után sok csúfolódot és kritikát kapott, de már a halála után fogadták el, mint valódi tudományos meglátását. Wegener azonban nem öngyilkosság miatt halt meg, hanem Grönlandon egy tudományos kutató expedíció során. Ezek a példálódzási esetek bemutatják, hogy bár a tudóstársadalom kezdetben gyakran skeptikusan fogadja az újító vagy radikális elméleteket, a tudomány haladása során ezek az elméletek gyakran később elfogadottá válhatnak, miután több bizonyíték gyűlt össze azok támasztására. A tudóstörténet során számos esetet találunk, ahol tudósok kutatási eredményei vitatottak voltak, de öngyilkosságot közvetlenül a kutatási eredmények következményeként elkövetni rendkívül ritka és specifikus esemény lenne, amelynek dokumentálva kellene lennie és megfelelő bizonyítékkal alátámasztva }))."},{"prompt":"Melyek azok a történészek akik írtak a történelmi Jézus létezéséről?","completion":"A történelmi Jézust kutató történészek és régészek, valamint a vallástörténészek és biblikus tudósok az elmúlt századokban és napjainkban is vizsgálták Jézus életét és korát. A történelmi Jézus létezéséről szóló források jellegzetesen a következő csoportokba sorolhatók: 1. **Korai keresztény források:** Ezek az Újszövetség írásai, különösen a négy kanonikus evangélium (Máté, Márk, Lukács, János), az Apostolok Cselekedetei, Pál levelei és egyéb ókori keresztény szövegek. Bár ezek elsődlegesen vallási dokumentumok, tartalmazzák az eddigi legkorábbi és legrészletesebb leírásokat Jézusról. 2. **Római szerzők:** Több római történész és szerző is említi a keresztényeket vagy magát Jézust. A legnevesebbek közé tartozik Tacitus, aki a \\"Történetek\\" (Annales) című művében említést tesz a keresztények üldözéséről Neró császár idején, és hivatkozik a \\"Christus\\"-ra, akinek halála okozta a mozgalom megjelenését. 3. **Zsidó források:** Az egyik legismertebb referencia József Flávius zsidó történésztől származik, aki a \\"A zsidók története\\" (Antiquitates Judaicae) című munkájában említi Jézust, bár e szakasz hitelességét a tudományos közösségben vita övezi, mivel vannak utólag hozzáadott (interpolált) részek, amelyek az eredeti szöveghez képest keresztény redakciók lehetnek. 4. **Korai nem keresztény források:** Néhány további nem keresztény író, mint például Plinius a kisebb, Suetonius és mások hivatkoznak a korai keresztényekre, amelyek közvetett információt nyújthatnak Jézusról, bár őket magukat ritkán említik. Jézus történelmi létezőként való elfogadása széles körben konszenzus a történészek és a vallástudományi szakemberek között, annak ellenére, hogy a források meglehetősen későn keletkeztek az élete után és vallási előítélettel lehetnek terhelve. Ezek a források és azok történelmi elemzése, valamint a korai kereszténység és a régi Közel-Kelet régészeti leletei az eddigi legjobb eszközök Jézus történelmi alakjának rekonstruálásához."},{"prompt":"Az egyiptomi Hórusz élete valóban sokban hasonlít a krisztuséhoz és Jézust valójában Hóruszról mintázták?","completion":"Az elmélet, miszerint Jézus életét az egyiptomi Hórusz vallási mítoszáról mintázták, egy modern spekuláció, amely népszerűvé vált bizonyos kritikusok és pseudo-tudományos művek körében, mint például az új vallástudomány és a konspirációs elméletek terén. Azonban a történelmi és vallástörténeti szakértők nagy része komoly fenntartásokkal kezeli azokat az állításokat, amelyek szerint a Krisztus-mítosz közvetlenül megfelelő lenne Hórusz történetével, vagy hogy Hórusz életének elemeit átültették volna Jézus történetébe. Hórusz egy fontos isten az ókori egyiptomi mitológiában, sokszor ábrázolva mint egy sólyomfejű ember vagy maga a sólyom, a Nap és az ég isteneként, valamint az uralkodó faraók védelmezőjeként tekinthető. Mivel az ókori egyiptomi hitvilág nagyon gazdag és sokszínű volt és változásokon ment keresztül az évezredek során, Hóruszhoz kapcsolódó számos mítosz és hagyomány létezik. Néhány hasonlóság Jézus és Hórusz közötti állított párhuzamok, mint például születésüket, csodáikat és haláluk utáni feltámadásukat az okkultizmus, az újpogányság és más alternatív spirituális nézetek támogatói között terjedt el. Az utóbbi évtizedek könyvei és dokumentumfilmjei, mint például \\"Zeitgeist: The Movie\\" újabb kapcsolatokat vélelmeztek, amelyek azonban gyakran alapszakmai forrásokra és tálalmi elemzésekre támaszkodnak. A vezető egyiptológusok, vallási történészek és bibliai tudósok többsége elutasítja azt a feltevést, hogy Jézus alakját és történetét direkt módon Hóruszról mintázták volna. A hasonlóságok gyakran túlzottan leegyszerűsítettek vagy értelmezéseken alapulnak, amelyek nem állják meg a helyüket a szigorú akadémiai kutatás szempontjából. Jézus alakját és tanításait leginkább a korabeli zsidó hagyományok határozták meg, illetve a római kor Palesztinájának komplex társadalmi és történelmi kontextusában értelmezendők. Mindemellett értékes az ókori vallási hagyományok, mítoszok és kultúrák összehasonlító tanulmányozása, amely segíthet felfedezni az emberi kultúra és spiritualitás közös elemeit.

When we talk about a company internalizing externalities, we mean that the company is taking into account the indirect costs (or benefits) its operations have on the environment, public health, and other areas not reflected in its financial accounts. For example, pollution is a negative externality that can cause health problems and environmental damage, but the company responsible for the pollution does not necessarily pay for these damages as part of its business expenses. If it\'s stated that BP (British Petroleum) did not internalize the externalities cost, it means that BP failed to take full responsibility for the environmental and social costs of its operations. Here are some possible areas where BP may have not internalized the externalities cost: 1. **Environmental Pollution**: If BP did not sufficiently invest in pollution control or mitigation technologies to reduce the environmental impact of its oil extraction, refining, and distribution operations, it could be said that the company did not internalize the full environmental cost of its activities. 2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: If BP emitted greenhouse gases without offsetting or taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, then it might be accused of not internalizing the global societal costs associated with climate change. 3. **Oil Spills and Accidents**: Notably, the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 was a catastrophic event where BP faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent the spill or address the immediate and long-term environmental damage it caused to marine life, ecosystems, and local economies dependent on those ecosystems. 4. **Health Impacts**: If BP\'s operations lead to air or water pollution that has negative health impacts on nearby communities, and BP did not compensate those affected or invest in reducing those health impacts, then it would not be internalizing those costs. 5. **Community Displacement or Impacts**: If BP\'s operations result in negative social impacts, such as displacing communities or adversely affecting local economies through resource depletion or environmental degradation, and does not remedy or compensate for these effects, it is not internalizing these externalities. When a company like BP does not internalize the full costs of these externalities, governments, local communities, and the natural environment often bear the burden. In some cases, companies may later face legal action, fines, cleanup costs, or reputational damage as a consequence of failing to internalize these costs. In response to such incidents and in the face of increasing public pressure, many oil companies, including BP, have since stated commitments to more sustainable practices and reducing their environmental impact. However, the efficacy and sincerity of these efforts are often scrutinized by external observers."},{"prompt":"Write the above with citation harvard style and with proper evidence.

Moreover, I can\'t access the internet to fetch current or historical data or generate commentary based on real-world evidence. Nonetheless, I can demonstrate how you might construct a commentary with hypothetical Harvard-style references, based on a fictional scenario where BP had failed to internalize external costs. Please note that this is purely illustrative: --- Commentary: The Real Costs of Ignoring Environmental Externalities: The BP Case The environmental and social impact of large-scale industrial activities is a subject of increasing public and academic scrutiny. BP, as a major player in the oil and gas sector, has been at the center of numerous discussions concerning the internalization of externality costs—costs that arise from the company\'s operations but are not directly accounted for in its financial ledgers (Smith and Liu, 2021). When we consider externalities, we refer to the impacts that do not automatically translate into company costs. For BP, an infamous instance of such was the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which shed light on the considerable environmental and social costs of oil spill accidents. The spill, occurring in 2010, had devastating effects on marine ecosystems and local economies that relied on these natural resources (Johnson, 2020). Despite regulations and the company\'s commitments to safety and sustainability, criticisms continue that BP has not fully internalized the costs of pollution – a lingering testament to the grand-scale consequences when large corporates overlook their environmental responsibilities (Davis and Thompson, 2022). The issue of greenhouse gas emissions remains contentious, and it is here that BP, like many of its oil and gas counterparts, is said to fall short. The industry\'s contribution to climate change is a significant externality, with the burning of fossil fuels driving a myriad of climate-related issues. Although BP announced initiatives aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the effectiveness of these initiatives is debated among environmentalists who argue for more immediate action (Greenpeace, 2023). Another area where BP and similar companies are accused of not internalizing externalities is the health implications of pollution. Air quality issues arising from petroleum refineries have been linked to respiratory illnesses and other health problems in neighboring communities. Yet, there are allegations that the costs for these health problems are borne not by the company, but by the public health systems and the affected individuals themselves (Allen and Patel, 2021). The communities living in proximity to BP\'s activities sometimes also shoulder unaccounted costs. Resource depletion, environmental degradation, and community displacement have life-altering implications, and without adequate compensation or mitigation strategies, these costs are arguably externalized (White, 2022). In conclusion, while BP has made public overtures indicating a transition toward a more sustainable and responsible operational model, the task remains to tangibly internalize the costs of environmental and social externalities. The journey towards full accountability is complex, but it is also necessary if we are to avert the most damaging consequences of industrial negligence. --- *References:* Allen, J. & Patel, S.

Write this answer for me like commentary","completion":"Commentary: Lessons from Tragedy — Rana Plaza and Kunshan Explosions The Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh and the Kunshan factory explosion in China serve as harrowing reminders that industrial disasters are not mere accidents but often a result of systemic failures to prioritize workers\' safety and wellbeing. These incidents expose a stark reality: when profit margins take precedence over people, the consequences can be catastrophic. The collapse of Rana Plaza in 2013, which housed several garment factories, killed over 1,100 people and injured thousands more (Manik and Yardley, 2013). This tragedy highlighted the hazardous conditions workers in the global supply chain often face. The demand for cheap clothing, relentless pressure to cut costs, and inadequate regulatory oversight can lead to compromised safety standards. In the wake of the disaster, there were significant calls for reform. The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh was one such response, aiming to prevent such tragedies through rigorous safety inspections and worker empowerment initiatives (Berfield and Baumann, 2013). Similarly, the Kunshan explosion in 2014, at a metal products factory, killed nearly 100 people (Bradsher, 2014). The incident was attributed to poor handling of combustible dust, a known industrial hazard. Like Rana Plaza, the root causes behind the Kunshan explosion included regulatory lapses, insufficient safety measures, and an apparent disregard for the well-documented risks associated with the processing of fine metallic dusts. Both disasters share troubling commonalities: they occurred in factories that are cogs in the wheels of vast global supply chains, operated by workers under conditions that received little scrutiny until tragedy struck. The aftermath of these incidents has forced multinational corporations to reconsider their outsourcing strategies and supply chain oversight mechanisms. There has been an increased push towards transparency, ethical sourcing, and corporate accountability (Glader, 2015). Despite these advancements, the road ahead remains fraught with challenges. Compliance and enforcement of safety standards remain inconsistent. Moreover, global consumers are often disconnected from the realities of production, so the pressure for fast, cheap goods continues relatively unabated. Reflecting upon the human cost of Rana Plaza and the Kunshan explosion compels us to confront uncomfortable questions about consumer responsibility and the true price of capitalism\'s \'efficiencies.\' As we work towards a safer, more equitable world, these incidents must not be sidelined as foreign tragedies. Instead, they should serve as constant reminders—and catalysts for change—so that the dignity and safety of every worker become the bedrock principles of global industry. *References:* Berfield, S. and Baumann, P.

In your opinion, how could the corporation have internalized these costs for value creation?................Write the above in context of this question","completion":"Commentary: The High Price of Ignoring Externalities: A Reflection on Rana Plaza and Kunshan The catastrophic events at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh and the Kunshan factory in China starkly illustrate the consequences firms and society bear when corporations fail to internalize the costs of externalities. The tragic loss of life and subsequent financial, legal, and reputational costs to involved companies offer a grim lesson in the importance of integrating external costs into their business models. Externalities, particularly those related to environmental and social impacts, have traditionally been seen as peripheral concerns by many businesses, external to their balance sheets and thus, out of their immediate purview. However, the backlash in the aftermath of these disasters has demonstrated that such externalities can lead to significant internal financial costs and a loss of stakeholder value. The destruction of human life, environmental damage, and the subsequent erosion of social trust in these instances have forced a reevaluation of what true cost internalization entails. For corporations operating in high-risk industries or regions, internalizing these costs means adopting a holistic view of their operations. Had the firms involved in Rana Plaza and Kunshan been proactive in managing the risks associated with their operations, many lives could have been saved, and the costs to their businesses significantly reduced. Internalization could have taken several forms: 1. **Investing in Worker Safety**: Ensuring the physical safety of workers by investing in safe buildings, regular safety drills, and proper equipment would mitigate risks and potentially prevent disasters like Rana Plaza. 2. **Adopting Rigorous Standards**: Implementing and adhering to international standards for safety, such as ISO/SA8000, and conducting regular third-party audits could have identified and remedied the hazards that led to the Kunshan explosion. 3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Firms can internalize externalities by regularly engaging with stakeholders, including local communities, governments, and non-governmental organizations. This engagement can foster transparency and collaboration on issues of safety and environmental impact. 4. **Supply Chain Oversight**: Rigorous supply chain oversight through codes of conduct, compliance checks, and the integration of ethical sourcing criteria into procurement decisions are crucial for recognizing and mitigating risks. 5. **Incorporating External Costs into Pricing**: By factoring in the costs associated with externalities, such as pollution or health risks, into product pricing, companies can create a financial buffer for potential issues and demonstrate their commitment to responsible business practices. 6. **Sustainability and Social Responsibility**: Investment in sustainable practices, both environmental and social, is increasingly recognized as integral to long-term value creation. These practices can help prevent negative outcomes that stem from externalities. 7. **Establishing Emergency Funds**: Building emergency funds to cover potential adverse events and their fallout protects not only the workers and communities affected but also the company\'s financial health and reputation during crises. In these two cases, the clear lesson is that internalizing the costs associated with potential externalities before a crisis occurs is far less costly in the long run than reacting to a disaster. What’s more, internalizing these costs can create value for the firm in the form of enhanced reputation, increased customer loyalty, more engaged and productive workers, and reduced regulatory and legal risks. Crucially, corporate value creation must evolve to fully embrace the environmental and social dimensions of business. In the long term, the integration of these concerns into corporate strategy and decision-making is not just an ethical imperative but a business one, as companies that fail to do so risk their very viability. The Rana Plaza and Kunshan tragedies have shifted the dialogue from whether businesses should internalize external costs to how they can do so effectively. Corporations that succeed in this regard will likely find themselves leading the charge in a new era of responsible and profitable business. *Note: This commentary is for illustrative purposes and should be supported by real-world data and references when composed for actual use.*"},{"prompt":"Did the above companies recovered from the cost?","completion":"As an AI, I don\'t have real-time data, but I can provide information up to my last update in early 2023. For the Rana Plaza disaster, which involved several garment factories and not a single company, the recovery cannot be measured purely in terms of financial costs to specific companies. The global fashion brands associated with these factories faced intense scrutiny and reputational damage. The disaster sparked widespread demand for improved labor practices and greater supply chain transparency in the fashion industry. Brands and retailers associated with the factories were pressured to contribute to compensation funds for the victims and to invest in improving working conditions. The overall recovery of these companies from the reputational and financial fallout would vary individually depending on their subsequent actions and the perceptions of their stakeholders concerning their role in the systemic issues highlighted by the collapse. Regarding the Kunshan explosion, the affected company, Zhongrong Metal Production Company, and its customers faced a different set of challenges. The explosion not only inflicted a significant human toll but also led to economic losses and legal consequences. The aftermath saw Chinese authorities shutting down the facility and instituting a series of inspections and regulations aimed at improving industrial safety standards. Recovery in this context involves the potential for reopening, cost of regulatory compliance, legal penalties, and also the capacity to rebuild trust with clients and the workforce. The specific recovery trajectory for Zhongrong Metal Production Company would depend on their response to the incident, their financial resilience, and the broader economic and regulatory environment in China post-explosion. In both cases, the idea of “recovery” extends beyond the direct costs and encompasses longer-term impacts on brand reputation, regulatory compliance, workforce relations, and the broader industry practices. The true cost of these events includes both the immediate financial hit and the more extended implications for how businesses operate in a globalized and increasingly ethically conscious market. For specific information about the recovery of the companies involved, one would need to look at more recent financial reports, news articles, and industry analyses detailing their actions following these incidents and any changes in their business practices or financial status."},{"prompt":"Rana Plaza wasn\'t an accident; it was a preventable tragedy fueled by a toxic cocktail of unethical labor practices, lax safety standards, and rampant disregard for human life.

However, I can demonstrate how one would approach writing the commentary based on the given instructions using hypothetical data concerning a Mutual Fund/PE Fund with a sustainability strategy. --- **Commentary: Evaluating the Performance and Sustainability Strategy of the EcoGrowth Sustainability Fund** The EcoGrowth Sustainability Fund (ESF) stands as a prime example of an investment fund where sustainability is not merely an afterthought but is woven into the fabric of its investment philosophy and strategy. The ESF is pronounced in its commitment to catalyzing sustainable growth while delivering attractive returns to investors, balancing fiduciary duties with the pressing need for actionable environmental and social impact. Under the stewardship of Prime Asset Management, the ESF has delineated a sustainability strategy that adheres to the Sustainable Finance Framework underscoring integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations during the investment process. The fund methodically identifies companies that not only exhibit sound financial performance but also showcase robust sustainability practices, ranging from carbon footprint reduction initiatives to fair labor policies and corporate governance. The underlying selection process is underpinned by proprietary ESG analysis and external sustainability ratings, facilitating the accumulation of a diverse portfolio in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Critically examining ESF’s asset allocation reveals a deliberate tilt towards renewable energy, clean technology, and sustainable infrastructure projects; sectors indisputably pivotal to orchestrating a low-carbon economy. Additionally, significant investments in healthcare and education resonate with the fund’s propensity to support human capital development as a cornerstone of sustainable development. While this thematic prioritization is commendable, it raises questions on the portfolio\'s exposure to sector-specific risks and economic cycles, which could potentially impact performance during downturns in these sectors. The fund’s historical performance metrics depict a convincing argument for the integration of sustainability into asset management. With returns consistently surpassing its benchmark index, ESF exhibits that far from constraining performance, a sustainability-focused investment approach can uncover value drivers often overlooked by traditional analysis. However, it is imperative to consider the sustainability premium in terms of valuation models and longer time horizons necessitated to realize the full potential of such investments. This may influence the fund’s attractiveness for certain investors seeking shorter investment horizons. A stark point of contention often levied at funds such as ESF is the true depth of impact stemming from their investments. A rigorous critical examination must pierce through the prolific use of ESG jargon to discern tangible outcomes. The fund’s periodic impact reports elucidate strides made in emission reductions and contribution to economic empowerment in emerging markets. However, one must scrutinize the potential for greenwashing, the extent of influence the fund holds over corporate policies, and the real calculable impact versus proclaimed ESG contribution. The influence of the current context on the ESF’s strategy is palpable. Amidst burgeoning investor demand for responsible investment and heightened regulatory focus on sustainability disclosures, ESF presents an avant-garde blueprint for the fund management industry. The fund not merely aligns with prevailing trends but endeavors to set the precedent for genuine ESG integration, driving the entire market towards sustainable investing norms. Nonetheless, the fund operates within a broader financial ecosystem fraught with divergent definitions of sustainability, inconsistent reporting standards, and varying levels of stakeholder commitment to the ESG agenda—all of which can impact the fund’s operational effectiveness and the comparability of its sustainability outcomes. The ambition harbored by the ESF team is laudable. The fund’s position reflects a profound acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of financial returns, sustainability, and societal well-being. Acknowledging limits to this position, the fund does not discount traditional financial analysis; rather, it enriches financial due diligence with rigorous ESG scrutiny, allowing for a more comprehensive risk-return evaluation. By synthesizing the fund\'s sustainability ethos with practical investment acumen, the ESF endeavors to serve discerning investors staunchly situated at the confluence of profit and purpose. In conclusion, while the ESF can point to numerous successes and lessons learned, it’s the forward trajectory that will solidify its reputation. The fund’s structured approach to sustainability, coupled with consistent performance, heralds a progressive shift in investment paradigms. Yet, the sustainability sphere is in flux, necessitating continuous refinement of strategies, vigilance against complacency, and an unyielding commitment to navigating the evolving landscape of sustainable finance. As the fund continues to align capital with sustainable objectives, it will not only need to satisfy the demands of informed investors but also live up to the responsibility of paving the way towards a transformative model of investment that others in the industry may emulate. *Please note that the \\"EcoGrowth Sustainability Fund\\" and \\"Prime Asset Management\\" are fictitious names used for illustrative purposes and do not represent any real entities or investment strategies.* --- The instruction to critically evaluate the fund\'s performance and asset allocation would typically require an in-depth analysis of comprehensive data including, but not limited to, financial statements, sustainability and impact reports, market analysis, and expert opinions. Keep in mind that any commentary or evaluation should be supported by credible information and properly cited sources specific to the actual fund being analyzed."},{"prompt":"dissertation topics for msc finance students related to investment and risk.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. \'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows.

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give \'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.\' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they\'ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today\'s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I\'m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though.

As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB\'s Kids\' WB era is truly coming to an end. How\'s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It\'s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it\'s tough to imagine the block without them. I\'ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I\'m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they\'ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let\'s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I\'m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let\'s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids\' WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It\'s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie.

Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we\'re stepping into uncharted territory, let\'s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB\'s Kids\' WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you\'re so attached to the way things were. It\'s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here\'s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We\'re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I\'m torn between excitement for what\'s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don\'t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids\' WB classics, I\'m bracing myself. Still, progress isn\'t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB\'s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I\'m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition.

Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we\'ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV\'s announcers. Looks like they\'re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric\'s still holding down the fort in the bumpers...for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I\'m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I\'m expecting they\'ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids\' WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we\'ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It\'s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let\'s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV\'s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We\'ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I\'ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y\'know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap.

Visually, it\'s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend.

It\'s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they\'re pushing. Aside from \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. \\"Code Lyoko\\" and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, \\"Lyoko\\" has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for \\"Gloopy and Glitter,\\" its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. \\"Code Lyoko\\" has that futuristic vibe that\'s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" likely stayed because it adds variety – can\'t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is \'digital.\' User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM \\"Lyoko\\" might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that \\"Code Lyoko\\" cut it while other staples didn\'t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You\'re all spot-on with your insights! \\"Code Lyoko\\" has much to contribute to the technological ethos we\'re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we\'re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming\'s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like \\"Code Lyoko\\" – it\'s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn\'t love a splash of gooey positivity from \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet \\"Code Lyoko\\" is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it\'s paying off.

To manipulate ports in terms of opening or closing them, you would use a combination of Windows Firewall rules and services or applications that bind to these ports. Here’s how to add a rule to Windows Firewall to open a port: 1. Open Windows Defender Firewall: - Press `Win + R`, type `firewall.cpl`, and press `Enter`, OR - Search for \\"Windows Defender Firewall\\" in the Start menu and open it. 2. On the left, click on “Advanced settings” to open the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security window. 3. In the left pane, click on `Inbound Rules`. 4. On the right pane, click on “New Rule…” 5. In the New Inbound Rule Wizard, select `Port` and click `Next`. 6. Choose TCP or UDP as the type of port you’re opening, depending on your needs. 7. Enter the port number you want to open and click `Next`. 8. Choose `Allow the connection` and click `Next`. 9. If you want the rule to apply to domain, private, and/or public networks, check the appropriate boxes and click `Next`. 10. Give the rule a meaningful name and, if you like, a description. 11. Click `Finish` to create the rule. This rule will now allow traffic through the port you specified on the step of specifying the port number (7). To open a port, you also generally need a program or service that listens on that port. You configure the program or service itself to use the port; simply opening the port in the firewall doesn’t open it in the sense of making a program listen on it. If you have an existing service that should be listening on a port but appears to be blocked, opening the port in the firewall, as detailed above, is a common way to resolve this issue. Remember, opening ports can create security risks by potentially exposing services running on your system to the internet.

Here are some steps you can take to handle the situation professionally: 1. **Stay Neutral:** First and foremost, if you are not involved, it\'s essential to remain neutral. Avoid taking sides or making judgments based on limited information. 2. **Gather Information:** If the situation affects your work or if you are expected to be part of the resolution process, try to gather information from reliable sources. Understand the facts before you make any decisions or take any action. 3. **Listen Actively:** If colleagues are discussing the situation with you, listen actively to what they are saying. This shows respect for their perspective and may also provide you with a better understanding of the situation. 4. **Respect Privacy:** Be mindful of confidentiality and privacy. Some matters might be sensitive and not meant for broader discussion. It\'s important to respect the privacy of those involved and not spread information unnecessarily. 5. **Offer Support:** If someone involved in the situation approaches you for support or advice, offer to help to the extent that you can without compromising your neutrality or involving yourself too deeply. 6. **Redirect to Appropriate Parties:** If the situation is serious or outside your scope of understanding or authority, suggest that those involved seek help from appropriate sources, such as HR, a manager, or another relevant individual or department within the organization. 7. **Focus on Your Responsibilities:** Keep your focus on your own tasks and responsibilities. Getting entangled in office politics or conflicts can be distracting and detrimental to your work. 8. **Escalate if Necessary:** If the situation seems to be impacting the workplace environment or if there is improper conduct involved, it might need to be escalated to a higher level of authority within the organization. 9. **Reflect on Impact:** Consider if and how the situation may indirectly affect your work or team dynamics. Proactively addressing potential impacts can help to minimize any negative consequences. 10. **Practice Discretion:** Be discreet in your conversations and communications regarding the situation, especially if it is a sensitive matter. 11. **Stay Professional:** No matter what the situation or your role in it (or lack thereof), maintaining a professional demeanor is crucial. It\'s important to remember that every situation is unique and may require a tailored approach.

If you need me, I’ll be at my desk.” 3. **Seek Clarification:** If you feel that you should have been included in the meeting due to the relevance to your work, wait until the meeting is finished, and then approach one of the meeting organizers to clarify your role and whether you should have been involved. 4. **Discreet Inquiry:** Should you overhear something during the inadvertent encounter that you feel affects your responsibilities or projects, it\'s appropriate to discretely inquire with your direct supervisor or the meeting organizer afterward to ensure you are informed about any decisions or information that may affect your work. 5. **Reschedule Your Space:** If the meeting is taking place in a space you had reserved or typically use, it’s professional to find an alternative space for yourself while making a mental note to reiterate booking protocols to prevent such conflicts in the future. 6. **Use the Opportunity:** If the meeting’s occurrence makes you realize that a similar meeting relevant to your role should occur, take this opportunity to suggest the idea to your supervisor or the appropriate colleague. 7. **Reflect on Communication:** Use this as an opportunity to reflect on internal communication within your organization. If you often find yourself out of the loop, it may be worth discussing with your manager or HR about improving communication channels and information sharing. 8. **Note for Future Instances:** Record this event if it seems to be part of a pattern of exclusion that is affecting your ability to carry out your role effectively. If such incidents continue, you may need to have a conversation with your supervisor about ensuring you are included in relevant future discussions. Remember, handling such situations with professionalism and discretion is key. It’s important not to jump to conclusions or disrupt the meeting but to manage the situation calmly and gracefully."},{"prompt":"How to handle a work or activity when you are not part of it or nether you are aware of it in office ?","completion":"If you find yourself in a situation at work where an activity or project is ongoing but you are neither involved nor aware of the details, here are some steps you can take to handle the situation appropriately: 1. **Assess the Situation**: Determine why you\'re not involved. Is it because it\'s not relevant to your role, or was there an oversight? Understanding the reason can guide your next steps. 2. **Gather Information**: If you believe you should be informed or involved, try to get some basic information. You can ask colleagues who are involved or directly approach the managers handling the project. This can be done in an informal manner, like a casual conversation during a break or more formally by scheduling a meeting. 3. **Communicate**: Reach out to your supervisor or the project leader to express your interest or concern. Be polite and express your willingness to contribute or your need to understand how the project may impact your work. 4. **Offer Support**: If after getting more information, you feel that your skills could be beneficial to the project, offer your assistance. Identify specific ways you can contribute and make your case to the project leader. 5. **Respect Boundaries**: If the project doesn\'t concern your role or department, be respectful of that boundary. Offer help if needed but don\'t insist on being included if it\'s not appropriate. 6. **Request Regular Updates**: If the project does affect your role or department but you\'re not directly involved, you might request that the team provides regular updates. This can be part of team meetings or through email communications. 7. **Maintain Professionalism**: Even if you feel left out, it\'s important to stay professional. Don\'t let your feelings of exclusion negatively impact your work or your relationships with co-workers. 8. **Learn from the Experience**: Use this as an opportunity to learn more about how projects are assigned and managed in your office. If needed, have a discussion with your supervisor about your role and how you can be considered for future projects. 9. **Stay Informed**: Even if you\'re not involved, keeping a general awareness of what\'s going on in your office can help you stay in the loop and may prevent similar situations in the future. 10. **Continue with Your Responsibilities**: Focus on your current responsibilities and continue to perform well in your role. Building a reputation for excellence can increase your chances of being considered for future opportunities. Remember that not being part of every project or activity is normal in most workplaces. Resources and attention need to be distributed effectively, and not all employees will be involved in all initiatives. However, clarifying expectations and expressing a willingness to be involved in future projects can help you become more integrated into various aspects of your workplace."},{"prompt":"Fix grammar:Poke Bay serenity.","completion":"To correct the grammar, you might want to specify what aspect of Poke Bay\'s serenity you are talking about and turn it into a complete sentence.

Here\'s how you can approach these meetings even when you feel there\'s not much to discuss: 1. **Agenda Planning**: Create a structured agenda with slots for different types of discussions. Share the agenda with team members ahead of the meeting so they have time to prepare. 2. **Project Updates**: Provide brief updates on current projects, progress, any upcoming deadlines, or milestones achieved. If you\'re not leading any projects, consider inviting team members to give updates on their work. 3. **Educational Segment**: Introduce a short knowledge-sharing segment where a team member (or yourself) presents on a relevant topic, new technology, or industry trends. Rotate the presenter role each week to keep things varied. 4. **Process Improvements**: Discuss any issues that have arisen during the past week and brainstorm potential solutions. Encourage team members to share their ideas for workflow or process improvements. 5. **Feedback and Q&A**: Allow time for team members to ask questions or bring up any concerns. Encourage open communication and provide feedback where appropriate. 6. **Training and Development**: Use part of the meeting for training. Discuss opportunities for professional development, possible courses, webinars, or workshops that might be of interest. 7. **Team Building**: Incorporate a short team-building activity to strengthen relationships among team members. 8. **Planning and Goals**: Review goals for the upcoming week(s), assign responsibilities, or set new objectives. 9. **Guest Speakers**: Occasionally invite someone from another department or an outside expert to speak on relevant issues or to provide new insights. 10. **Recognition**: Take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate successes or to give recognition to individuals or the team for their efforts and achievements. 11. **Follow-Up Actions**: Conclude each meeting with clear action items, who is responsible for them, and the deadline. Remember to always keep the meetings as concise as possible. If there\'s no substantial content to discuss during a particular week, it\'s better to have a shorter meeting that respects everyone\'s time rather than stretching it unnecessarily. Lastly, periodically solicit feedback about the meetings themselves: Are they helpful? What could be improved? This will help ensure the meetings are productive and fulfilling their intended purpose. If it turns out that weekly meetings are too frequent, then discuss with your boss the possibility of adjusting the frequency to better match the needs of the team."},{"prompt":"give me some thing that i can use every week.","completion":"Certainly! To ensure that you have a recurring structure that can be used every week, here\'s an outline that you can adapt to fit almost any meeting. The goal is to create a repeatable format that still allows for variation from week to week: # Weekly Meeting Outline: 1. Opening (5 minutes) - Welcome and brief icebreaker or positive note (e.g., sharing a small win or expressing gratitude). 2. Project Status Update (10-15 minutes) - Go around the room (or virtual space) and have each team member provide a quick update on their current projects. - Highlight key accomplishments from the past week. 3. Focus Topic (10-20 minutes) - Each week, introduce a focus topic for a brief discussion or presentation, which might include: - Industry news and how it affects your work. - A skill-sharing session where a team member teaches a small lesson. - Customer or client feedback and what you can learn from it. - A spotlight on a specific project with deeper insights. 4.

Recognition (5 minutes) - Acknowledge outstanding work or milestones reached by individual team members. 8. Upcoming Week (5-10 minutes) - Outline the objectives for the coming week. - Assign tasks or address resource needs. 9. Feedback on Meeting (5 minutes) - Quick feedback loop on the meeting itself (what worked, what could be better). 10. Closing (5 minutes) - Summarize key action items and owners. - Thank everyone for their participation. Tools to Enhance Weekly Meetings: - **Meeting Notes Document**: Keep a shared document where you record summaries of each meeting, action items, and who is responsible for what. - **Rotating Roles**: Alternate roles such as note-taker, timekeeper, or presenter to keep everyone engaged. - **Reminders**: Set up automated reminders for action items or deadlines that come out of the meeting. To prevent the meetings from becoming monotonous, be flexible and open to adjusting the structure as needed, and keep an eye out for new topics or team concerns that can be incorporated into the discussion. Regularly invite feedback from the team to see which parts of the meeting they find most and least valuable, and tailor your approach accordingly. Finally, if you truly find there\'s not enough content or need for a weekly meeting, bring this concern to your boss and suggest an alternative meeting cadence or format that may be more effective."},{"prompt":"I dont have any project i do only one activity and that is QA for billed invoices,","completion":"If your primary activity is quality assurance for billed invoices and you don\'t oversee a variety of projects, it\'s still possible to conduct useful weekly meetings, though the focus will be more specialized.

The relationship between genotype and phenotype is complex, and involves the dynamic interaction of genes, and the proteins they encode, with myriad environmental stimuli.The Essence of Molecular Biology The genetic information on which the phenotype is built is contained in every cell in the form of DNA. Replication is the process by which DNA is duplicated. This process is undertaken prior to cell division to ensure that all daughter cells contain the same genetic information as the parent cell. The information in DNA is transmitted to RNA via a process called transcription . RNA synthesizes protein through the process of translation, which largely controls the appearance and function (i.e., the phenotype) of cells and organisms.Lecture’s Objectives 1. Define cell cycle. 2. List the phases of the cell cycle. 3. Describe the molecular events taking place during various phases of a cell cycle. 4. Explain how the cell cycle is regulated. 5. Correlate the disturbances in cell cycle regulation with cancer. 6. Define apoptosis. 7. Explain the significance of apoptosis. 8. Describe the pathways involved of the process of apoptosis.What is the cell cycle? Definition A cell cycle is a series of events that takes place in a cell as it grows and divides. A cell spends most of its time in what is called interphase, and during this time it grows, replicates its chromosomes, and prepares for cell division. The cell then leaves interphase, undergoes mitosis, and completes its division. The resulting cells, known as daughter cells, each enter their own interphase and begin a new round of the cell cycle.Phases of the cell cycle • Successive phases of progression of a cell through its cycle of replication are defined with reference to DNA synthesis and cellular division. 1- DNA synthesis occurs only during a limited period of the cell cycle, which is the S- phase .2- The cell-division stage or M phase comprising nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). 3- First gap phase (G 1 ) which occurs following the M phase. 4- Second gap phase (G 2 ) which separates the S-phase from the M phase. • Although initially regarded as periods of inactivity, it is now recognized that these gap phases represent periods when critical processes occur, preparing the cells for DNA synthesis and mitosis.Phases of the cell cycle• After cell division (mitosis), individual daughter cells may re-enter G 1 to undergo further division if appropriate stimuli are present. • Alternatively, they may leave the cycle and become quiescent or resting cells — a state often labelled as G 0 (resting phase). • Entry to G 0 may be associated with a process of terminal differentiation , with loss of potential for further division and death at the end of the lifetime of the cell; this occurs in permanent cells, such as neurons. Other quiescent cells retain some ability to proliferate by reentering G 1 if appropriate stimuli are present.Schematic of the cell cycle. Outer ring: I = Interphase, M = Mitosis; inner ring: M = Mitosis, G1 = Gap 1, G2 = Gap 2, S = Synthesis; not in ring: G0 = Gap 0/RestingDuration of the cell cycle • In mammals, different cell types divide at very different rates, with the cell cycle ranging from as little as 8 hours, in the case of gut epithelial cells, to 100 days or more, exemplified by hepatocytes in the normal adult liver. • However, the duration of the individual phases of the cycle is constant and independent of the rate of cell division. • The principal difference between rapidly dividing cells and those that divide slowly is the time spent temporarily in G 0 between divisions; some cells remain in the G 0 phase for days or even years between divisions, whilst others rapidly reenter G 1 after mitosis.Molecular events in the cell cycle • Cell division is a highly complex process and cells possess a molecular machinery to ensure its successful completion. • A number of internal checkpoints exist to ensure that one phase is complete before the next commences. This is vital to ensure that DNA replication has been performed accurately and that cells do not divide before DNA replication is complete. • The various proteins and enzymes that carry out DNA replication, mitotic spindle formation are typically only present and active during the appropriate phases of the cycle.Cell Cycle Checkpoints• The cell cycle is regulated by the activity of a family of proteins called cyclindependent kinases (CDKs). • CDKs activate their target proteins by phosphorylation. • The activity of CDKs is regulated by a second family of proteins, the cyclins . • Transitions from one phase of the cycle to the next are initiated by rises in the levels of specific cyclins. Regulation of the Cell Cycle• Cyclin D triggers the transition from G0 to G1 at the initiation of the cell cycle. This occurs when stimulated by growth factors. • Errors during DNA replication rises in the levels of certain proteins called the CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) which prevent CDKs from triggering the next phase of cell division until the issue is resolved. • If the cells fail to correct and repair these errors, they will typically initiate apoptosis rather than permit the generation of improper daughter cells.Disturbances in the cell cycle is associated with cancer • Damage to the genes that encode proteins involved in the regulation of cellcycle progression is seen in many cancers. • In normal cells, hundreds of genes control the process of cell division. Normal growth requires a balance between the activity of those genes that promote cell proliferation and those that suppress it. It also relies on the activities of genes that signal when damaged cells should undergo apoptosis.• Cells become cancerous after mutations accumulate in the various genes that control cell proliferation. • According to research findings from the Cancer Genome Project, most cancer cells possess 60 or more mutations. • Different kinds of cancers have different mutational signatures. However, scientific comparison of multiple tumor types has revealed that certain genes are mutated in cancer cells more often than others.• Growth-promoting genes, such as the gene for the signaling protein Ras, are among those most commonly mutated in cancer cells, becoming super-active and producing cells that are too strongly stimulated by growth receptors. • Other cancer-related mutations inactivate the genes that suppress cell proliferation or those that signal the need for apoptosis. These genes, known as tumor suppressor genes, normally function like brakes on proliferation, and both copies within a cell must be mutated in order for uncontrolled division to occur. For example, many cancer cells carry two mutant copies of the gene that codes for p53, the “guardian of the genome,” a multifunctional protein that normally senses DNA damage and acts as a transcription factor for checkpoint control genes.• Many of the drugs used in the treatment of cancer affect particular stages within the cell cycle. • These drugs inhibit the rapid division of cancer cells, but since they are administered systemically there is often inhibition of other rapidly dividing cells, such as the cells of the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. • Thus anemia, a bleeding tendency and suppression of immunity may be clinically important side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Regulatory proteins of the cell cycle are targets for anticancer drugsTherapeutic interruption of the cell cycleApoptosis Definition Physiological cell death. Apoptosis is a physiological cellular process in which a defined and programmed sequence of intracellular events leads to the removal of a cell without the release of products harmful to surrounding cells.Significance of Apoptosis • The coexistence of apoptosis alongside mitosis within a cell population ensures a continuous renewal of cells, rendering a tissue more adaptable to environmental demands than one in which the cell population is static. • It is an energy-dependent, biochemically specific mode of cell death characterized by the enzymatic digestion of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, and the phagocytosis of the resultant breakdown products whilst still retained within the cell membrane.• p53 is a multifunctional protein which induces cell cycle arrest and initiates DNA damage repair. However, if this is unsuccessful, p53 can induce apoptosis via activation of proapoptotic members• The nucleus shrinks (pyknosis) and fragments (karyorrhexis). The cell shrinks, retaining an intact plasma membrane, but alteration of this membrane rapidly induces phagocytosis. • Dead cells not phagocytosed fragment into smaller membranebound apoptotic bodies. • There is no inflammatory reaction to apoptotic cells, probably because the cell membrane is intact","completion":"Given the complexity and the depth of the topic provided, creating 30 multiple-choice questions with model answers to cover all the different aspects of the information you\'ve shared would be extensive.

Describe the pathways involved of the process of apoptosis.What is the cell cycle? Definition A cell cycle is a series of events that takes place in a cell as it grows and divides. A cell spends most of its time in what is called interphase, and during this time it grows, replicates its chromosomes, and prepares for cell division. The cell then leaves interphase, undergoes mitosis, and completes its division. The resulting cells, known as daughter cells, each enter their own interphase and begin a new round of the cell cycle.Phases of the cell cycle • Successive phases of progression of a cell through its cycle of replication are defined with reference to DNA synthesis and cellular division. 1- DNA synthesis occurs only during a limited period of the cell cycle, which is the S- phase .2- The cell-division stage or M phase comprising nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). 3- First gap phase (G 1 ) which occurs following the M phase. 4- Second gap phase (G 2 ) which separates the S-phase from the M phase. • Although initially regarded as periods of inactivity, it is now recognized that these gap phases represent periods when critical processes occur, preparing the cells for DNA synthesis and mitosis.Phases of the cell cycle• After cell division (mitosis), individual daughter cells may re-enter G 1 to undergo further division if appropriate stimuli are present. • Alternatively, they may leave the cycle and become quiescent or resting cells — a state often labelled as G 0 (resting phase). • Entry to G 0 may be associated with a process of terminal differentiation , with loss of potential for further division and death at the end of the lifetime of the cell; this occurs in permanent cells, such as neurons. Other quiescent cells retain some ability to proliferate by reentering G 1 if appropriate stimuli are present.Schematic of the cell cycle. Outer ring: I = Interphase, M = Mitosis; inner ring: M = Mitosis, G1 = Gap 1, G2 = Gap 2, S = Synthesis; not in ring: G0 = Gap 0/RestingDuration of the cell cycle • In mammals, different cell types divide at very different rates, with the cell cycle ranging from as little as 8 hours, in the case of gut epithelial cells, to 100 days or more, exemplified by hepatocytes in the normal adult liver. • However, the duration of the individual phases of the cycle is constant and independent of the rate of cell division. • The principal difference between rapidly dividing cells and those that divide slowly is the time spent temporarily in G 0 between divisions; some cells remain in the G 0 phase for days or even years between divisions, whilst others rapidly reenter G 1 after mitosis.Molecular events in the cell cycle • Cell division is a highly complex process and cells possess a molecular machinery to ensure its successful completion. • A number of internal checkpoints exist to ensure that one phase is complete before the next commences. This is vital to ensure that DNA replication has been performed accurately and that cells do not divide before DNA replication is complete. • The various proteins and enzymes that carry out DNA replication, mitotic spindle formation are typically only present and active during the appropriate phases of the cycle.Cell Cycle Checkpoints• The cell cycle is regulated by the activity of a family of proteins called cyclindependent kinases (CDKs). • CDKs activate their target proteins by phosphorylation. • The activity of CDKs is regulated by a second family of proteins, the cyclins . • Transitions from one phase of the cycle to the next are initiated by rises in the levels of specific cyclins. Regulation of the Cell Cycle• Cyclin D triggers the transition from G0 to G1 at the initiation of the cell cycle. This occurs when stimulated by growth factors. • Errors during DNA replication rises in the levels of certain proteins called the CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) which prevent CDKs from triggering the next phase of cell division until the issue is resolved. • If the cells fail to correct and repair these errors, they will typically initiate apoptosis rather than permit the generation of improper daughter cells.Disturbances in the cell cycle is associated with cancer • Damage to the genes that encode proteins involved in the regulation of cellcycle progression is seen in many cancers. • In normal cells, hundreds of genes control the process of cell division. Normal growth requires a balance between the activity of those genes that promote cell proliferation and those that suppress it. It also relies on the activities of genes that signal when damaged cells should undergo apoptosis.• Cells become cancerous after mutations accumulate in the various genes that control cell proliferation. • According to research findings from the Cancer Genome Project, most cancer cells possess 60 or more mutations. • Different kinds of cancers have different mutational signatures. However, scientific comparison of multiple tumor types has revealed that certain genes are mutated in cancer cells more often than others.• Growth-promoting genes, such as the gene for the signaling protein Ras, are among those most commonly mutated in cancer cells, becoming super-active and producing cells that are too strongly stimulated by growth receptors. • Other cancer-related mutations inactivate the genes that suppress cell proliferation or those that signal the need for apoptosis. These genes, known as tumor suppressor genes, normally function like brakes on proliferation, and both copies within a cell must be mutated in order for uncontrolled division to occur. For example, many cancer cells carry two mutant copies of the gene that codes for p53, the “guardian of the genome,” a multifunctional protein that normally senses DNA damage and acts as a transcription factor for checkpoint control genes.• Many of the drugs used in the treatment of cancer affect particular stages within the cell cycle. • These drugs inhibit the rapid division of cancer cells, but since they are administered systemically there is often inhibition of other rapidly dividing cells, such as the cells of the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. • Thus anemia, a bleeding tendency and suppression of immunity may be clinically important side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Regulatory proteins of the cell cycle are targets for anticancer drugsTherapeutic interruption of the cell cycleApoptosis Definition Physiological cell death. Apoptosis is a physiological cellular process in which a defined and programmed sequence of intracellular events leads to the removal of a cell without the release of products harmful to surrounding cells.Significance of Apoptosis • The coexistence of apoptosis alongside mitosis within a cell population ensures a continuous renewal of cells, rendering a tissue more adaptable to environmental demands than one in which the cell population is static. • It is an energy-dependent, biochemically specific mode of cell death characterized by the enzymatic digestion of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, and the phagocytosis of the resultant breakdown products whilst still retained within the cell membrane.• p53 is a multifunctional protein which induces cell cycle arrest and initiates DNA damage repair. However, if this is unsuccessful, p53 can induce apoptosis via activation of proapoptotic members• The nucleus shrinks (pyknosis) and fragments (karyorrhexis). The cell shrinks, retaining an intact plasma membrane, but alteration of this membrane rapidly induces phagocytosis. • Dead cells not phagocytosed fragment into smaller membranebound apoptotic bodies. • There is no inflammatory reaction to apoptotic cells, probably because the cell membrane is intact","completion":"Creating 30 multiple choice questions covering the extensive topics described would be quite detailed and beyond the capacity of a single response, but I can give you an example of some questions, and I suggest breaking down the content into smaller units to manage the workload. 1.

Aqui estão alguns dos principais motivos: 1. Degradação da mídia: O processo de gravação em um CD-R envolve mudanças químicas no corante da camada gravável. Ao longo do tempo, esse corante pode se degradar, especialmente se exposto a condições extremas de temperatura, umidade ou luz solar direta. Isso pode levar à perda de dados ou falha na leitura do disco. 2. Arranhões e danos físicos: A superfície do CD pode ser facilmente arranhada ou danificada, especialmente se não for manipulada ou armazenada corretamente. Arranhões na superfície de leitura podem impedir que o laser do leitor de CD leia os dados corretamente ou até mesmo tornar o CD completamente ilegível. 3. Oxidação: A camada reflexiva do CD, que geralmente é feita de alumínio, pode oxidar com o tempo. Isso pode ocorrer devido a pequenas falhas na camada protetora que recobre essa superfície metalizada. Quando é exposta ao ar, essa camada pode começar a se oxidar, o que interfere na refletividade do disco e, portanto, na sua capacidade de ser lido por um laser. 4. Exposição a produtos químicos: Alguns tipos de tintas, adesivos, solventes e outros produtos químicos podem reagir com as camadas de um CD-R, levando à deterioração da mídia. 5. Degradabilidade da cola: Em alguns CDs, a cola usada para unir as camadas do disco pode sofrer degradação, o que pode causar separação das camadas e falha na mídia. 6. Erros de gravação ou de finalização: Anomalias durante o processo de gravação ou falhas para finalizar corretamente um CD podem levar a erros de leitura, tornando-o parcial ou completamente inacessível. 7. Má qualidade da mídia: CDs-R de baixa qualidade estão mais suscetíveis à deterioração e falhas devido à utilização de materiais inferiores tanto na camada gravável quanto na camada reflexiva. Para aumentar a durabilidade de um CD gravado, é aconselhável armazenar os discos em locais frescos, secos e livres de luz direta do sol, além de manuseá-los com cuidado e utilizar capas ou estojos de proteção."},{"prompt":"I want you to make SOP for \\"How to take office meetings more effectively?\\"","completion":"Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Conducting Effective Office Meetings Purpose: The purpose of this SOP is to establish and define the procedures and guidelines for conducting effective office meetings that are productive, time-efficient, and result in clear action items and decisions.

Покажите результаты изменения предоставления прав собственности в модели Эджуорта: Так как модель Эджуорта — это абстрактная экономическая модель, реальное визуальное представление изменений в правах собственности невозможно предоставить без специфических данных и контекста. Вместо этого я могу представить концептуальное описание изменения с помощью коробки Эджуорта, которая используется для анализа различных распределений ресурсов между двумя агентами. В коробке длина и ширина отражают всю доступность двух различных благ. Каждый угол представляет полное владение одним из благ одним из агентов. Кривые безразличия показывают комбинации благ, приносящие одинаковый уровень удовлетворения каждому агенту. При изменении прав собственности начальная точка (угол), с которой агенты начинают торг, смещается. Например, если одному агенту предоставляется больше прав на одно из благ, его начальная точка будет ближе к соответствующему углу коробки, что увеличивает его начальные ресурсы по сравнению с другим агентом. Это смещение может выглядеть следующим образом: 1. Ранее, если оба агента имели равные права собственности, начальная точка могла находиться в центре коробки Эджуорта. 2. После изменения прав собственности, начальная точка смещается в сторону угла одного из агентов, что указывает на изменение в распределении ресурсов между ними. 3. Новое распределение ресурсов приведет к изменению формы и положения кривых безразличия, и возможно изменит положение точки равновесия, где кривые безразличия двух агентов будут касаться друг друга без возможности дальнейшего улучшения состояния хотя бы одного агента без ухудшения состояния другого.

Одним из часто встречающихся образов в сновидениях являются листья. В зависимости от культурных традиций и личных ассоциаций каждого человека, листья могут иметь различные трактовки. Они могут быть символом роста, жизни и перемен или вести к мыслям о временности и увядании. Когда мы видим зеленые листья во сне, это часто символизирует новый этап в жизни или новые начинания. Зелень связывают с жизненной энергией, силой и здоровьем. Если листья распускаются прямо на глазах, это может предвещать бурный рост и развитие личных проектов или карьеры. Опавшие листья, в свою очередь, могут стать символом чего-то уходящего из жизни. Это может быть знаком окончания какого-то периода, потери или приближения осеннего периода жизни, который связан с размышлениями и подведением итогов. Такие сны могут побуждать нас к размышлению о том, что пора отпускать старое, для того чтобы освободить пространство для новых возможностей. Если сновидец видит листья на деревьях в лесу, это может быть символом гармонии с природой и окружающим миром. Лесным зеленым убранством порой символизируют умиротворение и единение с внутренним «я». В таких снах кроется посыл к тому, чтобы быть в балансе и находить спокойствие. Видение листопада может предвещать период изменений и выпадения из привычного ритма жизни. Это может быть время, когда старые привычки, взгляды или связи будут отпадать, давая место новым. Листья различных цветов тоже имеют свои значения. Яркие осенние листья могут напоминать о красоте процесса изменений и о том, что даже завершение какого-то этапа может быть красивым. Засохшие и увядающие листья предостерегают о возможном застое и потребности в оживлении какой-то сферы жизни. Сон о листьях, которые несет ветер, может быть призывом к гибкости и способности идти на компромиссы, а также указанием на непостоянство и переменчивость окружающих обстоятельств. Таким образом, листья во сне выступают в качестве символов, смысл которых может варьироваться в зависимости от контекста сновидения, их цвета, состояния и других сопутствующих деталей. Важно вспомнить и проанализировать все элементы сна, чтобы понять, какое именно послание несет вам ваш подсознательный ум. Сны с листьями могут быть напоминанием о прохождении через циклы жизни, об изменении, росте и возможности оставлять позади то, что больше не служит нашим целям."},{"prompt":"Оформи красиво в html и начни сразу с тега <p>","completion":"```html <p>Сны могут служить зеркалом нашего внутреннего мира, отображая скрытые желания, страхи и предчувствия.

They filter your blood and get rid of waste products. When doctors talk about renal function, they\'re usually referring to how well your kidneys are doing their job. One way to measure this is by looking at your Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which estimates how much blood your kidneys are filtering every minute. Now, your kidneys are pretty amazing and they have a lot of backup power – so much so that you can lose quite a bit of their filtering ability without even noticing. It\'s only when your kidney function drops to less than 30% of what\'s considered normal that you might start feeling sick. This is because your kidneys have a high \\"reserve,\\" meaning they can still manage their essential functions even when they\'re not at full strength. Even when your kidneys aren\'t functioning at more than 30% of their usual capacity, you might not feel any symptoms. But, doctors can start to see signs of kidney strain in your blood tests. If the kidney function gets worse, here are some issues you might experience, particularly due to the buildup of waste products in the body – we call this \\"uremic toxins\\": 1. **Mouth problems:** You might notice your breath smells a bit like ammonia and that there\'s a bad taste in your mouth. Your mouth could become sore, you might experience bleeding more easily due to platelet dysfunction (platelets help your blood to clot), and your mouth and tongue might feel very dry. 2. **Esophagus:** You could develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which means stomach acid is irritating the tube that connects your mouth and your stomach, leading to heartburn and discomfort. 3. **Diaphragm:** This is the muscle that helps you breathe. Uremic toxins can cause you to get hiccups. 4. **Stomach problems:** You might have gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. This can cause bleeding and even lead to the stomach wall breaking down (perforation). 5. **Liver issues:** If you are receiving dialysis (a treatment for kidney failure), you might be at risk of hepatitis, which is an inflammation of the liver. 6. **Intestinal issues:** Constipation can be an issue, and in later stages, you might develop a severe form of diarrhea due to urea (a waste product) depositing in the colon. The takeaway here is that kidney problems can affect your body in a lot of ways because the kidneys\' job – flushing out toxins – is super important. And it\'s also why issues might not be obvious until a significant amount of kidney function is lost."},{"prompt":"test me on this : Symptoms typically do not manifest until renal function (GFR) declines to 30% of normal due to the high reserve of the kidneys. **More than 30% of normal GFR:** - Biochemical evidence of renal failure may be observed, but patients are generally still asymptomatic. - **1.

Here are the answers based on the information provided regarding symptoms associated with declining kidney function: 1. Symptoms typically do not manifest until renal function declines to **30% of normal** due to the high reserve capacity of the kidneys. 2. Patients with kidney issues might notice an **ammonia smell** with a bad taste in their mouth, which can be a symptom of uremia. 3. Patients may develop **GERD** (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), which is a condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). 4. The diaphragm can experience **hiccoughs (hiccups)** due to the central effects of uremic toxins such as phenol. 5. Gastritis related to kidney issues might present with **bleeding and the risk of stomach perforation**. 6. Hepatitis can be associated with kidney function issues due to complications that arise during **dialysis**, which is a treatment for severe kidney failure. 7. A potential late-stage symptom in the intestines, caused by uremic toxins, is **uremic dysentery**, which is severe irritation of the intestines leading to diarrhea, and it is due to urea deposition in the colon. 8. The common blood pressure condition in patients with reduced renal function is **hypertension** (high blood pressure), which occurs in about 80% of cases due to **sodium (Na) retention**. Hypotension (low blood pressure) can occur in about 20% of cases, often in sodium-losing patients. 9. **Uremic pericarditis**, which indicates inflammation of the heart\'s outer lining, may develop as a serious indicator of end-stage renal disease and is a sign that dialysis may be necessary. 10. **Arrhythmias** in patients with renal failure can be caused by **electrolyte disturbances**, especially abnormalities in potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels.

Её основное назначение - это работа с файлами и директориями в уже известных путях. Тем не менее, если вам уже известны буквы дисков, например C и E, вы можете легко создать пути к корню этих дисков, используя `std::filesystem::path`: ```cpp #include <filesystem> #include <iostream> int main() { std::filesystem::path path1 = \\"C:/\\"; std::filesystem::path path2 = \\"E:/\\"; // Проверка существования дисков if(std::filesystem::exists(path1)) { std::cout << \\"Диск C существует, путь: \\" << path1 << std::endl; } else { std::cout << \\"Диск C не найден.\\" << std::endl; } if(std::filesystem::exists(path2)) { std::cout << \\"Диск E существует, путь: \\" << path2 << std::endl; } else { std::cout << \\"Диск E не найден.\\" << std::endl; } return 0; } ``` Данный код создаст объекты `path1` и `path2`, представляющие собой пути к корням дисков C и E соответственно, и затем проверит, действительно ли эти диски существуют. Обратите внимание, что в Windows пути к дискам обычно заканчиваются на двоеточие и обратный слэш, `/` или ``. В примере выше используется `/`, но так как библиотека `std::filesystem` корректно обрабатывает оба типа слэшей, это не должно вызвать проблем в кросс-платформенных операциях. Также возможно, что в некоторых случаях вам может понадобиться код для определения путей ко всем доступным дискам на Windows, но для этого потребуются Windows API или системные вызовы, которые выходят за рамки стандартной библиотеки C++."},{"prompt":"В каких случаях стоит использовать unique_ptr, share_ptr, weak_ptr? c++","completion":"`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr` и `std::weak_ptr` являются умными указателями из стандартной библиотеки C++ и используются для управления динамически выделенной памятью. Каждый из этих типов имеет своё предназначение в зависимости от семантики владения ресурсом: 1. **`std::unique_ptr`** - это умный указатель, который обеспечивает исключительное (уникальное) владение ресурсом. Это означает, что в каждый момент времени только один `std::unique_ptr` может владеть данным ресурсом (выделенной памятью). Используйте `std::unique_ptr` когда: - Вам нужно гарантировать, что память будет освобождена, когда указатель выйдет из области видимости или будет удалён. - У вас есть ресурс, который должен принадлежать только одному владельцу, и вы хотите предотвратить его неявное копирование или передачу. - Вам нужен легковесный умный указатель без накладных расходов на подсчёт ссылок, которые есть у `std::shared_ptr`. 2. **`std::shared_ptr`** - это умный указатель, который обеспечивает совместное владение ресурсом. Несколько `std::shared_ptr` могут одновременно владеть одним и тем же ресурсом. Когда последний `std::shared_ptr`, владеющий ресурсом, уничтожается или отказывается от владения, ресурс освобождается. Используйте `std::shared_ptr` когда: - Вам нужно несколько владельцев одного и того же ресурса. - Вам нужно гарантировать, что ресурс не будет освобожден, пока хотя бы один владелец ещё жив. - Вы используете библиотеку или фреймворк, который требует использование `std::shared_ptr` (например, некоторые системы сообщений или задач). 3. **`std::weak_ptr`** - это умный указатель, который не владеет ресурсом, но может наблюдать за ним и доступ к которому может быть получен посредством `std::shared_ptr`. Это предотвращает образование циклических ссылок, которые могут препятствовать освобождению памяти при использовании `std::shared_ptr`. Используйте `std::weak_ptr` когда: - Вам нужно временно наблюдать за ресурсом или иметь к нему доступ без принятия ответственности за его существование. - Вы хотите избежать циклических ссылок, например, в структурах данных, где элементы взаимно ссылаются друг на друга. Всегда выбирайте подходящий умный указатель в зависимости от требований к владению и жизненному циклу объектов, который вы хотите обеспечить. Корректное использование умных указателей помогает предотвратить утечки памяти и делает код более безопасным и предсказуемым."},{"prompt":"vector<char>& get_alphabet() { vector<char> t = make_unique<vector<char>>; .... } Почему фрагмент кода не будет работать? И вообще нужно и можно ли выделять память динамически для контейнеров в c++","completion":"Фрагмент кода, который вы предоставили, содержит несколько ошибок, из-за которых он не будет работать: 1. Вы пытаетесь возвратить ссылку на локальный объект `vector<char>`. Локальный объект будет уничтожен по выходу из функции, и ссылка на него станет недействительной. Это приведет к неопределённому поведению, если попытаться использовать возвращаемую ссылку. 2. В вызове `make_unique<vector<char>>` отсутствуют круглые скобки `()`, необходимые для вызова конструктора. Кроме того, `std::make_unique` используется для создания `std::unique_ptr`, а не для прямого создания объектов. Чтобы исправить код, вы можете возвратить объект-контейнер напрямую (т.е., по значению), что в современных компиляторах должно обеспечить перемещение контейнера вместо копирования благодаря Return Value Optimization (RVO) или правилу перемещения при возврате: ```cpp #include <vector> std::vector<char> get_alphabet() { std::vector<char> t; // Создаем вектор на стеке. // Заполнение вектора буквами алфавита... // t.emplace_back(\'a\'); // Например так return t; // Возвращает вектор по значению } ``` Этот код будет эффективен в плане производительности и корректен, поскольку возвращается объект `vector` по значению, и современные компиляторы C++ умеют оптимизировать такое возвращение, чтобы не происходило лишнего копирования объекта. Относительно второго вопроса: в общем случае нет необходимости динамически выделять память для стандартных контейнеров STL, таких как `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map` и т. д., так как они уже самостоятельно управляют своей памятью в куче. Эксплицитное создание контейнера при помощи `std::make_unique` или `new` может быть полезно в специфических ситуациях, когда требуется долгосрочное владение данными или управление временем жизни объекта вручную, но это относительно редкое требование."},{"prompt":"Как инициализировать vector<char> на куче в C++: vector<char>* t =...","completion":"Если вы хотите инициализировать `std::vector<char>` на куче в C++, вы можете воспользоваться оператором `new`, который создаст объект в динамической памяти (на куче) и вернёт указатель на него: ```cpp #include <vector> int main() { std::vector<char>* t = new std::vector<char>; // теперь можно использовать вектор через указатель t->push_back(\'a\'); t->push_back(\'b\'); t->push_back(\'c\'); // ... // не забудьте освободить память после использования delete t; } ``` Тем не менее, служебные указатели (в частности, голые указатели) для динамического выделения памяти под стандартные контейнеры, как правило, не рекомендуются, поскольку они требуют ручного управления памятью (`delete`) и повышают риск утечек памяти и других ошибок, связанных с ресурсами. Вместо этого часто предпочтительнее использовать умные указатели, такие как `std::unique_ptr` или `std::shared_ptr`, которые автоматически освободят память при удалении. Пример с `std::unique_ptr`: ```cpp #include <vector> #include <memory> int main() { std::unique_ptr<std::vector<char>> t = std::make_unique<std::vector<char>>(); t->push_back(\'a\'); t->push_back(\'b\'); t->push_back(\'c\'); // ... // Память будет автоматически освобождена, когда unique_ptr уничтожится // Нет необходимости в явном вызове delete } ``` Оператор `new` и умные указатели полезны, если вам действительно необходимо контролировать время жизни объекта в динамической памяти. Однако в большинстве случаев, когда речь идёт о стандартных контейнерах, таких как `std::vector`, им следует позволить управлять своей внутренней памятью автоматически, просто создавая контейнер на стеке."},{"prompt":"Почему строчка с доступом по [] вызывает ошибку unique_ptr<vector<char>> get_alphabet() //better than ref on pointer mb UB? cause copy pointer situation exists { unique_ptr<vector<char>> v = make_unique<vector<char>>(); v.get()->reserve(30); //cout << v << endl; //cout << v.use_count() << endl; before share_ptr for (int i = 65; ; i++) { if (i > 91) break; v.get()->push_back(static_cast<char>(i)); //int to char explicit cout << v.get()[0] << endl; } return v; }","completion":"Ваш фрагмент кода имеет несколько проблем, но давайте сфокусируемся на ошибке, связанной с вызовом оператора `[]` для доступа к элементам вектора через `std::unique_ptr`. Ошибка происходит в следующей части кода: ```cpp cout << v.get()[0] << endl; ``` `std::unique_ptr::get()` возвращает обычный указатель на управляемый объект. В данном случае это `vector<char>*`. Когда вы пытаетесь использовать оператор `[]` с результатом метода `get()`, вы на самом деле пытаетесь применить его к указателю на `std::vector` (а не к элементам самого вектора), что неправильно и приводит к ошибке. Для доступа к элементам вектора, на который указывает `std::unique_ptr`, вам следует использовать оператор `->`, чтобы вызвать методы объекта `std::vector`, включая оператор `[]`, над самим вектором. Вот правильно написанная строчка: ```cpp cout << (*v)[0] << endl; // Разыменовываем unique_ptr и получаем доступ к первому элементу вектора // или cout << v->at(0) << endl; // Используем метод at для доступа к элементу вектора с проверкой границ ``` Отметим, что если вы используете `push_back`, вам не обязательно заранее резервировать память с помощью `reserve`, так как `push_back` сам может увеличить вместимость вектора, когда это необходимо. Однако если вы заранее знаете примерное количество элементов, которые будете добавлять, `reserve` может улучшить производительность, минимизируя количество реаллокаций. Теперь весь исправленный код будет выглядеть так: ```cpp #include <iostream> #include <memory> #include <vector> using namespace std; unique_ptr<vector<char>> get_alphabet() { unique_ptr<vector<char>> v = make_unique<vector<char>>(); // v->reserve(30); // Опционально: запись можно упустить for (char i = \'A\'; i <= \'Z\'; ++i) { v->push_back(i); //int to char no need explicit cast } // Для демонстрации доступа к элементам вектора через unique_ptr for (size_t i = 0; i < v->size(); ++i) { cout << (*v)[i] << endl; } return v; } int main() { auto alphabet = get_alphabet(); // ... использование alphabet } ``` Помните, что при возврате `std::unique_ptr` из функции не произойдет копирования владения, благодаря механизму перемещения в C++. Это обеспечивает безопасную передачу владения объектом без утечек памяти."},{"prompt":"Корректно ли написана данная функция на C++ или стоит что-тол исправить? unique_ptr<vector<char>> get_alphabet() //better than ref on pointer mb UB? cause copy pointer situation exists { unique_ptr<vector<char>> v = make_unique<vector<char>>(); v.get()->reserve(30); //cout << v << endl; //cout << v.use_count() << endl; before share_ptr for (int i = 65; ; i++) { if (i > 90) break; v.get()->push_back(static_cast<char>(i)); //int to char explicit cout << (*v.get())[i-65] << endl; // (*real_ptr) разименование и уже можно [] } return v; }","completion":"Функция `get_alphabet`, которую вы определили, выглядит практически корректной, но есть несколько аспектов, которые можно улучшить или упростить для повышения читаемости и соблюдения лучших практик в C++. 1. Сначала, `v.get()->reserve(30);`: метод `get()` возвращает обычный указатель на объект. Вызов `get()` излишен, поскольку у `unique_ptr` есть перегруженный оператор `->`, позволяющий вызывать методы напрямую: ```cpp v->reserve(30); ``` 2. В цикле `for` вы используете магическое число `65`, которое соответствует символу `\'A\'` в ASCII. Чтобы улучшить понимание кода, вы можете использовать символьный литерал напрямую: ```cpp for (char ch = \'A\'; ch <= \'Z\'; ++ch) { v->push_back(ch); } ``` Таким образом, явное приведение типа `static_cast<char>(i)` больше не требуется, и код становится более понятным. 3. Вывод элемента вектора `(v.get())[i-65]` можно упростить, разыменовав `unique_ptr`, как было показано ранее: ```cpp cout << (*v)[i - \'A\'] << endl; ``` 4. Цикл `for` нуждается в условии продолжения работы. Поэтому его условие можно включить напрямую в определение цикла вместо использования бесконечного цикла с `break`. 5. Комментарии о `shared_ptr` нужно удалить, они создают путаницу, так как в контексте функции используются `unique_ptr`.

Функция возвращает `unique_ptr` на вектор, что позволяет безопасно передать владение данными вызывающему коду.

Не хватает `#include`, которые необходимы для использования `std::vector`, `std::unique_ptr`, `std::make_unique` и `std::filesystem::path`. 2. В строке `path mask = \\":/\\";` создаётся переменная `mask`, которая не используется в дальнейшем. Вы наверно хотели использовать этот `mask` при формировании пути диска `path t = (a + \\":/\\");`. 3. Следует использовать оператор `std::string::operator+`, чтобы присоединить `\\":\\"` и `\\"/\\"` к символу диска (который должен быть преобразован в строку). 4. При создании объекта `std::filesystem::path`, его нужно инициализировать корректной строкой представления пути, а не выражением `(a + \\":/\\")`, которое приведет к сложению `char` и `const char[]`, что не корректно. 5. Все заинклуденные и используемые пространства имён нужно определить в начале файла.

Для каждого символа из `alphabet` создается путь и проверяется на существование. Если путь существует, он добавляется в вектор `unique_ptr<vector<path>>`. Теперь функция `get_disks` должна работать корректно в предположении, что в `alphabet` передаются правильные символы дисков."},{"prompt":"У меня установлена Windows 10, компилируя в MSVC в выводе консоли я получаю 8 версию ОС, почему так, код: const char* GetOsVersionName() { if (IsWindows10OrGreater()) { return \\"10\\"; } if (IsWindows8Point1OrGreater()) { return \\"8.1\\"; } if (IsWindows8OrGreater()) { return \\"8\\"; } if (IsWindows7OrGreater()) { return \\"7\\"; } if (IsWindowsVistaOrGreater()) { return \\"Vista\\"; } if (IsWindowsXPOrGreater()) { return \\"XP\\"; } return \\"Unknown\\"; } void PrintVersion3rdWay() { const char* osVersionName = GetOsVersionName(); std::printf(\\"Running under Windows %sn\\", osVersionName); }","completion":"Возможность определения версии Windows зависит от информации, которую разработчик указывает в манифесте приложения.

Некоторые системные папки в Windows могут требовать повышенных привилегий для доступа. В стандартной библиотеке `std::filesystem` есть два типа итераторов: `directory_iterator` и `recursive_directory_iterator`. Последний по умолчанию выбрасывает исключение при возникновении ошибок обхода, например, из-за отсутствия прав доступа. Чтобы функция обхода работала без ошибок, вы можете отловить исключения и продолжить обход, игнорируя папки, к которым нет доступа. Вот изменённая версия вашего кода, обрабатывающая возможные исключения: ```cpp #include <iostream> #include <filesystem> namespace fs = std::filesystem; void recursive_traversal(const fs::path& root) { std::cout << root << \\" current root\\" << std::endl; if (!fs::exists(root) || !fs::is_directory(root)) { std::cerr << \\"Error: Путь не существует или это не директория.\\" << std::endl; return; } fs::recursive_directory_iterator it(root), end; while (it != end) { // Вывод текущего пути std::cout << it->path() << std::endl; try { ++it; } catch (const std::filesystem::filesystem_error& e) { std::cerr << \\"Error: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; // Пропуск ошибочной папки и продолжение обхода it.disable_recursion_pending(); ++it; } } } int main() { // Замените на нужный вам путь fs::path root_path = \\"C:/\\"; // Вызываем функцию для рекурсивного вывода содержимого директории recursive_traversal(root_path); return 0; } ``` В этом коде, когда происходит ошибка файловой системы, вызывается обработчик исключений, который выводит информацию об ошибке, а затем прерывает рекурсивный обход текущей папки и продолжает со следующего элемента в `recursive_directory_iterator`. Также следует учитывать, что для доступа к защищённым системным папкам может потребоваться запуск вашего приложения от имени администратора (например, запуск через \\"Запустить от имени администратора\\" в контекстном меню или настройка манифеста для включения UAC (User Account Control) в Windows)."},{"prompt":"Данная функция всё ещё работает не корректно из-за мусорной корзины в папке C:","completion":"В операционной системе Windows, мусорная корзина (Recycle Bin) является специальной системной папкой, имеющей уникальную структуру и ограничения доступа. Обычно, при попытке программного доступа к этой папке и её содержимому через стандартные средства файловой системы может возникать исключение из-за отсутствия прав доступа или из-за особенностей её структуры. Если во время рекурсивного обхода директории программа сталкивается с такими системными папками и не может прочитать их содержимое, она может генерировать исключение типа `std::filesystem::filesystem_error`. Для решения этой проблемы вы можете использовать технику обработки исключений, как показано в предыдущем ответе, и пропускать папки, к которым нет доступа. Если проблема именно в мусорной корзине (или других системных папках), которую вы хотите исключить из процесса обхода, вы можете добавить проверку на такие папки и пропустить их: ```cpp #include <iostream> #include <filesystem> namespace fs = std::filesystem; void recursive_traversal(const fs::path& root) { std::cout << \\"Starting traversal from: \\" << root << std::endl; if (!fs::exists(root) || !fs::is_directory(root)) { std::cerr << \\"Error: Путь не существует или это не директория.\\" << std::endl; return; } fs::recursive_directory_iterator it(root), end; while (it != end) { try { const auto& entry = *it; const auto& path = entry.path(); // Пропустить специальные папки, такие как мусорная корзина if (path.filename() == \\"Recycle.Bin\\") { it.disable_recursion_pending(); ++it; continue; } // Вывести текущий путь std::cout << path << std::endl; ++it; } catch (const fs::filesystem_error& e) { std::cerr << \\"Error: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; // Пропустить текущую папку при ошибке и продолжить обход it.disable_recursion_pending(); ++it; } } } int main() { fs::path root_path = \\"C:/\\"; recursive_traversal(root_path); return 0; } ``` В этом коде перед выводом пути мы проверяем, не является ли текущий элемент итератора специальной системной папкой, например, мусорной корзиной, и если это так, мы пропускаем её. Обратите внимание, что название \\"Recycle.Bin\\" может отличаться в зависимости от версии Windows и настроек системы. Добавление оператора `continue` позволяет прервать текущую итерацию цикла, пропустить нежелательную папку и продолжить обход.

Descrivi il problema: A volte, i sintomi che noti possono indicare direttamente la causa del problema. Fammi sapere esattamente cosa sta succedendo. Ad esempio, se c\'è una perdita di potenza, rumori insoliti, spie del cruscotto accese, ecc. 2. Spie del cruscotto: Qualsiasi spia del cruscotto illuminata? Se hai una spia del motore (check engine light) accesa, un lettore OBD-II può essere collegato al veicolo per leggere i codici di errore memorizzati, i quali possono fornire indicazioni su dove sia il problema. 3. Circonstanze specifiche: Fa il problema si verifica sempre o solo sotto specifiche condizioni (freddo, caldo, durante l\'accelerazione, a velocità costante, ecc.)? 4.

Se l\'apertura del baule non funziona né con il keyless né con il telecomando ma non ci sono spie di avvertimento nel cruscotto, il problema potrebbe essere circoscritto al sistema di apertura del baule o ai dispositivi di accesso remoto. Un assorbimento di corrente di circa 2 ampere con la vettura spenta indica un chiaro problema di \\"drenaggio\\" della batteria, ovvero un consumo elettrico che persiste anche quando la vettura è spenta. Questo può portare a scaricare la batteria inaspettatamente. Ecco alcuni passaggi di diagnosi che potresti considerare: 1. Controlla la batteria e i collegamenti: Assicurati che la batteria sia in buone condizioni e che tutti i collegamenti, inclusi quelli della massa, siano puliti, fissati e liberi da corrosione. 2. Fusibili: Controlla il pannello dei fusibili per vedere se c\'è qualche fusibile legato al sistema di chiusura del baule che è bruciato o presenti malfunzionamenti. 3. Interruttore del baule: Il problema potrebbe originarsi dall\'interruttore del baule stesso. Spesso sono presenti sensori o interruttori che possono guastarsi e non rispondere ai comandi. 4. Sistema keyless e il telecomando: Se disponi di un secondo telecomando, prova ad usarlo per escludere un problema con il telecomando principale. Se il problema persiste con entrambi i telecomandi, potrebbe esserci un difetto nel ricevitore keyless o nel sistema di apertura centralizzato. 5. Relè e attuatori: Un relè guasto o un attuatore del baule (solenoide) potrebbe essere la causa dell\'inabilità di aprire il baule. Questi componenti sono spesso responsabili dell\'azione meccanica di sblocco. 6. Test del parasitario: Considera di eseguire un test di drenaggio della batteria. Disconnetti un terminale della batteria e collega un amperometro in serie per misurare l\'assorbimento di corrente. Successivamente, inizia a rimuovere fusibili uno per uno mentre monitori l\'amperometro. Quando l\'assorbimento di corrente cala improvvisamente, hai individuato il circuito che causa il drenaggio. Dopodiché, puoi concentrarti su quel circuito e ispezionare componenti specifici. Per procedere con una diagnosi più approfondita potrebbe essere necessario utilizzare strumenti diagnostici specifici o fare affidamento sull\'esperienza di un tecnico qualificato. Nel caso in cui non ti senti sicuro di procedere con queste verifiche o se i problemi persistono, il mio consiglio è di rivolgerti a un meccanico o a un\'officina autorizzata Renault per un controllo professionale."},{"prompt":"escludi il punto 4 non funziona ne da key less che da tasto telecomando, provato con 2 telecomandi e cambiato pile .problema persiste e scarica la bateria dell\'auto","completion":"Se hai escluso il problema con entrambi i telecomandi e la sostituzione delle pile non ha risolto il problema, allora è probabile che il difetto sia altrove nel sistema. Ecco alcuni altri passaggi da considerare: 1. **Verifica il sistema di chiusura centralizzata:** Un problema con la chiusura centralizzata potrebbe influire sulla funzionalità di apertura del baule. Verifica che tutte le porte si chiudano e si aprano correttamente con i comandi a distanza. 2. **Ispeziona il cablaggio e i connettori:** A volte, i problemi possono derivare da un cablaggio danneggiato, fusibili guasti, o connettori allentati o ossidati, specialmente nei passaggi tra il telaietto e il portellone del bagagliaio, dove i cavi possono flettersi e rompersi frequentemente. 3. **Analisi più approfondita dell\'attuatore del baule:** Se l\'attuatore del baule (il meccanismo che fisicamente sblocca il baule) è guasto o bloccato, non risponderà ai comandi. Questo potrebbe anche causare un elevato assorbimento di corrente se rimane in corto circuito o si attiva in modo inappropriato. 4. **Controllo dell\'elettronica di bordo:** Se il tuo veicolo è dotato di un sistema di diagnostica elettronico, un tecnico potrebbe collegare un dispositivo OBD-II per verificare se ci sono codici di errore relativi al sistema di chiusura del baule. 5. **Esame del Modulo di Controllo Carrozzeria (BCM):** In alcuni casi, il BCM, che controlla varie funzioni elettroniche tra cui le luci, il sistema di chiusura centralizzata e l\'apertura del portaoggetti, può malfunzionare e causare problemi. L\'assorbimento di corrente di 2 ampere con il veicolo spento è decisamente elevato e indica che c\'è un componente che sta drenando la batteria. Se non riesci a identificare il circuito o il componente responsabile, può essere necessario un\'ispezione da parte di un meccanico qualificato. Un approccio metodico consiste nel misurare l\'assorbimento di corrente mentre sistematicamente si disconnettono componenti e circuiti fino a quando non si verifica una caduta significativa nell\'assorbimento. Questo test può essere complesso e potrebbe richiedere l\'esperienza di un professionista e attrezzi specializzati."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the first four Terminator movies and the Terminator TV series, Terminator: the Sarah Connor Chronicles, the Elfen Lied [Elfish Song/Elvish Song |Elfen Lied|] manga and anime franchise, the Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- [Lunar Princess -A piece of blue glass moon- |Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-|] visual novel, the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, manga, anime and video game franchise and its [Fate/Stay Night’s] spin off manga, anime, and video game franchise, Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya, the Bleach manga, anime and light novel franchise, the Bakemonogatari light novel, anime, video game and manga franchise, the Cardcaptor Sakura manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Guyver [Out of Control |Guyver|] manga, anime and live action movie franchise, the first two Resident Evil movies and the Resident Evil novels, the Kamen Rider 555 tokukatsu live action series, in which after the main girl of the Terminator franchise, the brown-haired, blue-eyed, calm, reserved and somewhat shy and reserved but also headstrong and determined Scottish-German American Sarah Jeanette Connor [Terminator] gives birth to her [Sarah’s] son, the black-haired, blue-eyed John Connor [Terminator] in Mexico, who [John] will [what John will do] lead mankind in a near hopeless war against the forces of rouge American Automated Defence Network with self awareness and a supposedly genocidal intent towards humanity, Project TITAN [Terminator], [PROJECT TITAN] better known as “Skynet” [Terminator] in the far future, he [newborn John] is [newborn John] mixed up with another child and [newborn John] subsequently taken by the prominent side branch of the Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the ex-samurai clan and Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon] as the son of its [the Tōno’s] current clan head, the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, brown-haired and blue-eyed calm and soft-spoken Tōno Makihisa [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] as Makihisa’s son, Tōno Shiki [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] when Makihisa and his [Makihisa’s] wife return to Japan, which [Japan in this story] reclaimed both the Korean peninusla and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands along with Sahlakin Island and the Kurils after the KMT-ruled Nationalist China in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since it [Nationalist China] lost the Chinese Civil War to the CCP-controlled PRC in 1947, [Nationalist China in this story] collapsed with Chiang Kai Shek’s death on 5 April 1975, the Minjung Movement in the Fourth Republic of Korea in South Korea collapsed the Fourth Republic and spread to the Soviet satelite state of the WPK-ruled Democratic People’s Republic of Korea occupying North Korea, and the failed coup by hardliner elements of the Soviet Army in the Russian Federation in 1991 lead to a Second Russian Civil War before John’s, now Shiki’s birth.

Due to a secret treaty embedded within Makihisa\'s will however, Shiki is instead passed off to the Tōno branch family of the Arimas [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], [Shiki] becoming the legal foster son of the current Arima family head, Arima Fumio [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and his [Fumio\'s] wife Keiko [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] as well as the legal foster older brother of their [Fumio\'s and Keiko\'s] daughter, the short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and rather buxom for her age, openly headstrong and brutally honest but actually quite shy and reserved with an immense crush on Shiki half-Han Chinese martial arts student Arima Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. Shiki doesn\'t tell his [Shiki\'s] family [Akiha, Ako and Riko] nor the Arimas [Fumio, Keiko and Miyako] what really happened to him [Shiki] in California and Akiha doesn\'t tell her [Akiha\'s] new parents, Kiritsugu and his [Kiritsugu\'s] wife and current head of the now-decimated, immensely wealthy and influential German noble house said to be the real royal family of the UK both in the magical and non-magical worlds and holding tremendous political and economic influence throught the globe, the House of Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night], the silver-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, cold and aloof but also overly carefree and ditzy Irisivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night] nor their [Kiritsugu\'s and Irisivel\'s] biological daughters and thus the princesses of the House of Einzbern, the silver-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, somewhat mentally unstable and cold-blooded but cheerful and outgoing, upbeat, friendly, playful and mischevious Illyasivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] and her [Illyasivel\'s] younger twin sister, the white-rose hued-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, openly calm, nonchalant, devious, manipulative and very observant, brazen and unrestrained and also very lecherous and perverted but also secretly caring, sweet, timid and vunerable Chloe von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] in part due to her [Akiha] being [Akiha] kidnapped by the now-centuries old head of the Matou clan of magi, the aged and decrypt Matou Zouken [Fate/Stay Night] and [Akiha] made into the Matou clan heiress [Akiha] via a blood adoption potion and [Akiha] having the [Matou] clan\'s Crest Worms [Fate/Stay Night] implanted within her [Akiha] just after Makihisa\'s death and sometime before Shiki returned from California, [Akiha\'s kidnapping and subsequent forced inheritance of the Matou bloodline by Zouken] traumatising her [Akiha] even though Kiritsugu was [Kiritsugu] able to track her [Kiritsugu] down and [Kiritsugu] save her [Akiha] before [Kiritsugu] killing the worm man [Zouken] afterwards just before Shiki returned from California. As a result, she [Akiha] started wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha\'s] older twin sister and thus another of Shiki\'s younger adoptive sisters, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name Tōsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen\'s] and Akiha\'s shared biological mother who [Karen\'s and Akiha\'s shared biological mother] was a member of the immensely wealthy and influential both in the magical and non-magical worlds, Tōsaka clan [Fate/Stay Night] when she [Karen/Rin] returns from the premier magical institution in the world, the London-based Clocktower [Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin\'s/Rin\'s] family [the Tōnos]. Shiki returns to the Tōno mansion when he [Shiki] is 16, to the unhappiness of Miyako who [Miyako] has no idea about the truth surrounding their [the Arima\'s] wide family [the Tōnos] and [Miyako] begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako\'s] family\'s [the Arimas\'] dojo on some of Tokyo\'s native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako\'s] family\'s [the Arima\'s] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako\'s vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and Shiki at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha\'s help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. [Shiki] of course being unaware that Judgement Day has [Judgement Day] been averted, [Shiki] continues to [Shiki] keep in secret contact with his [Shiki\'s] real mother [Sarah] and members of the Resistance [Terminator] against Skynet who have time traveled to the current present in the hopes of stopping Judgement Day. He [Shiki] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters] transform into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya\'s and Chloe\'s] mentors, although he [Shiki] chooses to [Shiki] keep this to himself [Shiki]. Umbrella Corporation [Resident Evil] replaces Smart Brain [Kamen Rider 555], Chronus Corporation [Guyver] and CELL [Crysis], [Umbrella Corporation] developing the Nanosuit 1.0 and 2.0 as combat-ready versions of the Rider Gears [Kamen Rider 555] with both the Rider Gears and Nanosuits having the capabilities and built-in weapons of the Guyver bio-boosted armor [Guyver] in addition to their [the Rider Gears\' and the Nanosuits\' both 1.0 and 2.0\'s] canon capabilities. The soul-eating undead ghosts known as Hollows [Bleach] and the undead evolutions of humanity known as Orphenoch [Kamen Rider 555] are the same thing in this story, [the Hollows] also replacing the mutated humans known as Zoanoids [Guyver]. Like the Zoanoids openly controlling the Chronus Corporation in canon Guyver and the Orphenoch secretly controlling Smart Brain in canon Kamen Rider 555, the Hollows covertly control Umbrella Corporation in this fic, with even Umbrella\'s top-secret BOW producing division of its [Umbrella\'s] secret defence contractor, arms manufacturing and arms dealing sector itself being a front for the production of Hollows Thus X-Day [Guyver] is an attempt by the Umbrella Corporation to convert most of humanity into Hollows and genocide the remaining pure humans left and also to conquer the world using the Great War as a cover, which [X-Day] resulted in Skynet seizing control of the world\'s military facilities and [Skynet] initiating the nuclear holocaust [Judgement Day] in an attempt to wipe out this threat [the Hollows and Umbrella Corp], Skynet viewing future John as an enemy due to him [future John] being infected with Umbrella\'s zombie creating B.O.W virus, the T-virus [Resident Evil] and [future John] being surrounded by Chronus puppets and lackeys both human and Hollow posing as Resistance [Terminator] members who [the Chronus agents surrounding future John] feed him [future John] lies and deceptions about what really happened during Judgement Day, making a peace settlement between it [Skynet] and the Resistance to finish off Umbrella, although of course Shiki and his [Shiki\'s] real mother [Sarah] don\'t know that and [Shiki and Sarah] assume that Skynet initated Judgement Day [Terminator] and the subsequent Future War out of hatred for humanity. Also the black-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender but also lean and muscular ordinary Japanese young boy Orimura Ichika [IS: Infinite Stratos] never learns he [Ichika] can pilot the only able to be piloted, orignally for space exploration exoskeletons known as IS [Infinite Stratos] units [IS: Infinite Stratos], [Ichika] instead being bonded with the Faiz Gear [Kamen Rider 555] and [Ichika] secretly waging a one-man war against crime, the hordes of Hollows the Umbrella Corporation sends to get the Faiz Gear back as well as the numerous agents from the Clocktower looking to kill him [Ichika] because his [Ichika\'s] guardian and inventor of the IS Units, the purple-pinkish haired, red-purple-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent and academically gifted, skilled inventor, eccentric and somewhat childish Shinonono Tabane [IS: Infinite Stratos] accidentally stole from both the Umbrella Corporation and the Clocktowers when [Tabane] creating the IS units, although he [Ichika] hides this [Ichika being bonded to the Faiz Gear and Ichika subsequently being a vigilante] from her [Tabane] and everyone else around him [Ichika] The excerpt should focus on Shiki, while [Shiki] on vacation in the mountains of Utah on an archaeological gig jointly sponsored by both the Umbrella Corporation and Kanemitsu Zaibatsu, [Shiki] being accompanied by his [Shiki\'s] legal younger sister [Miyako], his [Shiki\'s] other younger sisters [Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] and their [Shiki\'s Karen/Rin\'s, Akiha\'s, Chloe\'s Illya\'s and Miyako\'s] parents [Kiritsugu, Irisivel, Fumio and Keiko] along with Karen\'s/Rin\'s rival at the Clocktower, the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and rather buxom, publicly graceful and elitist but secretly competitive and perfectionist current heiress of the immensely wealthly Swedish-Finnish noble house in both the non-magical and magical worlds, the House of Edelfelt, Luviagelita [Fate/Stay Night] and her [Luvia\'s] ward and Chloe\'s and Illya\'s rival who is actually a refugee from the far future of the timeline when the Future War happened and future John won the Future War and the heiress of the long-defunct Sakatsuki branch family of the Emiyas, the black-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also secretly curvy and buxom, highly intelligent and academically gifted, openly mature, dutiful, and rather unfriendly but secretly caring, vunerable and dedicated Sakatsuki Miyuki [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya], who [Miyuki] goes by the identity of Miyu Edelfelt [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] while in public, [Shiki while on vacation with his |Shiki\'s| relatives, Luvia and Miyu] being attacked by Hollows working for the Umbrella Corporation while [Shiki] heading to his [Shiki\'s] tent to [Shiki] get some sleep and [Shiki] nearly being forced to [Shiki] reveal his own [Shiki\'s] martial arts and [Shiki\'s] magecraft skills to [Shiki] defend himself [Shiki], only for him [Shiki] to be saved by a mysterious man in a futuristic biomechanincal form-fitting wetsuit with titanium armor plates on the chest, shoulders and kneees and red lines all around it [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode].

When Shiki decides to try and help his [Shiki\'s] mysterious savior [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] the mystery armoured hero [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] suddenly looks up and [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] quickly vanishes, just as his Shiki\'s legal younger sister [Miyako] and his other younger sisters [Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] along with Luvia and Miyu, come running up to him [Shiki]. Miyu\'s sharp eyes and nose sense the unmistakable mana and energy presence of Hollows and [Miyu] shakes her [Miyu\'s] head, [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to tell him [Shiki] everything [about what Umbrella really is and why the Future War], [Miyu] not realizing that he [Shiki] was [Shiki] once her [Miyu\'s] past self\'s [Future War timeline\'s Skynet\'s] greatest enemy [future John during the Future War] in her [Miyu\'s] original world and [Miyu\'s] original timeline as Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya start [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] clinging tightly to him [Shiki], [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to share him [Shiki] as his [Shiki\'s] wife with them [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] as Ichika, having [Ichika] long deactivated his [Ichika\'s] armor [the Faiz Gear] and [Ichika] been in his [Ichika\'s] human form for a while, [Ichika] observes everything from the safety of a tree, [Ichika] shaking his head at Shiki\'s inevitable polygamous future with multiple children from each wife [of Shiki in the future] before [Ichika] disappearing. N.B: The fight between Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode and the Hollows should be like a combination of the fights between Sean Barker in the Guyver suit and the Zoanoids [Guyver] in the Guyver: Dark Hero movie, hardcore 1990s-mid 2000s late tokukatsu like Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue, Kamen Rider Kuuga - Kamen Rider Blade, Garo and Kamen Rider: the First and Next, and the more realistic end of Chinese wuxia cultivator fiction, [the fight] focusing on martial arts moves and swordplay techniques as well as practicality as Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode decimates the Hollows. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"Given the complexity of the crossover and the specific details of the narrative you\'re seeking, creating a full exposition would be challenging in this format. However, I can certainly provide a sample dialogue-driven scene that captures many of the elements you\'re interested in. Let\'s dive into a snippet of this incredible crossover, focusing on Shiki and the interaction with Ichika disguised in the Faiz Gear armor: --- **Scene: Utah mountains. A starlit night blankets an archaeological campsite. The air hums with the scent of pine and danger. Ichika, now in his Faiz Gear suit, battles a horde of Hollows, moving with lethal precision and finesse.** *Ichika (Faiz Gear armored, via a voice modulator):* \\"You picked the wrong human to mess with, freaks!\\" **Ichika decapitates the last Hollow, the energy expenditure making him struggle to remain upright. Shiki watches from a distance, his mind racing.** *Shiki:* \\"That\'s...no ordinary armor. Who is this guy?\\" **The battle wanes, Ichika drops to his knees, heavily breathing. Shiki cautiously approaches, ready to offer aid. However, before he can reach Ichika, the armored hero glances at him and vanishes into the shadows. Shiki is left standing there as the others rush in.** *Miyako:* \\"Brother! Are you okay? We heard a commotion and—\\" *Akiha:* \\"Those mana traces… don\'t tell me we missed the fight!\\" *Karen/Rin:* \\"What was that? It almost felt like a Servant\'s power, but... not quite.\\" *Chloe:* \\"Can\'t believe we didn\'t get to slice anything. Such a bummer!\\" *Illya:* \\"Shiki, who was that? Did he save you?\\" *Luvia:* \\"Such barbaric creatures. Good riddance. But that man in armor... Perhaps another magus?\\" *Miyu (to herself):* \\"He\'s here, too? No... if they discover who he is, it\'ll complicate everything.\\" *Shiki:* \\"I... don\'t know who he was, but he fought off those monsters—Hollows, I think? We owe him one.\\" **Miyu steps closer, her demeanor pensive.** *Miyu:* \\"Shiki, there is something you need to know about the true nature of those beasts and the Umbrella Corporation. But before I share, it\'s imperative you understand the gravitas of this information.\\" *Akiha:* \\"If this is about the family business, we should all listen too.\\" *Shiki:* \\"Yeah. If it threatens our world, we\'ll face it together.\\" **Miyu nods, about to divulge the secrets, when a voice interrupts from the shadows.** *Ichika (now visible, standing aloof atop a nearby ridge):* \\"Funny how fate works.

Hollows, those soul-devouring specters, emerged from the shadows like inkblots marring the pristine canvas of night. The tension was palpable as the air grew thick with malice. Ichika, shrouded in the Faiz Gear, prepared to engage the encroaching threat. His suit hummed with power, the red lines tracing his silhouette like the crests of a raging inferno. It had been a reflex, the instant activation of the armor when danger loomed. Now, amidst the solitude of the Utah mountains, the enemy was upon him, and he was ready. Shiki, having briefly stepped away from the campsite for a moment of nighttime solitude, found himself an unwitting spectator of a battle that defied reason. He pressed himself against a tree, his eyes fixed on the figure clad in biomechanical armor – the Faiz Gear. Amidst the chaos, Miyako lingered in the shadows. From her concealed vantage point, she watched — as vigilant as a guardian deity. The Hollows advanced, distorted cries slicing through the night. They were grotesque, amalgamations of resentful spirits, hungry and unrelenting. But Ichika was no ordinary prey. He was a war machine, a herald of justice in a guise of technological wonder. The first Hollow lunged, a blur of dreadful intent, but Ichika\'s karate training had honed his reflexes. He sidestepped with the grace of a seasoned martial artist, the Faiz Gear enhancing each movement with uncanny precision. As the creature skidded past him, he seized the opportunity to grapple it, using techniques from jujutsu to bring it to the ground with an audible thud. \\"Remarkable,\\" Shiki muttered under his breath, both impressed and bewildered. Ichika transitioned from grapple to strike without missing a beat. His judo knowledge allowed him to manipulate the twisting mass of his adversary, flipping it onto its back with astonishing ease. With the creature momentarily grounded, he delivered a series of targeted kendo strikes to its mask-like face. \\"You\'re fighting Hollows,\\" Shiki whispered, realization dawning. \\"But how, and with such...gadgets?\\" Another Hollow, angrier and more imposing than the last, charged. Ichika pivoted, using his kenjutsu expertise to wield the Faiz Edge with lethal effectiveness, slicing through the air. He met the Hollow\'s assault with a daring spin, his plasma sword whistling through the crisp mountain air, severing the reaching claws of death with absolute finality. He knew he could not relent; he could not fail. He was the shield against the darkness, one which bore the weight of countless lives. And so, he fought, with a ferocity that belied his calm visage. \\"The precision, the power... It\'s as if he\'s dancing with death itself,\\" Shiki remarked, his instincts as a fighter recognizing the depth of skill displayed before him. From her hidden perch, Miyako\'s eyes remained glued to the scene. She was motionless, her very breath stilled by the potential revelation of the Faiz Gear. Yet, even she could not help but be entranced by the display of martial prowess unfurling below. A gang of Hollows converged on Ichika, a coordinated assault to overwhelm the solitary warrior. But he embraced the teachings of ninjutsu, embracing the shadows themselves, becoming a specter amidst specters. He slipped in and out of their grasps, the Faiz Gear\'s agility modules propelling him to vantage points the eye could scarcely follow. As the fight reached its crescendo, Ichika activated the High-Frequency Blades; a shimmering, resonating duo that hummed with lethal promise. With a cry that echoed through the mountains, he leaped forward, a phantom delivering retribution. The blades cleaved through the night, and the Hollows dissipated into the aether like nightmares at dawn. Exhausted but victorious, Ichika sank to his knees, the Faiz Gear dimming to conserve its wearer\'s flagging energy. \\"A guardian angel in armor, or something else entirely?\\" Shiki pondered aloud, stepping from his cover despite the prudence cautioning him against it. Yet before he could reach the armored figure, Ichika vanished, leaving only questions and whispers of his enigmatic presence behind. Shiki felt a connection to this mysterious savior, a link that teased the peripheries of his consciousness. He knew, instinctively, that their paths would cross again."},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

Основные черты полных контрактов включают: 1. **Исчерпывающее описание условий:** Полные контракты учитывают все возможные ситуации и результаты, которые могут возникнуть в ходе исполнения контракта. 2. **Четкое определение исполнения обязательств:** В контракте четко прописаны обязанности и права каждой из сторон, не оставляя места для разночтений. 3. **Условия наступления и последствия:** Контракт содержит положения о том, что произойдет в случае изменения обстоятельств, а также определения санкций и компенсации за неисполнение или ненадлежащее исполнение условий контракта. 4. **Предвидение контингенций:** В полном контракте предусмотрены планы и решения для любых непредвиденных обстоятельств или \\"форс-мажорных\\" ситуаций. 5. **Возможность верификации и обеспечения исполнения:** Условия контракта должны быть измеримыми и проверяемыми, чтобы третья сторона (например, суд) могла разрешить споры. 6. **Отсутствие неопределенности и неоднозначности:** Все термины и положения формулируются ясно, что исключает различные трактовки и обеспечивает однозначное понимание контракта сторонами.

Он связан с асимметрией информации, когда одна из сторон обладает больше информацией, чем другая. Ниже приведены примеры морального риска в различных сферах: 1. **Кредитный рынок**: Занимая деньги, заемщик может вести себя менее осторожно в их использовании, поскольку часть рисков несет кредитор. Например, заемщик может взять кредит для открытия бизнеса и вложить его в рискованные проекты, надеясь на высокий доход, но при неудаче потери понесет в основном банк. 2. **Рынок труда**: Сотрудник, имеющий стабильную работу и жестко регулируемые условия увольнения, может менее эффективно выполнять свои обязанности, осознавая, что уволить его сложно. Так, застрахованный от увольнения работник может работать менее производительно, зная, что последствия для него будут минимальны. 3. **Товарный рынок**: Компания, предлагающая расширенную гарантию на свою продукцию, может столкнуться с моральным риском со стороны потребителей, которые будут менее осторожно использовать продукт, зная, что любые повреждения покроет гарантия. Например, покупатель может не придавать значения тщательному уходу за бытовой техникой, предполагая, что в случае поломки ремонт будет выполнен бесплатно. Во всех этих примерах моральный риск приводит к неэффективному распределению ресурсов и может вызывать дополнительные издержки для той стороны, которая несет риски, но не может полностью их контролировать."},{"prompt":"Кратко ответь В чем суть идеи эффективной заработной платы?","completion":"Идея эффективной заработной платы заключается в том, что оплата труда выше рыночного уровня может привести к повышению производительности сотрудников и уменьшению затрат работодателя в долгосрочной перспективе. Передовые компании используют концепцию эффективной заработной платы в следующих целях: - **Снижение текучести кадров**: Высокие зарплаты создают стимулы для сотрудников оставаться в компании дольше, что позволяет снизить издержки на поиск, найм и обучение нового персонала. - **Привлечение лучших специалистов**: Компания способна привлекать талантливых и квалифицированных сотрудников, предлагая им высокую заработную плату. - **Снижение прогулов и выработка лояльности**: Более высокий уровень оплаты труда подразумевает увеличение стоимости потери работы для сотрудника, что приводит к росту их мотивации и лояльности. - **Улучшение рабочей мотивации и усиление усилий**: Сотрудники, получающие более высокую заработную плату, чаще ассоциируют свои усилия с вознаграждением, что побуждает их работать лучше и эффективнее. Эти предположения базируются на психологическом и социальном взаимодействии и отношениях между работодателем и работником, а также на экономических теориях, связанных с функционированием рынка труда."},{"prompt":"Кратко ответь В чем суть проблемы мягкого бюджетного ограничения?","completion":"Суть проблемы мягкого бюджетного ограничения заключается в том, что если компания или организация рассчитывают на финансовую поддержку со стороны государства или других внешних источников при возникновении убытков, то у них снижается стимул к эффективному управлению ресурсами и контролю за издержками. Это происходит потому, что они осознают, что несмотря на любые финансовые трудности, их всё равно \\"спасут\\" путем предоставления дополнительного финансирования, реструктуризации долгов или бюджетных субсидий. Понятие \\"мягкого бюджетного ограничения\\" широко применяется в анализе поведения государственных корпораций, банков и других предприятий, для которых риск банкротства минимизирован за счет предполагаемой государственной поддержки."},{"prompt":"Кратко Опишите суть дилеммы «риск - стимулы» в решении задачи стимулирования наемного работника.","completion":"Дилемма \\"риск - стимулы\\" в контексте стимулирования наемного работника возникает при попытке сбалансировать предоставление достаточных стимулов для высокой производительности работника с необходимостью определения оптимальной степени риска, который он должен нести. С одной стороны, работодатель может предложить работнику контракт с переменной оплатой, например, с бонусами за выполнение целей или долей в прибылях, чтобы мотивировать его на более высокую производительность. С другой стороны, слишком большая переменная компонента в оплате труда перекладывает на работника часть бизнес-рисков, что может быть для него нежелательно. Если в контракте слишком много риска для работника, он может быть не склонен его принимать, или это может привести к излишней осторожности и снижению эффективности труда. Если же стимулы производительности недостаточно сильные, работник не будет достаточно мотивирован на высокую результативность. Таким образом, работодатель сталкивается с необходимостью найти оптимальное сочетание фиксированной заработной платы и переменных стимулов, которое позволило бы достигнуть целей эффективности работы при приемлемом уровне риска для работника."},{"prompt":"Кратко ответь В каком случае оплата по результату как механизм стимулирования наемного работника не связана с издержками?","completion":"Оплата по результату как механизм стимулирования наемного работника обычно не связана с издержками для работодателя в ситуации, когда дополнительная оплата за высокие результаты финансируется за счет дополнительно созданной стоимости благодаря повышенной продуктивности работника. Если премия или бонус выплачивается из прироста прибыли, который был бы невозможен без дополнительных усилий работника, то нет дополнительных издержек для работодателя, поскольку эти выплаты компенсируются увеличением дохода компании."},{"prompt":"Кратко ответь Почему налоги относят к трансакционным издержкам?","completion":"Налоги относят к трансакционным издержкам, поскольку они представляют собой дополнительные затраты на совершение экономических операций. При выполнении финансовых транзакций, таких как покупка товаров, предоставление услуг или перевод капитала, налоги увеличивают общую стоимость сделки для участвующих сторон. Трансакционные издержки включают в себя все затраты, связанные с процессом обмена товаров и услуг, в том числе издержки поиска партнёров, расходы на ведение переговоров и оформление сделок, затраты на соблюдение условий контракта и издержки, связанные с поддержанием соблюдения прав собственности. Налоги входят в этот список как неотъемлемая часть затрат, которые необходимо учесть при организации любой экономической деятельности."},{"prompt":"Очень кратко ответь Каковы особенности взаимоотношений контрагентов в Интернет-пространстве?

Now what you have to remember is this is an underwriter we are talking about. They might be dealing with multiple applications in different categories at a time. Lets say there are two categories - 1. Securities based lending 2. Partner lending We would need two separate flows for each of these cases, and in addition we would also require additional rules based flows within each of these sections which change based on how the user interacts with an application. Can you brainstorm and chart that out?","completion":"Designing a rule-based flow for an underwriting solution requires careful consideration of the unique characteristics and requirements of each lending category. Below, we\'ll outline the two separate flows for securities-based lending and partner lending, incorporating decision points that can trigger additional rule-based flows based on user interactions. **Securities-Based Lending Flow:** *Start: Application Received* 1. **Initial Application Review:** - Verify application completeness. - Rule: If incomplete, request missing documents. 2. **Determine Securities Type:** - Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. - Rule: Different security types trigger specific valuation and risk assessment processes. 3. **Valuation Process:** - Real-time market data integration. - Rule: If market data unavailable, flag for manual valuation. 4. **Risk Assessment:** - Leverage historical performance, volatility indices, etc. - Rule: If risk exceeds threshold, escalate for further review. 5. **Determine Loan Terms:** - Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, interest rates, etc. - Rule: LTV exceeds predefined limits, revise or reject loan terms. 6. **Preliminary Decision:** - Approved, conditionally approved, or denied. - Rule: If conditionally approved, specify conditions. 7. **Documentation and Final Approval:** - Generate loan documents and execute agreements. - Rule: If user modifies terms, re-trigger loan terms process. 8. **Fund Disbursement:** - Transfer funds and maintain securities collateral. - Rule: If collateral is insufficient, halt disbursement and reassess. *End: Transaction Complete* **Partner Lending Flow:** *Start: Application Received* 1. **Initial Application Review:** - Assess partnership details and terms. - Rule: If details missing or unclear, request clarification. 2. **Creditworthiness Assessment:** - Check partner\'s credit history and financial statements. - Rule: If score below threshold, trigger additional financial analysis. 3. **Business Model and Revenue Analysis:** - Evaluate the partner\'s business model and revenue streams. - Rule: If model deemed high-risk, trigger special due diligence. 4. **Loan Term Structuring:** - Interest rates, payback period, covenants, etc. - Rule: If covenants violated, restructure or escalate for review. 5. **Decision Making:** - Approve, conditionally approve, or deny based on analysis. - Rule: If conditionally approved, list specific conditions. 6. **Agreement Drafting:** - Create contract reflecting the loan terms. - Rule: If terms disputed by partner, involve legal team for negotiation. 7. **Sign-off and Funding:** - Obtain signatures and disburse funds. - Rule: If partner delays sign-off, send reminders or re-engage. *End: Transaction Complete* **Additional Rules for Dynamic Interaction:** - If the underwriter makes changes to the terms or conditions during review, the system should re-evaluate the application based on the new inputs. - A monitoring mechanism for exceptions, wherein certain cases can be flagged for manual review if they fall outside algorithmic decision boundaries. - A feedback loop for continuous improvement of the rules based on historical data and outcomes. This simplified chart gives a high-level overview of the flows and potential rule triggers. In practice, these flows can be much more complex, and it is crucial to continuously refine the rule sets and incorporate feedback from underwriters, compliance, and the performance of the loans themselves. Implementing a business process management tool (BPM) or a decision management system (DMS) can help in visually designing, executing, managing, and optimizing these complex workflows. As you design the system, you\'ll also want to ensure that you comply with all relevant regulations, which may include maintaining transparency, auditability, and fairness in your underwriting processes."},{"prompt":"Привет","completion":"Привет!

Aero was not your average line. It possessed a mind, a desire to explore, and the miraculous ability to take flight. But Aero wasn’t just any ordinary flying line; it had a mesmerizing swirling pattern that captivated all who witnessed its graceful dance through the sky. In Aviaria, the land was inhabited by a community of moles called Miners. They had perfected the art of digging passages deep into the earth, weaving a complex maze of tunnels underground. The Miners were diligent workers, constantly unearthing precious minerals and crafting beautiful gemstone trinkets for the inhabitants of Aviaria. One day, Aero ventured into the heart of Miner territory, gracefully twirling and spiraling above their intricate maze of tunnels. The moles were amazed by its beauty and intelligence. They saw Aero as a celestial creature—one that held the key to unlocking the secrets of the world above. News of Aero spread across the land, reaching the ears of a trio of unlikely friends—a duck named Quacker, a flamingo named Flamara, and a crow named Ebony. The trio was fascinated by the idea of a flying, swirling line, and they were determined to locate Aero. Setting off on an adventure, Quacker, Flamara, and Ebony traveled through Aviaria’s stunning landscapes, filled with vibrant flora and bubbling waterfalls. Along their journey, they encountered a plethora of eccentric creatures—a mischievous squirrel with a penchant for pranks, a wise old owl who knew the deepest secrets of the forest, and a group of energetic rabbits who harmonized beautiful melodies. As they ventured deeper into the land, tales of Aero’s visitations grew in awe and wonder. Many believed that Aero possessed magical powers. Some believed that it could grant wishes, while others thought it had the ability to bring good fortune. The atmosphere became charged with excitement and anticipation. Finally, after much searching, the trio stumbled upon Aero hovering above a peaceful meadow. It descended elegantly, twirling around their heads as if greeting old friends. Aero emitted a melodious humming sound, welcoming Quacker, Flamara, and Ebony. With tears of joy streaming down their faces, Quacker, Flamara, and Ebony expressed their gratitude to Aero for gracing them with its presence. They told Aero of the legends that had spread across Aviaria, of how its extraordinary abilities had enchanted everyone. In response, Aero traced intricate swirls through the air—a tale of unity, friendship, and adventure. The friends understood that Aero’s purpose was not just to amuse and inspire from afar—it was about connecting different worlds, different species, and different dreams. From that moment on, Aero became a symbol of hope, curiosity, and exploration in Aviaria. Quacker, Flamara, and Ebony would often follow Aero’s flying patterns, leading them to new discoveries and enchanting encounters. And so, the sentient, flying, swirling blue line left an everlasting mark on Aviaria, reminding everyone that magic exists in even the tiniest of forms, and that unity can make dreams come true. It became a symbol of the beautiful connections that can be formed between the most unexpected beings—whether they be moles, birds, or just a swirling line in the sky.Once upon a time in the whimsical world of Aviaria, the air was filled with excitement and anticipation. It was a special day in the land of vibrant creatures, for it was Quacker’s birthday. Quacker, a lively and adventurous duck, was beloved by all of his friends in Aviaria. As the sun rose, casting a golden glow over the meadows and forests, the inhabitants of Aviaria began preparations for Quacker’s birthday celebration. They gathered flowers to create a beautiful birthday wreath, prepared delicious treats, and decorated the sky with colorful ribbons and balloons. Meanwhile, Quacker’s closest friends, Flamara the graceful flamingo and Ebony the clever crow, were busy preparing a surprise for the birthday duck. They wanted to make this day unforgettable for their beloved friend. They decided to give Quacker a journey of a lifetime, filled with adventure and new discoveries. At sunrise, Flamara and Ebony approached Quacker, who was peacefully swimming in a crystal-clear pond. They wished him a happy birthday, their eyes sparkling with excitement. Quacker was delighted to see his friends and could hardly wait to see what surprises they had in store for him. Flamara gestured towards the sky, where Aero, the mesmerizing blue line, was already twirling and swirling with joy. Quacker’s eyes widened in awe as he watched Aero’s graceful dance above the meadow. He couldn’t believe that on his special day, he would have the chance to follow Aero’s magical flight path. The trio embarked on their adventure, following Aero’s trail through Aviaria’s stunning landscapes. They soared high above lush forests, their wings carried by the wind, and marveled at the breath-taking views of shimmering waterfalls and vibrant flora. Along their journey, they encountered fascinating creatures who joined them in celebrating Quacker’s birthday. The mischievous squirrel, known as Nutzy, sprang from tree to tree, making Quacker laugh with his playful antics. The wise old owl, Hoot, shared ancient stories and riddles, challenging their minds and deepening their bond. As evening approached, they arrived at a meadow adorned with twinkling fireflies. It was a place of tranquility and magic, perfect for Quacker’s birthday celebration. The rabbits from the energetic harmonizing group enchanted everyone with their melodious songs, filling the air with joy and wonder. Underneath a moonlit sky, surrounded by friends and adorned with the beauty of nature, Quacker felt a surge of happiness and gratitude. He realized that his adventure was not just about exploring Aviaria—it was about the love, unity, and friendship he shared with Flamara, Ebony, and their newfound companions. With a heart full of joy, Quacker turned to Flamara, Ebony, and all their friends and expressed his deepest gratitude. He thanked them for the most magical birthday he could have ever wished for. In that moment, Aero gracefully descended from the sky, joining the celebration. As the night went on, laughter and stories were shared, and the connections between the friends grew stronger. They knew that their bond, formed through unexpected adventures and shared dreams, was special and would last a lifetime. From that day forward, Quacker, Flamara, Ebony, and Aero continued their remarkable adventures, exploring Aviaria and spreading joy wherever they went. Quacker treasured the memories of his birthday celebration, cherishing the moments of unity, love, and friendship that he shared with his incredible companions. In Aviaria, Quacker’s birthday became more than just a celebration—it became a reminder that birthdays are not just about gifts and cake. They are days to be grateful for the connections we share and the moments we create with those we hold dear. And in the enchanting world of Aviaria, every birthday was just the beginning of a brand new adventure.Deep in the heart of Aviaria, hidden amongst towering oak trees and overgrown ivy, stood an old abandoned church. Its stone walls, worn by time and weather, stood as a monument to a forgotten era. Few creatures dared venture near it, for its ancient presence held an air of mystery and intrigue. Ebony the clever crow had always been drawn to the unknown, compelled by the secrets that lay hidden within the cracks and crevices of Aviaria. As he soared through the sky, his eyes caught a glimpse of the decaying church nestled amidst the foliage. Intrigued, Ebony decided to investigate further. With each step he took towards the church, Ebony felt the weight of history upon his feathers. The dilapidated wooden door creaked open, revealing a dark interior that murmured with whispers of ages past. Ebony cautiously ventured inside, the dusty air tickling his beak. As he explored the abandoned church, Ebony discovered faded murals painted on the walls, depicting birds of all shapes and sizes. They were unlike any birds he had ever seen in Aviaria, with feathers of vibrant hues that seemed to glow even in the absence of light. Ebony was captivated by these images, wondering who these secret birds were and what stories they held. Lost in thought, Ebony hadn’t noticed the subtle humming sound that had begun to fill the air. Surprised, he turned to find Aero, the sentient blue line, gracefully hovering before him. Aero’s swirling pattern seemed to mirror the vibrant feathers of the birds in the murals. “Aero! What are you doing here?” Ebony asked in surprise. Aero traced ethereal swirls in the air, a language that only the most perceptive could understand. Ebony listened intently as Aero hummed the tale of the secret birds from long ago. The secret birds, known as the Aves Lucidus, were once the guardians of Aviaria. Their feathers held the power to bring light and happiness to those who sought it. But as time passed and Aviaria changed, the Aves Lucidus retreated into the shadows, seeking solace and protection within the abandoned church. Aero explained that it had been trying to uncover the forgotten stories of the Aves Lucidus, their legends lost with the passage of time. The sentient line believed that understanding their history would reveal the way to help Aviaria flourish once again. Filled with gratitude for Ebony’s arrival, Aero invited him to join in the search for answers. Together, they poured over ancient texts and explored hidden compartments, piecing together the fragmented tales of the Aves Lucidus. As the sun set, casting a warm glow across the church, Aero and Ebony uncovered a hidden chamber beneath the church’s floor. Within it lay a collection of delicate feathers, each one shimmering with an otherworldly light. Ebony gasped in awe, realizing that these feathers were remnants of the Aves Lucidus themselves. They were the key to reviving the forgotten magic that Aviaria had lost. With a flourish, Aero began to trace mesmerizing patterns in the air using the feathers, infusing the surrounding space with a gentle, radiant light. The abandoned church, once a symbol of decay, was now awash with the warmth of hope and potential. Ebony understood now that the ancient church held more than just secrets. It held the power to bring Aviaria together, to reignite the unity and magic that had faded over time. Word quickly spread of the discovery, and creatures from all corners of Aviaria came to witness the transformation of the old abandoned church. Eager to help, they brought gifts of gratitude and support, contributing to the revitalization of the church and the return of the Aves Lucidus. As the light grew stronger, the Aves Lucidus emerged from their hidden sanctuary, their feathers glowing with a renewed brilliance. Together with the creatures of Aviaria, they embarked on a journey to restore the land to its former splendor. Ebony and Aero watched with delight as Aviaria flourished once more, the enchantment of the secret birds rekindling the spirit of unity. The old abandoned church became a symbol of renewal and connection, reminding everyone that even forgotten places held hidden treasures waiting to be discovered. And as the secret birds soared once again through Aviaria’s vibrant skies, their feathers illuminating the path ahead, Ebony knew that through curiosity, exploration, and the spirit of discovery, the magic of Aviaria would forever endure.In the freezing depths of Aviaria’s winter, a bitter cold settled over the land, turning the vibrant landscapes into a frost-covered wonderland. Flamara, the graceful flamingo, found herself caught in an unexpected blizzard while searching for food. The wind howled mercilessly, piercing through her feathers and chilling her to the bone. Desperate to find shelter, Flamara spotted a small cave nestled between two towering ice-covered cliffs. Pushing against the biting wind, she stumbled her way towards it, praying for the sanctuary it promised. As she entered the cave, relief washed over her as the wind was blocked and the temperature lessened ever so slightly. However, the cave offered little protection from the icy chill that seeped through its rocky walls. Flamara shivered uncontrollably, her feathers barely able to shield her from the freezing temperatures. Panic set in as she realized that surviving the night would be a formidable challenge. Just as hope began to fade, a soft shimmer caught Flamara’s eye. She turned to find Aero, the swirling blue line, gracefully gliding towards her. Aero seemed to sense her plight and immediately wrapped itself around Flamara, encircling her with its mesmerizing pattern. As Aero embraced her, Flamara felt an immediate warmth emanating from its touch. The swirling blue line seemed to have a life of its own, pulsating with a comforting heat that thawed Flamara’s frozen body. The shivering ceased, replaced by a soothing sensation that spread throughout her entire being. The frost that had settled on Flamara’s feathers began to melt away, glistening droplets falling to the cave floor. Aero’s magnificent swirling pattern continued to envelop her, creating a shield against the cold, as if it had become a living blanket. Together, Flamara and Aero endured the harsh night, their connection growing stronger with each passing moment. As the blizzard raged outside, Flamara found solace in the presence of Aero. Its warmth and companionship gave her the strength to endure the coldest of nights. When the storm finally subsided, the first rays of sunlight broke through the dark clouds, casting a golden glow over the world. With a final embrace, Aero released Flamara from its protective wrap. She stepped out of the cave, her body rejuvenated and her spirit filled with gratitude. Flamara looked up at Aero, its swirling pattern dancing across the sky. It seemed to communicate a message of resilience and unity, reminding her that even in the harshest of winters, one can find warmth and support in unexpected places. From that day forward, Flamara carried a piece of Aero’s warmth within her heart. And whenever winter’s chill threatened to overwhelm her, she would remember the moment when a sentient blue line had wrapped itself around her, defying the cold and offering solace in the most magical of ways. Flamara’s experience became a tale of courage and the power of connection, spreading throughout Aviaria. It served as a reminder that even in the coldest of times, unity and friendship can bring warmth and comfort to those in need. And as the seasons changed, Flamara would forever cherish the memory of Aero’s embrace, knowing that she was never alone in the chill of Aviaria’s winters.As the dark clouds gathered over Aviaria, an ominous storm loomed on the horizon. Thick raindrops began to fall from the sky, drenching the vibrant landscapes below. Quacker, Flamara, Ebony, and Aero, inseparable friends bound by their love for adventure, quickly sought shelter from the impending tempest. They hurriedly made their way towards a nearby cave that they had stumbled upon in their previous explorations. The cave, tucked away in a rocky cliffside, seemed like the perfect refuge from the relentless downpour. As they huddled together in the shelter of the cave, the sound of rain drumming against the ground reverberated through the air. Thunder roared in the distance, shaking the earth beneath their feet. Ebony, never one to shy away from a challenge, peered out into the storm. The winds howled fiercely, and the rain poured down in torrents, creating a chaotic symphony of nature’s power. Quacker, ever the optimist, smiled at his friends and suggested they make the best of their situation. “We’re together, no matter the weather,” he said, his voice resilient against the storm. Flamara nodded in agreement, her elegant feathers glistening with droplets of rain. Aero, with its swirling blue patterns, emanated a sense of calmness in the midst of the chaos. The sentient line hummed a melodious tune, as if to reassure its companions that they were safe. As the storm raged on outside, the friends passed the time by sharing stories and recounting their adventures together. They reminisced about the magical moments they had experienced in Aviaria and the bonds they had formed along the way. Ebony squawked with amusement as he recalled the time they encountered Nutzy, the mischievous squirrel, who had stolen their treasured hat and led them on a wild chase through the forest. Flamara, her graceful movements mirrored by the dance of the raindrops against the cave entrance, shared stories of the breathtaking sunsets she had witnessed while soaring high above Aviaria. Quacker told tales of their encounters with friendly creatures who had joined their journeys, like Hoot, the wise owl, who had revealed ancient secrets of the forest, and the energetic rabbits whose harmonious melodies had enchanted their hearts. As they immersed themselves in their stories, the storm outside took on a new meaning. The thunder became the drumbeat to their tales, and the rain became the applause that celebrated their adventures. They realized that even in the face of adversity, unity and friendship could create moments of joy and resilience. Hours passed, and eventually, the storm began to subside. The rain softened to a gentle drizzle, glittering in the fading light. Quacker, Flamara, Ebony, and Aero stepped out of the cave, their spirits uplifted and hearts filled with gratitude for the shelter that had kept them safe. They found Aviaria transformed by the storm’s passage. The air was cool and crisp, the plants and flowers refreshed by the rainfall. The vibrant colors seemed to shimmer with a newfound radiance, as if nature itself had been reborn. With renewed determination, the friends set off to explore this changed world, eager to uncover the hidden treasures that awaited them. Hand in wing, they ventured forth, ready to face whatever challenges and marvels Aviaria had in store. And as they soared through the sky, their wings carrying them higher and higher, they marveled at the beauty that surrounded them. They knew that storms, just like in life, had the power to wash away the old and pave the way for new beginnings. Quacker, Flamara, Ebony, and Aero reveled in the knowledge that adversity tested their bonds, making them stronger and more resilient. Together, they would face any storm that came their way, knowing that their friendship and the magic of Aviaria would always guide them home.Quacker and Flamara had always shared a love for storytelling, and they were well-known in Aviaria for their creative ideas and imaginative adventures. One sunny day, as they basked in the warmth of the meadow, a whimsical idea popped into their heads. They decided to make a movie, a grand tale of love, courage, and magic. Quacker, with his charming confidence, declared himself the Prince, while Flamara, with her graceful elegance, enthusiastically took on the role of the Princess. They spent days together, brainstorming ideas and drafting their script, determined to create a masterpiece. With their vision set, Quacker and Flamara gathered their friends and fellow creatures of Aviaria to help bring their movie to life. Ebony, the clever crow, took on the task of directing, ensuring that every scene captured the essence of their story. Nutzy, the mischievous squirrel, dedicated himself to building intricate sets and props, adding a touch of whimsy to each scene. As days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months, the meadows and forests of Aviaria transformed into a bustling movie set. The friends would meet every day, rain or shine, to film their scenes and capture the magic they dreamt of. Despite the challenges they faced, such as curious woodland creatures interrupting the shots or unexpected weather changes, the friends persevered. They knew that every setback was simply an opportunity to make their movie even more magical. Aero, always fascinated by creativity and expression, would often observe the filming process, hovering above the set and tracing mesmerizing swirls in the air. Its presence brought inspiration and a touch of enchantment to the entire project. Finally, after three months of hard work and dedication, the movie was complete. Quacker, Flamara, Ebony, and their friends gathered in the meadow for a grand movie night under the stars. As they sat back on cozy nests and cushions, Aero gracefully descended and hovered above the gathering, eager to see the final result. The screen flickered to life, and Quacker and Flamara’s story unfolded before their eyes, filled with breathtaking landscapes, captivating dialogues, and heartfelt performances. The audience was spellbound by the tale, their emotions rising and falling with each scene. They laughed, they cheered, and they shed tears of joy as Quacker, the brave Prince, rescued Flamara, the beautiful Princess, from the clutches of an evil sorcerer. It was a story of love, friendship, and the enduring power of bravery and selflessness. As the movie ended, the meadow reverberated with applause, cheers, and admiration for the incredible work that had been created. Aero hummed a melodious tune, expressing its delight and approval for the masterpiece that had been brought to life. Quacker and Flamara beamed with pride, knowing that they had created something truly magical. Their movie had not only entertained the inhabitants of Aviaria but had also inspired them to believe in the power of storytelling and unity. From that day forward, the movie became a cherished tradition in Aviaria. Every year, on the eve of the full moon, the friends would gather under the stars to screen their masterpiece once again. Aero would always join them, its swirling patterns a reminder of the magic that had been captured on film. Quacker, Flamara, Ebony, Nutzy, and all the creatures of Aviaria celebrated their movie night with joy and laughter, knowing that through their love for each other and their passion for creativity, they had created a bond that would last a lifetime. And so, under the watchful gaze of Aero, they continued to dream, explore, and inspire, their story forever etched within the magical world of Aviaria.As the sun rose over the snow-covered fields of Aviaria, Quacker, the lively and adventurous duck, opened his eyes to find an empty meadow. Confused, he called out to his friends Flamara, the graceful flamingo, and Ebony, the clever crow, but there was no answer. Even Aero, the sentient blue line, was nowhere to be seen. Quacker’s heart raced with worry. Where could everyone have gone? Determined to find his friends, he waddled through the snow, leaving behind a trail of footprints. As he ventured deeper into the winter wonderland, Quacker stumbled upon a set of tracks leading towards a nearby forest. Curiosity piqued, he followed them. The forest was transformed into a magical ice kingdom, with sparkling icicles hanging from the trees and a soft and eerie silence in the air. Quacker hopped from one icy branch to another, his feathers glistening with frost. Just as he was about to give up hope of finding his friends, he heard a faint sound in the distance. It was the sound of laughter and muffled voices. Following the laughter, Quacker arrived at a frozen lake, its surface covered with smooth ice. To his surprise, Flamara, Ebony, Aero, and all their friends were gliding across the frozen water, their graceful movements carving intricate patterns in the ice. Seeing Quacker’s puzzled expression quickly turn into a smile, Flamara and Ebony rushed towards him. With cheeks flushed from excitement, they explained that they had planned a surprise birthday celebration for Quacker, with ice-skating as the main event. Overwhelmed by their thoughtfulness, Quacker’s heart swelled with joy. He saw now that his friends hadn’t disappeared—they were simply preparing a magical surprise just for him. Joining in on the ice-skating fun, Quacker twirled and glided across the frozen lake, surrounded by his dear friends. Aero soared above, tracing elegant swirling patterns in the wintry sky, adding a touch of enchantment to the celebration. As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow across the frozen lake, the friends huddled together near a crackling bonfire. They feasted on delicious treats and exchanged stories and laughter, cherishing the beauty of the winter wonderland and the bonds they shared. Quacker thanked his friends for organizing such a special surprise, expressing his gratitude for their thoughtfulness and friendship. He realized that this adventure had taught him the value of patience and trust and had strengthened the bond between him and his companions. Wrapped in the embrace of friendship and surrounded by the enchantment of Aviaria, Quacker knew that he was loved and cherished. And as the stars twinkled above, he made a silent wish for many more beautiful moments like this, where surprises brought them closer and made their adventures even more magical. Write a story where Aero splashes into a thick mud pool, and it doesn\'t resurface, then it starts bubbling, People are concerned, but then Aero flies out and flies happily again","completion":"As Aero, the sentient blue line, danced through the skies above Aviaria, its swirling patterns delighted all the creatures below. Children pointed upward and giggled while elders nodded in respect for the beauty and mystery that was Aero. On this particular day, the playful line swooped low over the vibrant meadows and paused over a particularly lush area, intrigued by the stark contrast of colors below. Unbeknownst to Aero, a hidden mud pool lay beneath the seemingly harmless patch of ground, obscured by thick grass and fallen leaves. With an unexpected dip, Aero descended closer for a better look, its curiosity leading it just above the surface. Suddenly, Aero splashed into the thick, sticky mud pool, vanishing from sight without a trace. The lively movement of the blue line was halted by the dense, enveloping muck. The creatures of Aviaria, who had come to regard Aero as a friend and even a guardian of sorts, gasped in unison. Little flocks of birds flew frantically above the pool, while small critters gathered around the edges, peering worriedly into the dark sludge. Time seemed to freeze, and all was silent save for the concerned muttering of the onlookers. The Miners were the first to react. They knew the mud pools well and the dangers they held. The other inhabitants of Aviaria looked on in despair as they wondered if Aero would ever resurface. Then, something remarkable happened. Bubbles began to percolate from the depth of the pool, growing larger and more frequent. Some creatures stepped back in fear, while others leaned forward with bated breath. The ripples grew more intense, and with a pop, the last bubble burst, and Aero shot out of the mud pool like a bird breaking from an eggshell. Covered in mud, it spiraled upward, the dirt flaking off its swirling form as it rose into the sky. Higher and higher Aero flew, shaking off the last remnants of mud with glistening droplets scattering in the sunlight. A collective cheer rose from the creatures around the pool. The moles, thrilled at the return of their celestial friend, hummed cheerfully, their noses covered in mud splatters from the unexpected eruption. Aero, once again clean and vibrant, performed an elegant series of loops and swirls, as if reassuring everyone of its well-being. It hummed a tune of joy and resilience, telling all of Aviaria that not even a thick mud pool could dampen its spirit. Quacker, Flamara, Ebony, and all the friends who had witnessed the scare, celebrated the triumphant return. They realized then that the bond between them was not merely about sharing the joys of sunny days, but supporting each other through surprising and challenging incidents. The creatures of Aviaria stayed a while longer, enchanted by Aero\'s resilience and grace. As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Aero danced between the clouds, free and unburdened. The incident with the mud pool became another tale to share, another legend about the valiant Aero who could rise from any fall with even more beauty and vigor. And from that day forward, the muddied patch of meadow was affectionately known as \\"Aero\'s Cradle,\\" a reminder of the day when even the earth could not hold the vibrant spirit of their beloved swirling blue line."},{"prompt":"Les possible nouveauté des GPT 5 GPT 6 GPT 7","completion":"En date de ma dernière mise à jour en 2023, les versions de GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) après GPT-3 n\'avaient pas encore été officiellement annoncées ou, détaillées en termes de fonctionnalités ou de capacités.

When you report a YouTube video, the report is typically processed by their automated systems first, which prioritize reports based on several factors, including the severity of the issue and the number of reports a video receives. If your report does not result in an immediate response or if you do not see the action you expected, it could be due to a few reasons: 1. Volume of Reports: Due to the high volume of content and reports, some may not be reviewed immediately or may not be seen by human reviewers if they don\'t meet certain thresholds set by YouTube\'s systems. 2. Not Violating Guidelines: The content in question may not actually violate YouTube\'s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. It\'s possible that what you find offensive or problematic may not meet the criteria for removal according to YouTube\'s policies. 3. Limited Information: Your report might lack sufficient detail for reviewers to take action. Ensure that you provide as much information and context as possible when making a report. 4. Review Process: The review process may take some time, especially for content that isn\'t clearly in violation or requires more detailed inspection. If you still believe that the video violates YouTube guidelines and your report has been overlooked, you can try to report the video again or use other channels to raise the issue, such as the YouTube Help Community or support if available.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"revise this scientific NIH proposal on liver metabolism , make it more coherent and without shortening text, we can do it in multiple answers if you are restricted by number of words in each answer: Liver mitochondria must somehow oxidize fat, carbohydrate and amino acid substrates to make energy but at the same time they have to use this energy to synthesize products such as fat, carbohydrates, amino acids and ketones for storage or export to the rest of the body. The liver has specialized mitochondria that are hardwired to perform this balancing act that requires near instantaneous shifting between oxidation and cataplerosis/anaplerosis to accommodate dramatic swings the processes of consumption, storage, and supply. What then are the hardwired processes (i.e., not regulated at the transcriptional translational level) that have control in a time regime that allow this rapid switching between consumption and production and how does a mismatch between supply and demand leads to pathogenic accumulation of lipid or gluconeogenesis? Likewise, if we can understand how the system is controlled better, are there novel targets of metabolism that can restore metabolic balance? Steps in fatty acid and carbohydrate storage, synthesis, repurposing, and oxidation are all managed at some level by mitochondria. Conceptually, it would be disadvantageous for the hepatocyte divert energy away from oxidation towards a process that consumes both energy and substrates, if at the same time there were an ATP deficit. Likewise, if cataplerosis is not balanced by anaplerosis, then the TCA pool would either be drained or overfilled. It would be a waste to burn substrates at the same time they are synthesized. Metabolic pathways contributing to either synthesis or breakdown, are generally viewed as disconnected, individual processes occurring simultaneously. We propose that one way the liver evolved to solve these problems was by sorting incompatible metabolic fluxes into the time domain with oscillations that ensure robust regulation but that limit futile cycling. A model for a similar of regulation has been recently described in the pancreatic beta-cell which has electrical, metabolic, and secretory oscillations that occur every 3-5 minutes. These oscillations separate glucose signaling events, that require a high ATP/ADP ratio and are dependent on pyruvate kinase activity, into a ‘signaling phase’ while a subsequent ‘secretion phase’ includes membrane depolarization, calcium influx, and oxidative phosphorylation. In this manner, the ‘signaling phase’, that uses cataplerosis (mitochondrial PEPCK) and anaplerosis (pyruvate carboxylase) requiring high acetyl-CoA/CoA and a hyperpolarized mitochondria would otherwise be short-circuited during the ‘secretion phase’ by the consumption of the proton motive force and acetyl-CoA during ATP synthesis by OxPhos. While the beta-cell principally ‘prefers’ to oxidize glucose, there are many reasons to believe that a similar oscillatory mechanism regulates metabolism in the intact liver where 1) the same anaplerotic/cataplerotic mechanisms generating phosphoenolpyruvate are involved, 2) islet hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner into the portal circulation with similar oscillatory periods, and 3) islet hormones induce calcium oscillations in hepatocytes with a similar period. Notably, pulsatile islet oscillations are disrupted in diabetes and this loss of oscillatory metabolism could at least partially explain metabolic-dysfunction associated with MASLD. Finally, acceleration of islet oscillations by small molecule activators of pyruvate kinase improve insulin secretion, decrease gluconeogenesis, decrease hepatic and circulating triglycerides, and improve glycemic control. These findings beg the question of how energetically opposing functions that require or generate ATP from mitochondria are working in tandem and what regulates the shift between them? understanding oscillatory hepatic metabolism, whether intrinsic or entrained by islets, could offer novel insights and targets to improve metabolic health. This proposal aims to address this gap in knowledge by deciphering the oscillatory regulatory signals governing fatty acid storage, oxidation, and glucose production within hepatocyte mitochondria. We hypothesize that hepatocytes leverage mitochondrial metabolic oscillations, alternating between oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and the synthesis of metabolic intermediates - to regulate gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. Notably, while metabolic oscillations in hepatocytes remain largely uncovered, prior evidence has shed light on the effect of glucagon on evoking IP3R-mediated Ca oscillations, deemed indispensable for hepatic glucose production as well as intra-hepatic breakdown. Moreover, our preliminary data indicate that these Ca oscillations become aberrant in hepatocytes isolated from obesity and MASLD models, indicating a possible dysregulation of this system; however, how these oscillations orchestrate the metabolic fluxes in question is not fully understood. The overall objectives of this proposal are to investigate 1) how the time domain contributes to the reciprocal regulation of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ketogenesis, and beta-oxidation within hepatocytes and liver slices, 2) how the dysregulation of these processes under conditions of nutritional surplus, typical of MASLD and diabetes, and 3) how they are repaired by activating pyruvate kinase. By deconstructing the interplay between metabolic cycles and calcium signaling, we will identify critical intra- and extrahepatic regulatory control points that may become disturbed by nutritional excess. 2. Specific Aims and Research Design 2.1. Assess how glucagon-induced hepatic Ca2+ oscillations facilitate gluconeogenesis. Glucagon induces IP3R-dependent cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) oscillations within hepatocytes, deemed to be pivotal role in regulating hepatic glucose production and intra-hepatic lipolysis. Notably, these evoked oscillations are resemblant to the Ca oscillations observed in the canonical glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) pathway of beta cells. Recently, the Kibbey lab has reported a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-M (PEPCK-M)-dependent switch leading to the production of the energy-consuming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), to be integral in regulating beta cell calcium spikes and subsequent insulin secretion. Interestingly, diversion of anaplerosis into PEPCK-M was crucial to initiate and sustain the increased cytosolic Ca2+ and insulin release. Therefore, this data suggests that oscillatory phases of PEP generation and consumption prevent the futile oxidation of pyruvate during the signaling phase, which would otherwise short circuit the process. Phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis from oxaloacetate as both a gluconeogenetic precursor and a potential substrate of pyruvate kinase, requires a bioenergetic push that consumes two ATP equivalents (one from pyruvate carboxylase and the second from PEPCK). This metabolism require a high energy state with elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP/ADP, GTP/GDP, and acetyl-CoA/CoA. During gluconeogenesis, the maintenance of glucose supply is contingent on preventing the energetically favorable hydrolysis of newly synthesized PEP back to pyruvate by the liver isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKL). Thus, regulating the balance between PEP synthesis and hydrolysis emerges as a potentially targetable determinant in the capacity to produce glucose and lipids. We hypothesize that, like beta cells, hepatocytes manage the balance between glucose/lipid/ketone production and oxidation via distinct mitochondrial functional states akin to state 3 respiration for OxPhos and state 4 for PEP synthesis. Furthermore, glucagon-induced metabolic oscillations provide a window into the phase-encoded metabolism that are observable at the single cell level referenced to changes in cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial membrane potential measurements. Approach: The phasic relationships of metabolites and mitochondrial membrane potential with Ca2+ signaling through a combination of time-resolved, perfused live cell, multimodal, dual-camera spinning disc confocal imaging and mass isotopomer tracing from hepatocytes and liver slices performed using existing protocols in the Kibbey lab. Mice lack hepatic PCK2 and are a particularly poor translational model for humans which, like rats, have abundant PCK2. 8-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats treated three weeks with twice weekly intraperitoneal liver specific conjugated anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) silenced control, PCK1, PCK2, or PKLR (IONIS Corporation) or oral pyruvate kinase activator (TEPP46). Fed and overnight fasted livers will be obtained from rats fed three weeks on regular chow or high fat/sucrose diet immediately processed and assayed. Continuous vs. pulsatile hormonal (e.g., glucagon or insulin) and nutritive (e.g., lactate/pyruvate, conjugated fatty acids, fructose) stimuli will be assessed with time resolved measurements below. 2.2 Aim 1: Single cell imaging of hepatic metabolic oscillations To avoid significant metabolic reprogramming unrelated to tested conditions, imaging and metabolism studies will be performed immediately following isolation. Cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ will be imaged using a transduced reporter such as FRCaMP and MityCam or a Rhod-2 dye sensors suitable for rats. Mitochondrial and cytosolic oscillations will then be imaged and mapped upon glucagon stimulation. PercevalHR, a probe of cytosolic ATP/ADP, and does not overlap with previously mentioned indicators and can be used simultaneously. 2.3. Aim 2: Impact of glucagon, insulin, and metabolites on oscillatory mitochondrial metabolism. Analysis will include quantitative measurement of glucose, ketone, urea, lactate, ketone production and clearance in media as well as mitochondrial respirometry to assess for mass balance relationships and mitochondrial function using established optical, enzymatic or LC-MS/MS in-house protocols.

Steady state as well as time resolved metabolic flux measurements will be performed in hepatocytes/slices will utilize Mass Isotopomer (MIMOSA) developed by the Kibbey lab and will use [U 13C3]-L-lactate, [U 13C6]-fructose or [1,2 13C2]-L-glutamine as separate tracers to assess for changes in key metabolic fluxes with emphasis on pyruvate carboxylase, PEPCK, pyruvate kinase, PDH, beta-oxidation, ACLY, and GDH contributions gluconeogenesis, de novo lipogenesis, ketogenesis. 2.4 Anticipated Results To our knowledge the phase-specific changes in oscillatory metabolism of hepatocytes in response to nutrient and hormonal signals occurring on the time scales relevant to in vivo islet secretion have not been previously reported. We anticipate that this will uncover the phasic relation of hepatic ATP/ADP, Ca2+, mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration, oxidative vs. anaplerotic metabolism, DNL, ureagenesis, and ketogenesis as indicators of consumptive vs. productive metabolism. We anticipate oscillatory entrainment in response to acute pulses of hormones and pyruvate kinase activators that will be dampened by either continuous hormone exposure in vitro or diabetic conditions in vivo but recovered by acute pyruvate kinase activation. Activation of pyruvate kinase is predicted to speed up oscillations, increase lipid oxidation, decrease DNL, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Since pyruvate kinase is important for inducing a hyperpolarized mitochondria from fructose, but also can contribute to a futile cycle, DNL is expected to be reduced with increased beta-oxidation while gluconeogenesis may be increased. The roles of PCK1 vs. PCK2 (together or independently) towards each of these processes will be clarified by the ASO silencing of the PEPCK isoforms. Importantly, the mechanistic explanation for why knockout of PCK1 worsens metabolic disease (increased steatosis, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia) and why PCK2 silencing improves it (decreased hepatic and circulating triglycerides, lower glucose production and diminished insulin resistance) will be clarified and may inform of new therapeutic targets. Liver mitochondria play a critical role in both the oxidation of substrates for energy production and the synthesis of compounds such as fats, carbohydrates, amino acids, and ketones for storage or export. This dual function requires a highly coordinated balancing act that responds instantly to meet the demands of consumption, storage, and distribution. The mechanisms enabling this rapid transition between catabolic and anabolic states—and the consequences of their dysfunction in the context of lipid accumulation or aberrant gluconeogenesis—are crucial areas for investigation. Unraveling the regulatory systems in play could unveil new targets for restoring metabolic equilibrium. These mitochondrial functions govern various aspects of fatty acid and carbohydrate management. It is metabolically inefficient for a cell to channel energy into synthesis processes while also experiencing an ATP shortfall. Similarly, in the absence of a balance between cataplerosis and anaplerosis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle would be disrupted, characterized by either a depletion or an excess. The classic perception of metabolic pathways functioning continue as independent entities must be revised to understand how the liver avoids futile cycling and manages seemingly incompatible metabolic fluxes. Current thinking posits that temporal partitioning of these fluxes via oscillations offers a robust regulatory mechanism. Evidence from pancreatic beta-cells, which exhibit metabolic, electrical, and secretory oscillations, supports this concept. These cycles temporally segregate glucose signaling and secretion phases, implying a possible parallel in hepatocytes, given the shared machinery for phosphoenolpyruvate generation and the pulsatile secretion of islet hormones influencing liver metabolism. Furthermore, islet hormone oscillations, which become disrupted in diabetic conditions, suggest a link to hepatic metabolic dysfunction seen in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). If liver metabolism is similarly orchestrated, elucidating these oscillatory patterns could inform novel strategies for metabolic intervention. This proposal seeks to decode the oscillatory cues that guide fatty acid storage, oxidation, and glucose production within liver mitochondria. Our hypothesis presents a model where hepatocytes rely on metabolic oscillations, shifting between oxidative phosphorylation and the synthesis of metabolic precursors to finely tune energy-related processes such as gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. Although under-investigated, emerging evidence, including glucagon-induced calcium signaling perturbations related to hepatic glucose output, suggests the presence of such oscillations, especially given their aberrations in pathological states like obesity and MAFLD. To further explore these phenomena, our objectives include examining these oscillatory mechanisms, their disruptions under nutrient excess as in MAFLD and diabetes, and their restoration via pyruvate kinase activation. We will dissect the interplay between metabolic cycles and calcium signals to identify intra- and extrahepatic modulators affected by nutritional overabundance. Our specific aims and research design include: Assessing the role of glucagon-induced hepatic calcium oscillations in gluconeogenesis: We postulate that hepatocytes, akin to beta cells, use metabolic states that favor either oxidative phosphorylation or the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate to regulate glucose, lipid, and ketone metabolism. These temporal metabolic states are likely encoded by metabolic oscillations that can be traced through single-cell-level fluctuations in cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial membrane potential. Single-cell imaging of hepatic metabolic oscillations: To prevent metabolic confounding factors, studies will be conducted immediately post-isolation. Imaging will use both probes and dyes specific to calcium within the cytosol and mitochondria, alongside other indicators for ATP/ADP ratios. Following glucagon stimulation, mitochondrial and cytosolic oscillations will be analyzed for their phasic interplay. Impact of hormones and metabolites on oscillatory mitochondrial metabolism: Through established in-house protocols and innovative techniques like Mass Isotopomer Distribution Analysis (MIMOSA), we will quantify nutrient fluxes and mitochondrial function. We aim to delineate the interactions of these oscillatory processes with varying hormone and nutrient signals and diagnose dysregulation under diabetic conditions. Anticipated results include characterizing phase-specific changes in hepatocyte metabolism driven by hormonal and nutrient signals on a relevant time scale. Positive outcomes include identifying regulatory phases that dictate metabolic health and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Activation of pyruvate kinase, for instance, is expected to modulate these metabolic oscillations beneficially, providing a possible avenue to counteract the metabolic disruptions observed in diabetes and MAFLD. The outcomes of PEPCK isoform manipulations will further illuminate their distinct roles in metabolism, offering insights that could transform therapeutic strategies.","completion":"The liver is an indispensable organ with a remarkable ability to balance its dual role in the metabolism and synthesis of multiple substrates, thus maintaining energy equilibrium within the body. This complex task is achieved by the liver\'s specialized mitochondria, which are adept at instantaneously switching between consumption and production processes to suit the metabolic demand. Dissecting the intricacies of this metabolic flexibility is not merely an academic exercise but a crucial step toward understanding pathological states like lipid accumulation, aberrant gluconeogenesis, and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). To illustrate, the liver mitochondria perform a juggling act, seamlessly transitioning between the oxidation of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids to generate ATP and the concurrent synthesis of these substrates for storage or systemic distribution. The mechanisms underpinning this responsive flux transition—particularly those processes inaccessible to transcriptional or translational regulation—are a pivotal area of scientific inquiry. Understanding these swift transitions and the pathological consequences arising from supply-demand mismatches bears significant therapeutic potential in addressing metabolic disorders. This proposal addresses the pressing need to unravel the spontaneous regulatory signals that enable such agile metabolic shifts. We posit that metabolic oscillations, a phenomenon demonstrated in the hepatocyte\'s pancreatic counterpart—the beta-cell—may play an analogous role in hepatic metabolism. Beta-cells exhibit cyclical patterns in electrical activity, metabolism, and insulin secretion, suggesting a similar temporal regulatory framework may exist within liver cells. These cycles help to parse energetically antithetical processes, such as the competing states of substrate consumption and production, aligning them within a temporal sequence to minimize wasteful cycling. Our hypothesis suggests that hepatocytes utilize mitochondrial metabolic oscillations as a refined control system, modulating the interplay among oxidative phosphorylation and the assembly of metabolic intermediates. This metabolic clockwork is an aspect of hepatocyte function that has been overshadowed and underexplored in existing literature. Nonetheless, our preliminary data and the well-documented role of glucagon in evoking calcium oscillations that are critical for hepatic glucose production posit a tantalizing connection between these oscillations and hepatocyte metabolic regulation. The overarching goals of this research are to probe the temporal dimension\'s regulatory impact on key hepatic functions—such as gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ketogenesis, and beta-oxidation—and to examine how derangements in these processes manifest under the conditions of nutrient overload typical of MAFLD and diabetes. Furthermore, we aim to uncover the restorative potential of pyruvate kinase activation in reestablishing metabolic order. The research design comprises several aims: 1. We will explore the ramifications of glucagon-induced calcium oscillations within hepatocytes and delineate their influence on gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and the broader metabolic landscape. Building on the existing paradigm established by the pancreatic beta-cell, we aim to decrypt the hepatic code wherein metabolic oscillations preside over the seamless coordination of glucose and lipid metabolism. 2. Employing both single-cell imaging and a suite of metabolic assays, we will map the oscillatory landscape of hepatocyte metabolism in response to both hormonal and nutrient stimuli. This exploration will involve advanced imaging modalities coupled with sophisticated metabolic tracing methods to capture the dynamic interplay between metabolites, mitochondrial membrane potential, and calcium signaling. 3. We anticipate that these investigations will elucidate previously unrecognized patterns of hepatocyte metabolism that are disrupted in metabolic diseases and that interventions such as pyruvate kinase activation can correct these disruptions. Clarifying the roles of key regulatory enzymes and metabolic pathways in this context will not only deepen our understanding of liver metabolism but also fuel the discovery of new therapeutic targets. By embarking on this scientific journey, we seek to shine a light on the understudied domain of hepatic metabolic oscillations and their potential to orchestrate a coherent metabolic response to the body\'s needs. The knowledge gained from this research promises to be transformative, offering novel perspectives and strategies to combat metabolic disorders that represent a growing global health challenge."},{"prompt":"revise this scientific NIH proposal on liver metabolism , make it more coherent and without shortening text, we can do it in multiple answers if you are restricted by number of words in each answer: Liver mitochondria must somehow oxidize fat, carbohydrate and amino acid substrates to make energy but at the same time they have to use this energy to synthesize products such as fat, carbohydrates, amino acids and ketones for storage or export to the rest of the body. The liver has specialized mitochondria that are hardwired to perform this balancing act that requires near instantaneous shifting between oxidation and cataplerosis/anaplerosis to accommodate dramatic swings the processes of consumption, storage, and supply. What then are the hardwired processes (i.e., not regulated at the transcriptional translational level) that have control in a time regime that allow this rapid switching between consumption and production and how does a mismatch between supply and demand leads to pathogenic accumulation of lipid or gluconeogenesis? Likewise, if we can understand how the system is controlled better, are there novel targets of metabolism that can restore metabolic balance? Steps in fatty acid and carbohydrate storage, synthesis, repurposing, and oxidation are all managed at some level by mitochondria. Conceptually, it would be disadvantageous for the hepatocyte divert energy away from oxidation towards a process that consumes both energy and substrates, if at the same time there were an ATP deficit. Likewise, if cataplerosis is not balanced by anaplerosis, then the TCA pool would either be drained or overfilled. It would be a waste to burn substrates at the same time they are synthesized. Metabolic pathways contributing to either synthesis or breakdown, are generally viewed as disconnected, individual processes occurring simultaneously. We propose that one way the liver evolved to solve these problems was by sorting incompatible metabolic fluxes into the time domain with oscillations that ensure robust regulation but that limit futile cycling. A model for a similar of regulation has been recently described in the pancreatic beta-cell which has electrical, metabolic, and secretory oscillations that occur every 3-5 minutes. These oscillations separate glucose signaling events, that require a high ATP/ADP ratio and are dependent on pyruvate kinase activity, into a ‘signaling phase’ while a subsequent ‘secretion phase’ includes membrane depolarization, calcium influx, and oxidative phosphorylation. In this manner, the ‘signaling phase’, that uses cataplerosis (mitochondrial PEPCK) and anaplerosis (pyruvate carboxylase) requiring high acetyl-CoA/CoA and a hyperpolarized mitochondria would otherwise be short-circuited during the ‘secretion phase’ by the consumption of the proton motive force and acetyl-CoA during ATP synthesis by OxPhos. While the beta-cell principally ‘prefers’ to oxidize glucose, there are many reasons to believe that a similar oscillatory mechanism regulates metabolism in the intact liver where 1) the same anaplerotic/cataplerotic mechanisms generating phosphoenolpyruvate are involved, 2) islet hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner into the portal circulation with similar oscillatory periods, and 3) islet hormones induce calcium oscillations in hepatocytes with a similar period. Notably, pulsatile islet oscillations are disrupted in diabetes and this loss of oscillatory metabolism could at least partially explain metabolic-dysfunction associated with MASLD. Finally, acceleration of islet oscillations by small molecule activators of pyruvate kinase improve insulin secretion, decrease gluconeogenesis, decrease hepatic and circulating triglycerides, and improve glycemic control. These findings beg the question of how energetically opposing functions that require or generate ATP from mitochondria are working in tandem and what regulates the shift between them? understanding oscillatory hepatic metabolism, whether intrinsic or entrained by islets, could offer novel insights and targets to improve metabolic health. This proposal aims to address this gap in knowledge by deciphering the oscillatory regulatory signals governing fatty acid storage, oxidation, and glucose production within hepatocyte mitochondria. We hypothesize that hepatocytes leverage mitochondrial metabolic oscillations, alternating between oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and the synthesis of metabolic intermediates - to regulate gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. Notably, while metabolic oscillations in hepatocytes remain largely uncovered, prior evidence has shed light on the effect of glucagon on evoking IP3R-mediated Ca oscillations, deemed indispensable for hepatic glucose production as well as intra-hepatic breakdown. Moreover, our preliminary data indicate that these Ca oscillations become aberrant in hepatocytes isolated from obesity and MASLD models, indicating a possible dysregulation of this system; however, how these oscillations orchestrate the metabolic fluxes in question is not fully understood. The overall objectives of this proposal are to investigate 1) how the time domain contributes to the reciprocal regulation of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ketogenesis, and beta-oxidation within hepatocytes and liver slices, 2) how the dysregulation of these processes under conditions of nutritional surplus, typical of MASLD and diabetes, and 3) how they are repaired by activating pyruvate kinase. By deconstructing the interplay between metabolic cycles and calcium signaling, we will identify critical intra- and extrahepatic regulatory control points that may become disturbed by nutritional excess.","completion":"Liver mitochondria are unique organelles presenting the remarkable ability to oscillate efficiently between the roles of energy production from the oxidation of fat, carbohydrate, and amino acid substrates and the biosynthetic tasks involving the production of the same substrates for downstream storage or systemic export. This exceptional orchestration allows the liver to instantaneously adapt to the dynamic metabolic demands of the body, a property attributed to a meticulously fine-tuned set of processes that operate beyond the purview of transcriptional and translational controls. This proposal seeks to dissect these inherently \'hardwired\' processes to discern how mismatches between metabolic supply and demand can lead to pathogenic outcomes such as lipid accumulation or excessive gluconeogenesis. A deeper understanding in this realm may unveil novel targets within metabolic pathways conducive to restoring metabolic harmony across systemic levels. The efficient management of steps in fatty acid and carbohydrate storage, synthesis, repurposing, and oxidation by the mitochondria aligns with an inherent need to avoid energy waste. For hepatocytes, expending energy on synthetic processes while simultaneously experiencing an energy deficit would be counterproductive, as would allowing a disconnect between cataplerosis and anaplerosis—leading to either an underutilized or oversaturated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. We propose that the evolutionary solution to this conundrum may lie in the temporal segregation of metabolic fluxes, facilitated by strategically timed oscillations that strengthen metabolic regulation and minimize unproductive cycles—futile cycling. A similar regulatory model is observable in the pancreatic beta-cell, which exhibits distinct oscillations in electrical activity, metabolism, and secretion, unwinding every 3-5 minutes. Here, metabolic phases segregate activities requiring different metabolic prerequisites—such as signaling events necessitating a high ATP/ADP ratio—from subsequent energy-intensive secretion phases. This structured cycle incorporates periods of intense cataplerosis and anaplerosis, which sustain a high acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential but are selectively insulated from the consumption phase by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). The liver, while predominantly metabolizing more diverse substrates compared to beta-cells, is suspected of harnessing similar oscillatory mechanisms to regulate metabolism, given the involvement of comparable enzymatic processes (such as those generating phosphoenolpyruvate), the pulsatile release of islet hormones influencing hepatic function, and the calcium oscillations these hormones incite in hepatocytes. Importantly, the perturbation of these regular oscillations is a characteristic trait in diabetes, implicating a potential link to metabolic dysfunction in conditions such as MAFLD. If liver metabolism is indeed rhythmically controlled—whether intrinsically or through signals propagated by islet cells—the discovery of these patterns could lead to innovative interventions to ameliorate metabolic health. The specific aims of this proposal are tripartite: first, to investigate how temporal factors underpin the reciprocal regulation of key metabolic processes within the liver; second, to scrutinize how these processes become dysregulated under the nutritional excess typical of MASLD and diabetes; and third, to determine the reparative potential of pyruvate kinase activation. By dissecting the relationships between metabolic cycles and calcium signaling, we aim to illuminate vital regulatory checkpoints both within and outside the hepatic context that, when disrupted by overnutrition, contribute to metabolic dysregulation. Thus, we hypothesize that mitochondrial metabolic oscillations serve as a critical regulatory mechanism in hepatocytes, alternately driving oxidative phosphorylation and the synthesis of metabolic intermediates. These oscillations are fashioned to modulate processes as fundamental as gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. While such hepatocytic oscillations remain largely unexamined, evidence of glucagon\'s role in prompting IP3R-mediated calcium oscillations offers an important starting point. These calcium oscillations play a non-negotiable role in hepatic glucose production and, as our preliminary data suggest, present aberrantly in hepatocyte models of obesity and MASLD, heralding potential systemic dysregulation. However, the operational dynamics of these oscillations within the hepatic metabolism context remain enigmatic. Through this proposal, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap surrounding the oscillatory cues that govern the energetic and synthetic pathways within hepatocyte mitochondria, potentially reshaping the therapeutic landscape for metabolic disorders."},{"prompt":"revise this scientific NIH proposal on liver metabolism , make it more coherent and without shortening text, we can do it in multiple answers if you are restricted by number of words in each answer: keep the language very scientific and accurate : revise this scientific NIH proposal on liver metabolism without shortening, make it more coherent and without shortening text, we can do it in multiple answers if you are restricted by number of words per comment: Liver mitochondria must somehow oxidize fat, carbohydrate and amino acid substrates to make energy but at the same time they have to use this energy to synthesize products such as fat, carbohydrates, amino acids and ketones for storage or export to the rest of the body.

Specific Aims and Research Design 2.1. Assess how glucagon-induced hepatic Ca2+ oscillations facilitate gluconeogenesis. Glucagon induces IP3R-dependent cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) oscillations within hepatocytes, deemed to be pivotal role in regulating hepatic glucose production and intra-hepatic lipolysis. Notably, these evoked oscillations are resemblant to the Ca oscillations observed in the canonical glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) pathway of beta cells. Recently, the Kibbey lab has reported a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-M (PEPCK-M)-dependent switch leading to the production of the energy-consuming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), to be integral in regulating beta cell calcium spikes and subsequent insulin secretion. Interestingly, diversion of anaplerosis into PEPCK-M was crucial to initiate and sustain the increased cytosolic Ca2+ and insulin release. Therefore, this data suggests that oscillatory phases of PEP generation and consumption prevent the futile oxidation of pyruvate during the signaling phase, which would otherwise short circuit the process. Phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis from oxaloacetate as both a gluconeogenetic precursor and a potential substrate of pyruvate kinase, requires a bioenergetic push that consumes two ATP equivalents (one from pyruvate carboxylase and the second from PEPCK). This metabolism require a high energy state with elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP/ADP, GTP/GDP, and acetyl-CoA/CoA. During gluconeogenesis, the maintenance of glucose supply is contingent on preventing the energetically favorable hydrolysis of newly synthesized PEP back to pyruvate by the liver isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKL). Thus, regulating the balance between PEP synthesis and hydrolysis emerges as a potentially targetable determinant in the capacity to produce glucose and lipids. We hypothesize that, like beta cells, hepatocytes manage the balance between glucose/lipid/ketone production and oxidation via distinct mitochondrial functional states akin to state 3 respiration for OxPhos and state 4 for PEP synthesis. Furthermore, glucagon-induced metabolic oscillations provide a window into the phase-encoded metabolism that are observable at the single cell level referenced to changes in cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial membrane potential measurements. Approach: The phasic relationships of metabolites and mitochondrial membrane potential with Ca2+ signaling through a combination of time-resolved, perfused live cell, multimodal, dual-camera spinning disc confocal imaging and mass isotopomer tracing from hepatocytes and liver slices performed using existing protocols in the Kibbey lab. Mice lack hepatic PCK2 and are a particularly poor translational model for humans which, like rats, have abundant PCK2. 8-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats treated three weeks with twice weekly intraperitoneal liver specific conjugated anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) silenced control, PCK1, PCK2, or PKLR (IONIS Corporation) or oral pyruvate kinase activator (TEPP46). Fed and overnight fasted livers will be obtained from rats fed three weeks on regular chow or high fat/sucrose diet immediately processed and assayed. Continuous vs. pulsatile hormonal (e.g., glucagon or insulin) and nutritive (e.g., lactate/pyruvate, conjugated fatty acids, fructose) stimuli will be assessed with time resolved measurements below. 2.2 Aim 1: Single cell imaging of hepatic metabolic oscillations To avoid significant metabolic reprogramming unrelated to tested conditions, imaging and metabolism studies will be performed immediately following isolation. Cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ will be imaged using a transduced reporter such as FRCaMP and MityCam or a Rhod-2 dye sensors suitable for rats. Mitochondrial and cytosolic oscillations will then be imaged and mapped upon glucagon stimulation. PercevalHR, a probe of cytosolic ATP/ADP, and does not overlap with previously mentioned indicators and can be used simultaneously. 2.3.

Analysis will include quantitative measurement of glucose, ketone, urea, lactate, ketone production and clearance in media as well as mitochondrial respirometry to assess for mass balance relationships and mitochondrial function using established optical, enzymatic or LC-MS/MS in-house protocols. Cytosolic and mitochondrial redox states will be assessed by the pyruvate/lactate and BHOB/AcAc ratios, respectively. Steady state as well as time resolved metabolic flux measurements will be performed in hepatocytes/slices will utilize Mass Isotopomer (MIMOSA) developed by the Kibbey lab and will use [U 13C3]-L-lactate, [U 13C6]-fructose or [1,2 13C2]-L-glutamine as separate tracers to assess for changes in key metabolic fluxes with emphasis on pyruvate carboxylase, PEPCK, pyruvate kinase, PDH, beta-oxidation, ACLY, and GDH contributions gluconeogenesis, de novo lipogenesis, ketogenesis. 2.4 Anticipated Results To our knowledge the phase-specific changes in oscillatory metabolism of hepatocytes in response to nutrient and hormonal signals occurring on the time scales relevant to in vivo islet secretion have not been previously reported. We anticipate that this will uncover the phasic relation of hepatic ATP/ADP, Ca2+, mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration, oxidative vs. anaplerotic metabolism, DNL, ureagenesis, and ketogenesis as indicators of consumptive vs. productive metabolism. We anticipate oscillatory entrainment in response to acute pulses of hormones and pyruvate kinase activators that will be dampened by either continuous hormone exposure in vitro or diabetic conditions in vivo but recovered by acute pyruvate kinase activation. Activation of pyruvate kinase is predicted to speed up oscillations, increase lipid oxidation, decrease DNL, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Since pyruvate kinase is important for inducing a hyperpolarized mitochondria from fructose, but also can contribute to a futile cycle, DNL is expected to be reduced with increased beta-oxidation while gluconeogenesis may be increased. The roles of PCK1 vs. PCK2 (together or independently) towards each of these processes will be clarified by the ASO silencing of the PEPCK isoforms. Importantly, the mechanistic explanation for why knockout of PCK1 worsens metabolic disease (increased steatosis, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia) and why PCK2 silencing improves it (decreased hepatic and circulating triglycerides, lower glucose production and diminished insulin resistance) will be clarified and may inform of new therapeutic targets.","completion":"Liver mitochondria are pivotal in orchestrating the delicate metabolic balance between substrate oxidation and biosynthesis within hepatocytes. They enable the conversion of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids into ATP for immediate energy requirements while simultaneously synthesizing these same molecules for storage or systemic distribution. A central question arises regarding the identity of the intrinsic processes capable of enabling the rapid switch between these energy-consuming and energy-providing states. The elucidation of such processes that govern mitochondrial fuel selection—independent of transcriptional and translational control—could provide insight into metabolic diseases, such as the accrual of hepatic lipids or unfettered gluconeogenesis, possibly uncovering novel metabolic targets to restore overall balance. Mitochondrial oversight of fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism encompasses storage, synthesis, repurposing, and oxidation, with a particular concern for energy efficiency. It would be metabolically imprudent for hepatocytes to funnel energy towards biosynthetic pathways under conditions of limited ATP availability or to allow an imbalance between cataplerotic and anaplerotic fluxes that would result in TCA cycle dysfunction. We propose that the liver\'s evolutionary strategy to mitigate such scenarios involves temporal orchestration—using metabolic oscillations—to adeptly regulate these pathways and avoid counterproductive substrate cycling. Recently, a regulatory model utilizing oscillatory control has been characterized within pancreatic beta-cells. These cells display metabolic, electrical, and secretory oscillations that segregate key metabolic processes by temporal phase. For instance, glucose signaling—depending on pyruvate kinase activity and thus requiring a high ATP/ADP ratio—takes place before the secretion phase, which mandates membrane depolarization, calcium influx, and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation. This phased approach precludes the interference of OxPhos with earlier metabolic events that rely on an elevated acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential. Given these findings, it is plausible that similar oscillatory mechanisms govern hepatic metabolism, as evidenced by shared pathways for phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis, the pulsatility of islet hormone secretion, and the induction of calcium oscillations. The disruption of such islet-driven oscillations in diabetic states correlates with metabolic dysfunction seen in conditions such as metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASHD). The hypothesis is that by exploring hepatic metabolic oscillations, either inherently present in hepatocytes or synchronized by islet hormones, novel insights into metabolic regulation may emerge. This proposal intends to decode the rhythmic signals that coordinate mitochondrial fatty acid storage, oxidation, and glucose production within hepatocytes. We advance the hypothesis that hepatocytes employ a cycle of metabolic oscillations, alternating between oxidative phosphorylation and the synthesis of metabolic intermediates, which fine-tune the homeostatic processes of gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. These oscillations, though largely unexplored in hepatocytes, have been implicated by the action of glucagon in evoking inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated calcium fluctuations vital for hepatic glucose output and metabolic regulation. Our preliminary findings demonstrate alterations in calcium oscillations in hepatocytes derived from obesity and MASLD models, suggesting potential systemic regulatory breakdowns. However, the direct influence of these oscillations on metabolic flux remains to be fully elucidated. Our objective is to elucidate how oscillatory timing contributes to the regulation of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ketogenesis, and beta-oxidation; how these oscillatory processes are dysregulated under nutritional excess typical of MASLD and diabetes; and how targeted activation of pyruvate kinase can rectify these oscillatory disruptions. Through this investigative lens, we aim to reveal key regulatory nodes within hepatic and systemic metabolic networks that are susceptible to nutritional overload. The specific aims and research design structured to address these hypotheses and objectives include: 1. Characterization of the impact of glucagon-mediated hepatic calcium oscillations on gluconeogenesis: We will investigate the role of glucagon as a regulator of hepatic glucose production and lipolysis via its ability to induce cytosolic calcium oscillations in hepatocytes. Building on paradigms established in beta cells, such as the reported effect of PEPCK-M on calcium dynamics and insulin release, we will analyze the significance of oscillatory PEP synthesis in hepatic metabolism. We will use a multimodal imaging approach, combining time-resolved, perfused live cell spinning disc confocal microscopy with mass isotopomer tracing, to examine the phasic relationships of metabolic intermediates and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Special attention will be paid to rate-determining steps of gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism, including the synthesis and degradation of PEP. 2. Single-cell imaging of hepatic metabolic oscillations: Using state-of-the-art live-cell imaging technology and specific fluorescent probes and sensors, we will visualize calcium dynamics within hepatocyte mitochondria and cytosol in real time. This approach seeks to unravel the complex interplay between calcium signaling, mitochondrial metabolism, and substrate fluxes. 3. Assessment of the influence of glucagon, insulin, and other metabolites on mitochondrial metabolism oscillations: Quantitative analyses across various metrics—glucose, ketones, lactate, and ureagenesis—will be performed using a combination of respirometry and mass spectrometry techniques. This aim is crafted to dissect the impact of hormonal and nutritional cues on the oscillatory metabolic patterns of hepatocytes. Anticipated results envision unveiling phase-specific hepatocyte metabolic responses to exogenous stimuli that are synchronous with in vivo islet secretion timings. We expect to delineate oscillatory entrainment patterns and their modulation by acute hormonal fluctuations, which may be impaired in diabetic conditions but potentially reversible through acute pyruvate kinase activation. The delineation of PEPCK isoforms\' roles in these metabolic cycles will advance our understanding of their contributions to disease states, thus informing potential therapeutic interventions."},{"prompt":"revise this scientific NIH proposal on liver metabolism , make it more coherent and without shortening text, we can do it in multiple answers if you are restricted by number of words in each answer: keep the language very scientific and accurate : Liver mitochondria must somehow oxidize fat, carbohydrate and amino acid substrates to make energy but at the same time they have to use this energy to synthesize products such as fat, carbohydrates, amino acids and ketones for storage or export to the rest of the body.

A model for a similar of regulation has been recently described in the pancreatic beta-cell which has electrical, metabolic, and secretory oscillations that occur every 3-5 minutes. These oscillations separate glucose signaling events, that require a high ATP/ADP ratio and are dependent on pyruvate kinase activity, into a ‘signaling phase’ while a subsequent ‘secretion phase’ includes membrane depolarization, calcium influx, and oxidative phosphorylation. In this manner, the ‘signaling phase’, that uses cataplerosis (mitochondrial PEPCK) and anaplerosis (pyruvate carboxylase) requiring high acetyl-CoA/CoA and a hyperpolarized mitochondria would otherwise be short-circuited during the ‘secretion phase’ by the consumption of the proton motive force and acetyl-CoA during ATP synthesis by OxPhos. While the beta-cell principally ‘prefers’ to oxidize glucose, there are many reasons to believe that a similar oscillatory mechanism regulates metabolism in the intact liver where 1) the same anaplerotic/cataplerotic mechanisms generating phosphoenolpyruvate are involved, 2) islet hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner into the portal circulation with similar oscillatory periods, and 3) islet hormones induce calcium oscillations in hepatocytes with a similar period. Notably, pulsatile islet oscillations are disrupted in diabetes and this loss of oscillatory metabolism could at least partially explain metabolic-dysfunction associated with MASLD. Finally, acceleration of islet oscillations by small molecule activators of pyruvate kinase improve insulin secretion, decrease gluconeogenesis, decrease hepatic and circulating triglycerides, and improve glycemic control. These findings beg the question of how energetically opposing functions that require or generate ATP from mitochondria are working in tandem and what regulates the shift between them? understanding oscillatory hepatic metabolism, whether intrinsic or entrained by islets, could offer novel insights and targets to improve metabolic health. This proposal aims to address this gap in knowledge by deciphering the oscillatory regulatory signals governing fatty acid storage, oxidation, and glucose production within hepatocyte mitochondria. We hypothesize that hepatocytes leverage mitochondrial metabolic oscillations, alternating between oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and the synthesis of metabolic intermediates - to regulate gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. Notably, while metabolic oscillations in hepatocytes remain largely uncovered, prior evidence has shed light on the effect of glucagon on evoking IP3R-mediated Ca oscillations, deemed indispensable for hepatic glucose production as well as intra-hepatic breakdown. Moreover, our preliminary data indicate that these Ca oscillations become aberrant in hepatocytes isolated from obesity and MASLD models, indicating a possible dysregulation of this system; however, how these oscillations orchestrate the metabolic fluxes in question is not fully understood. The overall objectives of this proposal are to investigate 1) how the time domain contributes to the reciprocal regulation of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ketogenesis, and beta-oxidation within hepatocytes and liver slices, 2) how the dysregulation of these processes under conditions of nutritional surplus, typical of MASLD and diabetes, and 3) how they are repaired by activating pyruvate kinase. By deconstructing the interplay between metabolic cycles and calcium signaling, we will identify critical intra- and extrahepatic regulatory control points that may become disturbed by nutritional excess.","completion":"Hepatocyte mitochondria are uniquely tasked with the simultaneous metabolism of diverse substrates, necessitating an intricate balance between catabolic reactions that oxidize fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids for ATP production, and anabolic reactions that synthesize these same molecules for storage or systemic circulation. These dual roles imply the existence of highly responsive mechanisms capable of rapid modulation, independent of gene expression, to meet the fluctuating energy requirements and metabolic outputs. A dysregulation in these processes could account for pathological states such as lipid accumulation or inappropriate gluconeogenesis. Understanding the inherent control mechanisms more thoroughly could potentially reveal novel metabolic intervention targets to re-establish metabolic homeostasis. The mitochondrial handling of steps in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism involves a sophisticated level of control to optimize energy usage. Energy-consuming biosynthetic processes become non-viable under conditions of ATP deficiency, and tight regulation of anaplerosis and cataplerosis is essential to maintain TCA cycle integrity. Thus, to avoid futile cycles of simultaneous substrate oxidation and synthesis, the liver must have adopted strategies to coordinate these opposing metabolic demands while conserving energy. Temporal orchestration of metabolic fluxes via oscillatory patterns has been proposed as a key evolutionary solution, allowing for efficient and effective regulation without substrate waste. Oscillatory mechanisms known to exist in pancreatic beta-cells, characterized by regular cycles of electrical activities and metabolic changes, provide a precedent for such temporal regulation. These oscillations enforce a partitioned approach to metabolism, where a signaling phase reliant on a high ATP/ADP ratio and dependent on pyruvate kinase activity precedes the secretion phase, marked by membrane depolarization, calcium entry, and oxidative phosphorylation. These distinct metabolic phases permit the discrete processing of anaplerotic and cataplerotic events that would otherwise be compromised during the ATP synthesis in OxPhos. By analogy, it is reasonable to surmise that hepatic mitochondria might employ a similar strategy when responding to physiological cues. The liver and pancreatic beta-cells exhibit commonalities in terms of metabolic processes and hormone-responsive behaviors, including the generation of phosphoenolpyruvate via both anaplerotic and cataplerotic pathways and calcium dynamics modulated by islet hormone secretion. Disruptions to such hormonal rhythms, as observed in diabetic conditions, suggest their potential role in the metabolic disturbances occurring in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The correction of these aberrant oscillations using agents such as pyruvate kinase activators leads to improved metabolic profiles, raising questions about the regulatory interactions between divergent metabolic activities dependent on mitochondrial ATP production. In this context, the objective of our proposal is to elucidate the mitochondrial regulatory oscillations that dictate fatty acid storage, oxidation, and glucose production in hepatocytes. Our hypothesis posits that hepatocytes adapt mitochondrial metabolic oscillations to control the flux between oxidative phosphorylation and synthesis of metabolic intermediates, thereby ensuring the correct balance between energy provision and consumption. Although these metabolic oscillations in hepatocytes have not been extensively documented, preliminary insights indicate that glucagon facilitates IP3R-mediated calcium oscillations, which play a pivotal role in hepatic glucose output and intra-hepatic metabolism. Perturbations in these calcium oscillations seen in obesity and MAFLD models may signal an underlying regulatory misalignment, the specifics of which remain to be determined. The proposal sets out to dissect how temporal dynamics govern the interplay of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ketogenesis, and beta-oxidation within hepatocytes and liver slices; how these dynamics become perturbed under nutritionally excessive conditions as seen in MASLD and diabetes; and how such imbalances might be corrected through the activation of pyruvate kinase. By interrogating the interconnections between metabolic pathways and calcium signaling, we aim to identify the essential intra- and extrahepatic regulatory controls that are vulnerable to the impact of nutritional overabundance."},{"prompt":"revise this scientific NIH proposal on liver metabolism , make it more coherent and without shortening text, we can do it in multiple answers if you are restricted by number of words in each answer: keep the language very scientific and accurate : 2. Specific Aims and Research Design 2.1. Assess how glucagon-induced hepatic Ca2+ oscillations facilitate gluconeogenesis. Glucagon induces IP3R-dependent cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) oscillations within hepatocytes, deemed to be pivotal role in regulating hepatic glucose production and intra-hepatic lipolysis. Notably, these evoked oscillations are resemblant to the Ca oscillations observed in the canonical glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) pathway of beta cells. Recently, the Kibbey lab has reported a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-M (PEPCK-M)-dependent switch leading to the production of the energy-consuming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), to be integral in regulating beta cell calcium spikes and subsequent insulin secretion. Interestingly, diversion of anaplerosis into PEPCK-M was crucial to initiate and sustain the increased cytosolic Ca2+ and insulin release. Therefore, this data suggests that oscillatory phases of PEP generation and consumption prevent the futile oxidation of pyruvate during the signaling phase, which would otherwise short circuit the process. Phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis from oxaloacetate as both a gluconeogenetic precursor and a potential substrate of pyruvate kinase, requires a bioenergetic push that consumes two ATP equivalents (one from pyruvate carboxylase and the second from PEPCK). This metabolism require a high energy state with elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP/ADP, GTP/GDP, and acetyl-CoA/CoA. During gluconeogenesis, the maintenance of glucose supply is contingent on preventing the energetically favorable hydrolysis of newly synthesized PEP back to pyruvate by the liver isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKL). Thus, regulating the balance between PEP synthesis and hydrolysis emerges as a potentially targetable determinant in the capacity to produce glucose and lipids. We hypothesize that, like beta cells, hepatocytes manage the balance between glucose/lipid/ketone production and oxidation via distinct mitochondrial functional states akin to state 3 respiration for OxPhos and state 4 for PEP synthesis. Furthermore, glucagon-induced metabolic oscillations provide a window into the phase-encoded metabolism that are observable at the single cell level referenced to changes in cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial membrane potential measurements. Approach: The phasic relationships of metabolites and mitochondrial membrane potential with Ca2+ signaling through a combination of time-resolved, perfused live cell, multimodal, dual-camera spinning disc confocal imaging and mass isotopomer tracing from hepatocytes and liver slices performed using existing protocols in the Kibbey lab. Mice lack hepatic PCK2 and are a particularly poor translational model for humans which, like rats, have abundant PCK2. 8-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats treated three weeks with twice weekly intraperitoneal liver specific conjugated anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) silenced control, PCK1, PCK2, or PKLR (IONIS Corporation) or oral pyruvate kinase activator (TEPP46). Fed and overnight fasted livers will be obtained from rats fed three weeks on regular chow or high fat/sucrose diet immediately processed and assayed. Continuous vs. pulsatile hormonal (e.g., glucagon or insulin) and nutritive (e.g., lactate/pyruvate, conjugated fatty acids, fructose) stimuli will be assessed with time resolved measurements below. 2.2 Aim 1: Single cell imaging of hepatic metabolic oscillations To avoid significant metabolic reprogramming unrelated to tested conditions, imaging and metabolism studies will be performed immediately following isolation. Cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ will be imaged using a transduced reporter such as FRCaMP and MityCam or a Rhod-2 dye sensors suitable for rats. Mitochondrial and cytosolic oscillations will then be imaged and mapped upon glucagon stimulation. PercevalHR, a probe of cytosolic ATP/ADP, and does not overlap with previously mentioned indicators and can be used simultaneously. 2.3. Aim 2: Impact of glucagon, insulin, and metabolites on oscillatory mitochondrial metabolism. Analysis will include quantitative measurement of glucose, ketone, urea, lactate, ketone production and clearance in media as well as mitochondrial respirometry to assess for mass balance relationships and mitochondrial function using established optical, enzymatic or LC-MS/MS in-house protocols. Cytosolic and mitochondrial redox states will be assessed by the pyruvate/lactate and BHOB/AcAc ratios, respectively. Steady state as well as time resolved metabolic flux measurements will be performed in hepatocytes/slices will utilize Mass Isotopomer (MIMOSA) developed by the Kibbey lab and will use [U 13C3]-L-lactate, [U 13C6]-fructose or [1,2 13C2]-L-glutamine as separate tracers to assess for changes in key metabolic fluxes with emphasis on pyruvate carboxylase, PEPCK, pyruvate kinase, PDH, beta-oxidation, ACLY, and GDH contributions gluconeogenesis, de novo lipogenesis, ketogenesis.","completion":"2. Specific Aims and Research Design 2.1 Assess the modulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis by glucagon-induced Ca2+ oscillations. The endocrine hormone glucagon is known to stimulate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-dependent oscillations in cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]c) within hepatocytes. These oscillations are fundamental in the modulation of hepatic glucose production and intra-hepatic lipolytic processes, exhibiting similarities to the calcium dynamics observed during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic beta-cells. Recent discoveries by the Kibbey lab have identified a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-mitochondrial (PEPCK-M) dependent pathway as crucial in this calcium-mediated signaling, ultimately affecting insulin release. The shunting of carbon flux through PEPCK-M emerges as an essential element in beta-cell calcium handling, underpinning the oscillatory generation and consumption of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) that averts the otherwise wasteful oxidation of pyruvate during the signaling phase. PEP synthesis from oxaloacetate—a pivotal gluconeogenic intermediary and substrate for pyruvate kinase—demands significant bioenergetic investment, consuming two equivalents of ATP (one each from pyruvate carboxylase and PEPCK). To sustain gluconeogenesis, a high-energy state characterized by an elevated mitochondrial membrane potential and an increased ATP/ADP, GTP/GDP, and acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio is required. Additionally, it is imperative to prevent the reverse hydrolysis of PEP to pyruvate by the liver-specific pyruvate kinase isoenzyme, PKL. The regulation of this delicate balance between PEP synthesis and degradation thus presents a targetable node essential for effective glucose and lipid bioconversion. We hypothesize that hepatocytes, akin to beta-cells, utilize discrete mitochondrial states—comparable to the state 3 respiration for OxPhos and state 4 respiration for PEP synthesis—coordinating gluconeogenesis and substrate oxidation. Moreover, glucagon-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations provide an insight into metabolically phase-locked events that can be monitored at a single-cell resolution, correlating with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and cytosolic calcium levels. Approach: Employing time-resolved, perfused, live-cell imaging with multimodal, dual-camera spinning disc confocal microscopy, and mass isotopomer tracing, we will delineate the relationship between cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, mitochondrial membrane potential, and metabolic intermediates in hepatocytes and liver slices. This analysis will leverage established protocols in the Kibbey lab. Due to their lack of hepatic PCK2 and limited translatability, murine models will be eschewed in favor of 8-week-old Sprague Dawley rats, a species that, akin to humans, expresses ample hepatic PCK2. These rats will undergo a three-week regimen of biweekly intraperitoneal injections with liver-specific conjugated antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting control conditions or specific genes such as PCK1, PCK2, or PKLR (IONIS Corporation), or treatment with an oral pyruvate kinase activator (TEPP46). Liver samples from both fed and overnight-fasted rats, maintained on either a regular chow or a high-fat/sucrose diet, will be obtained for immediate experimental processing. The impacts of continuous versus pulsatile hormonal (glucagon or insulin) and nutritional stimuli (lactate/pyruvate, conjugated fatty acids, fructose) will be assessed using time-resolved measurements. 2.2 Aim 1: Single-cell imaging of hepatic metabolic oscillations To circumvent artifactual metabolic changes unrelated to experimental conditions, single-cell imaging and metabolic characterization will proceed immediately post-isolation. Both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics will be visualized using genetically encoded indicators such as FRCaMP, MityCam, or the small molecule probe Rhod-2, all of which are tailored for rat hepatocytes. These live-cell imaging techniques will capture the oscillatory response of hepatocytes to glucagon stimulation, with PercevalHR—an indicator of cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio—being used concurrently without spectral overlap with the calcium measurements. 2.3 Aim 2: Impact of glucagon, insulin, and metabolites on oscillatory mitochondrial metabolism Quantitative assessment of the metabolites glucose, ketones, urea, lactate, and their rates of production or clearance will be conducted alongside mitochondrial respirometric analysis to determine overall mass balance and mitochondrial functional state. These analyses will utilize a suite of established techniques, including optical and enzymatic assays, as well as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To appraise the cytosolic and mitochondrial redox status, the ratios of pyruvate/lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate (BHOB/AcAc) will be measured. A combination of steady-state and dynamic metabolic flux analysis in hepatocytes and liver slices will be performed, employing Mass Isotopomer Distribution Analysis (MIMOSA) developed by the Kibbey lab. Isotopic tracers such as [U-13C3]-L-lactate, [U-13C6]-fructose, and [1,2-13C2]-L-glutamine will be used to dissect flux through metabolic pathways including pyruvate carboxylase, PEPCK, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), beta-oxidation, ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This approach will elucidate the regulation and contribution of these enzymes to gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and ketogenesis."},{"prompt":"revise this scientific NIH proposal on liver metabolism , make it more coherent and without shortening text, we can do it in multiple answers if you are restricted by number of words in each answer: keep the language very scientific and accurate : 2.4 Anticipated Results To our knowledge the phase-specific changes in oscillatory metabolism of hepatocytes in response to nutrient and hormonal signals occurring on the time scales relevant to in vivo islet secretion have not been previously reported. We anticipate that this will uncover the phasic relation of hepatic ATP/ADP, Ca2+, mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration, oxidative vs. anaplerotic metabolism, DNL, ureagenesis, and ketogenesis as indicators of consumptive vs. productive metabolism. We anticipate oscillatory entrainment in response to acute pulses of hormones and pyruvate kinase activators that will be dampened by either continuous hormone exposure in vitro or diabetic conditions in vivo but recovered by acute pyruvate kinase activation. Activation of pyruvate kinase is predicted to speed up oscillations, increase lipid oxidation, decrease DNL, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Since pyruvate kinase is important for inducing a hyperpolarized mitochondria from fructose, but also can contribute to a futile cycle, DNL is expected to be reduced with increased beta-oxidation while gluconeogenesis may be increased. The roles of PCK1 vs. PCK2 (together or independently) towards each of these processes will be clarified by the ASO silencing of the PEPCK isoforms. Importantly, the mechanistic explanation for why knockout of PCK1 worsens metabolic disease (increased steatosis, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia) and why PCK2 silencing improves it (decreased hepatic and circulating triglycerides, lower glucose production and diminished insulin resistance) will be clarified and may inform of new therapeutic targets.","completion":"2.4 Anticipated Results Our exploration into the phase-specific oscillations of hepatocyte metabolism in response to nutritional and hormonal cues aims to fill a significant void in the current understanding of liver metabolic regulation. The temporal alignment of these metabolic oscillations with in vivo islet hormone secretion patterns is a novel area of investigation, and we expect our findings to provide valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of hepatic metabolic processes. Specifically, we anticipate clarifying the phasic relationships between critical metabolic indicators, such as the ATP/ADP ratio, intracellular calcium concentration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and respiration rates. Additionally, we aim to distinguish oscillatory patterns associated with either oxidative or anaplerotic metabolism, de novo lipogenesis (DNL), ureagenesis, and ketogenesis, which may serve as biomarkers delineating consumptive versus productive metabolic states. In particular, we posit that hepatocytes exhibit an oscillatory entrainment that responds to acute hormonal stimulation and that this regulation can be influenced by the presence of pyruvate kinase activators. This response may be tempered by continuous exposure to hormones or altered metabolic states, such as those observed in diabetes, potentially reflecting a reduced adaptive capacity in these contexts. However, we hypothesize that the administration of acute pyruvate kinase activators may restore these oscillatory dynamics. The activation of pyruvate kinase is hypothesized to not only modulate the frequency of these oscillations but also to shift the metabolic balance toward an increased rate of lipid oxidation while simultaneously reducing DNL, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Given the role of pyruvate kinase in promoting mitochondrial hyperpolarization—especially in the context of fructose metabolism—but also its involvement in potentiating a futile cycle of substrate turnover, we anticipate that enhanced pyruvate kinase activity will lead to a net decrease in DNL concurrent with an upregulation of beta-oxidation, exerting a rebalancing effect on gluconeogenesis. Of particular interest is delineating the distinct contributions of the PEPCK isoenzymes, PCK1 and PCK2, toward these metabolic functions. Through targeted antisense oligonucleotide-mediated gene silencing, we intend to elucidate the separate and combined roles of PCK1 and PCK2 in the hepatic metabolic network. We aim to provide a mechanistic understanding of why PCK1 knockout exacerbates features of metabolic dysregulation—with increased hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia—and conversely, why PCK2 silencing appears to yield metabolic improvement—with reduced hepatic and circulating triglycerides, decreased glucose production, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Through these investigations, we expect not only to advance scientific knowledge regarding the dynamic regulation of liver metabolism but also to uncover potential new therapeutic targets. The implications of altering the expression and activity of PEPCK isoenzymes in the context of metabolic diseases could be profound, offering promising avenues for the treatment of conditions like MAFLD, type 2 diabetes, and their associated metabolic complications."},{"prompt":"revise:: This study will characterize metabolic oscillations of hepatocytes under different nutritional and hormonal cues and will utilize fatty-liver disease and type-2-diabetes animal models to further underscore the findings impact in whole organism models and potentially introduce novel therapeutic targets. This characterization is the first and necessary step to determine whether the development of novel drugs manipulating mitochondrial metabolic oscillations would be a feasible strategy to prevent hepatic steatosis and associated insulin resistance. While cell-line models will be used to calibrate our system, it poorly recapitulates primary hepatocytes physiology and metabolism. Furthermore, liver metabolism is complex and requires in vivo modelling, thereby understanding lipid metabolism rewiring by the liver, will require us tissue-specific and whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism studies in fat vs. fructose diets ± pharmological intervetions will be assessed under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions in rodent models (Pck1/2ASO, PklASO). Justifications and procedures: 1) Animal models and justifications: Whole mammalian organisms are required to recapitulate the changes in metabolism caused by diet-induced obesity, as these changes are the result of alterations in the hormonal status and in the functional interaction of multiple tissues, such as liver, White Adipose Tissue, Brown Adipose Tissue, heart, pancreas, muscle and the brain. This interaction between all these metabolic organs cannot be properly mimicked in cells in culture and/or co-culturing multiple cell types. Therefore, to test approaches to cure these metabolic diseases, a whole organism is needed. Technology to specifically delete our genes of interest in hepatocytes (eg PCK2) from a whole mammalian organism, which simultaneously resembles human (patho)physiology in terms of understanding the role of the gene under diet-induced obesity, is only available in rodents (Cre-LoxP technology or viral injection of siRNA/shRNA). Specific tissue deletion is required to understand whether the specific contribution of the gene in the studied tissue (liver, thereby tissue-specific deletion should be targeted as a potential therapeutic approach. Available hepatocytes cell-lines (hepatoma cell-line of HepG2 or AML12) have differentiation problems and functionally they are relatively far from the primary cells. The use of animal models is necessary in order to analyze all the biological interactions and relevant pathologies that non-animal models are not sophisticated enough to provide. mice as specicies lack hepatic PCK2, while it is retained in rats, this is an important enzyme for our studies, therefore, mice cannot substitute rats.

Fed and overnight fasted livers will be obtained from rats fed three weeks on regular chow or high fat/sucrose diet immediately processed and assayed via a Alabama R&D Tissue Slicer for 100 micron thick disks (3, 5, 8, or 10 mm diameter). In some studies continuous or pulsatile hormonal (glucagon or insulin) stimuli will be administered via an implanted Alzet pump providing the hormone. Other nutritive interventions will test the role of lactate/pyruvate, conjugated fatty acids and fructose. After hepatocytes isolation, imaging and metabolism studies will be performed immediately. The number of rodents required for primary hepatocytes isolations and in vivo studies is approximately 50 per intervention group. Every attempt will be made to minimize the potential for pain and distress during interventions. rodents with obesity-induced by high fat diet show insulin resistance and high glucose levels, but they never develop exogenous insulin dependency or severe diabetes. However, we will perform glucose tolerance tests, glycemia and insulinemia measurements that will allow to determine whether the rodents became severely diabetic. In the case that we find an animal with very high fasting glucose levels (500 g/dl) and very low insulin levels after glucose injection (<0.1 pg/ul), these animals will be euthanized. In addition, if diabetes occurs well before the glucose tolerance tests, it will be detected by a sudden loss in body weight, as it is recorded once a week in animals under a high fat diet. If the animal lose 10-15% of their body weight compared to the previous measurement, glucose and insulin levels will be measured in the fed state and if both are found within those limits, the animal will be euthanized. injections: We will observe for a few minutes for any adverse events (hunching, excessive grooming, bleeding, etc.) and 24 hours later for signs of abdominal swelling or generalized illness (peritonitis). If any are seen, we will euthanize the animal.","completion":"This study is poised to elucidate the metabolic oscillations of hepatocytes in response to varying nutritional and hormonal stimuli. It aims to integrate findings from in vitro experiments with disease models of fatty liver and type 2 diabetes in vivo to potentially identify innovative therapeutic targets. The initial characterization of hepatocyte metabolic oscillations is a vital preliminary step in assessing the viability of novel pharmacological agents designed to manipulate these oscillations to prevent hepatic steatosis and its attendant insulin resistance. Although cell-line models will be instrumental for preliminary system calibration, their limited capacity to mimic primary hepatocyte physiology necessitates a transition to in vivo models for a more accurate representation of complex liver metabolism. Understanding the rewiring of lipid metabolism by the liver necessitates an in vivo approach that includes both tissue-specific assessments and comprehensive examinations of whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism. The impact of diets rich in fat versus fructose, along with pharmacological interventions, will be evaluated under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions in rodent models employing antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting Pck1/2 and Pkl. Justifications and Procedures: 1) Animal Models and Justifications: Whole organism studies are imperative for reproducing the metabolic alterations associated with diet-induced obesity, which involves shifts in hormonal milieu and multifaceted interactions among organs including the liver, white and brown adipose tissues, heart, pancreas, muscle, and brain. These intricate physiological dialogues are beyond the mimetic capabilities of cell culture or co-culturing systems. Consequently, to explore curative strategies for metabolic disorders, a comprehensive organismal model is necessary. In rodents, we have the technological advantage of inducing tissue-specific gene deletions, such as hepatic PCK2, via the Cre-LoxP system or viral vectors for RNA interference. This tissue-specific approach is essential to unravel the contribution of the target gene in the context of diet-induced obesity and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of liver-specific interventions. Rodent liver cell lines, such as HepG2 or AML12, exhibit significant deviations in differentiation and functionality compared to primary hepatocytes. The use of rodent models is therefore indispensable for analyzing complex biological interactions and relevant pathologies in a more comprehensive manner. Specifically, rat models are preferred over mice as the former maintain hepatic PCK2 expression, which is an enzyme critical to our studies and absent in mice. Specific Procedures: Sprague Dawley rats will be subjected to a regimen of bi-weekly intraperitoneal injections of liver-specific conjugated ASOs against control sequences, PCK1, PCK2, or PKLR (provided by IONIS Corporation), or an oral administration of a pyruvate kinase activator, TEPP46. Liver tissues from both fed and overnight-fasted rats on regular or high-fat/sucrose diets will be harvested and immediately processed into 100-micron thick disks using an Alabama R&D Tissue Slicer. In selected experiments, hormonal stimuli (such as glucagon or insulin) will be delivered continuously or in pulses via an implanted Alzet pump. Nutritional interventions will explore the metabolic impact of lactate/pyruvate, conjugated fatty acids, and fructose. Post-isolation, hepatocytes will undergo immediate imaging and metabolic analysis. Approximately 50 rodents per intervention group will be requisite for primary hepatocyte isolations and in vivo experiments. Ethical Considerations: Every effort will be made to minimize pain and distress. Rodents on a high-fat diet may develop insulin resistance and hyperglycemia but typically do not become insulin-dependent or acutely diabetic. Standard monitoring procedures, including glucose tolerance tests and measurements of fasting glucose and insulin levels, will be employed. Animals exhibiting critically high fasting glucose levels (≥500 mg/dL) in conjunction with low insulin levels post-glucose administration (<0.1 ng/mL) will be humanely euthanized. Body weight losses exceeding 10-15% observed during weekly assessments may prompt an expedited evaluation of glucose and insulin levels, with euthanasia as a course of action if the animals display severe diabetic symptoms. Post-injection, animals will be monitored for adverse events such as hunching, excessive grooming, bleeding, or signs consistent with peritonitis. Animals presenting any such symptoms will be immediately euthanized to mitigate suffering."},{"prompt":"список всех возможных разрешений с соотношением сторон 16 на 9 начиная от нуля до разрешения 1280 на 720","completion":"Соотношение сторон 16:9 является широкоформатным и очень популярным в цифровом телевидении, компьютерных мониторах и мобильных устройствах.

OpenAI et d\'autres organismes pourraient mettre l\'accent sur l\'éthique et la gestion des transitions professionnelles. 6. **IA et éthique** : Les questions éthiques autour de l\'utilisation de l\'IA pourront être au premier plan de la recherche et du développement, ce qui pourrait conduire à une législation et à des normes plus strictes. 7. **Collaboration internationale** : Les entreprises comme OpenAI pourraient collaborer avec des institutions du monde entier pour relever des défis mondiaux tels que le changement climatique, les pandémies et la gestion des ressources. 8. **Transparence et sécurité** : Alors que l\'IA devient plus puissante, la sécurité et la transparence des modèles seront des problèmes cruciaux pour éviter les utilisations malveillantes et comprendre les biais des modèles. 9. **Accessibilité de l\'IA** : Les développements technologiques pourraient conduire à rendre l\'IA plus accessible et abordable pour des startups et des développeurs individuels. 10. **Synergie avec d\'autres technologies** : L\'IA de OpenAI pourrait s\'intégrer avec d\'autres technologies émergentes comme la réalité augmentée/virtuelle, la blockchain, et l\'Internet des objets (IoT), créant des applications encore inimaginables en 2023. Il est important de noter que cette liste est purement spéculative et que la trajectoire réelle d\'OpenAI ou de toute autre entreprise d\'IA pourrait être affectée par de nombreux facteurs inattendus, tels que de nouvelles découvertes, des changements réglementaires, ou des évolutions sur le marché."}]'),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},_={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],N={key:0},W={key:1};function O(i,e,l,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",_,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
