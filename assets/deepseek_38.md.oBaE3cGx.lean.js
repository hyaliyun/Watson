Down?\\" Korvo Roth BOT — Today at 2:14 PM \\"Whatever..\\" he sent out a blast from himself in all directions to flush out his location","completion":"As the dénouement of their battle approached, with the crowd on the edge of their seats, Chris's medallion necklace—infused with a mysterious energy—began to levitate, glowing with an intensity that mirrored his rising spirit. Crossing his arms in a defiant gesture, Chris unleashed his inner power, abruptly spreading his arms wide, dispersing the entrapment of stillness that bound him. The moment his feet touched the ground, Chris blurred into motion, his speed so supernatural it seemed as if he was bending the very fabric of space. Around the brooding figure of Korvo Roth, a mesmerizing spectacle unfolded: a sea of Chris afterimages, all echoing his movements, a chorus line of illusions that taunted Korvo's senses. \\"Am I above? Right? Left? Down?\\" Chris's voice echoed from all directions, an auditory mirage that matched the visual labyrinth now ensnaring Korvo. Korvo Roth, however, the stoic and unyielding force that he was, sneered at the parlor trick with disdain. \\"Whatever,\\" he grunted, his voice betraying the slightest trace of annoyance at the bright display. With a deep inward draw of his own latent ability, Korvo unleashed a surge of raw energy, manifested as a tempestuous blast expanding outward from his very core. The shockwave tore through the illusions like a scythe through wheat, disintegrating the afterimages and reaching for the true Chris. The crowd held its breath, the explosive force a clarion call to the impending end. Would the cunning dexterity of Chris be outmatched by the sheer, brute strength of Korvo's blast? Amid the dissipating mirages, the real Chris, who had anticipated such a move, caught the edge of the blast with a twist of his body, using the momentum to catapult himself upward just above the reach of the energy's embrace. Korvo, recognizing the fleeting shadow of his true opponent amongst the fading trickery, refocused his efforts. Eyes narrowed, he prepared for the next phase, knowing that this battle of wits and power was far from over. The medallion's light dimmed as Chris descended from his aerial evasion, his playful smirk returning. Their dance of cunning and force resumed, a testament to the thrill of the tournament, where mind and might forever intertwine in the spectacle of combat."},{"prompt":"\\"Wooh!\\" He caught the edge of the blast with a twist of his body, using the momentum to catapult himself upward just above the reach of the energy. (Chris should counter attack)","completion":"\\"Wooh!\\" exclaimed Chris, skillfully catching the edge of Korvo's blast, allowing the force to spiral around his agile form. The energy coursed through the air, but Chris harnessed its power, channeling it into a graceful twist that propelled him skyward, clear of the blast's full might. Suspended in midair, where the roar of the crowd seemed distant and the anticipation of the onlookers stretched time to a standstill, Chris plotted his counter. His eyes, now sparkling with the thrill of challenge, fixed upon Korvo Roth below. With the precision of an acrobat, Chris shifted his weight and went into a swift descent, turning his evasion into an opportunity for attack. His body coiled, and then he struck, launching himself down like a hawk into a dive. The arena watched in wonder as Chris, surrounded by a halo of his own momentum, aimed at Korvo with an expertly timed flying kick. Korvo's eyes widened momentarily, the sudden reversal catching even the stoic warrior off guard. Chris's foot connected — not just a single blow, but a succession of rapid strikes, each one delivered with the same level of control and finesse that marked his entire style. With a flurry of hits, Chris unleashed his mixup-pressure-based prowess, leaving Korvo little room to react and even less to read his next move. The impact reverberated through the arena, the symphony of Chris's martial dance reaching its crescendo through the rhythmic percussion of his strikes. As Chris landed lightly back on the arena floor, Korvo, still standing, was visibly shaken by the unexpected onslaught. The crowd erupted in cheers, their appreciation for the spectacle eclipsing the din of battle. Chris, with a nod toward his opponent, readied himself for the next exchange, his confidence unshaken, his medallion resuming its subtle, mystical glow."},{"prompt":"Chris BOT — Today at 2:20 PM \\"Wooh!\\" He caught the edge of the blast with a twist of his body, using the momentum to catapult himself upward just above the reach of the energy.

Korvo Roth BOT — Today at 2:22 PM He then sent out tendrils of darkness then starts to barrage him with his darkness arms","completion":"Chris let out an exultant \\"Wooh!\\" as his agility saved him yet again. He rode the wave of Korvo's energy, twisting midair and using the blast's momentum to propel himself into a position above his foe. For a breathless moment, he seemed to hover, defying gravity in a masterful display of aerial control. Then, like a comet, he launched himself downward, targeting Korvo Roth with laser focus and determination. Korvo Roth, ever the embodiment of stoic darkness, was already one step ahead. His eyes, which had been tracking Chris's every move, flared with shadowy energy. In a swift response, he summoned tendrils of darkness that snaked out from his form, writhing and alive with his own ominous power. As Chris descended, swift and precise, the arena was split between light and shadow. The tendrils leapt towards him, attempting to ensnare and halt his dive. Unfazed, Chris contorted his body mid-descent, weaving through the dark arms with the deftness of a swallow in flight. Then, continuing his attack even amidst the barrage, Chris kicked and punched through the shadowy limbs. Each precise hit caused the tendrils to dissipate like smoke, a testament to his ability to land decisive blows even against the formless dark. The crowd gasped and murmured with each near miss and successful strike, witnessing an aerial dance macabre. Bright flashes of Chris in motion contrasted starkly against the pitch-black attacks of Korvo Roth, making their showdown not only a battle of skill but a spectacle of contrasts. With a final acrobatic flourish, Chris broke through the last of the darkness, landing a solid hit on Korvo Roth, who took the blow with gritted teeth, acknowledging the hit but already preparing to unleash another wave of darkness. They stood, panting, gazes locked—a momentary quiet before the storm of their next engagement."},{"prompt":"fait moi une timeline hypothétique sur les avancées de L’ IA avenir jusqu’à AGI et puis ASI en matière de jeux vidéo et met les dates environs","completion":"Il est important de noter que toute prédiction concernant le futur de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) est intrinsèquement spéculative et incertaine, surtout en ce qui concerne la réalisation d'une IA de niveau humain (AGI - Artificial General Intelligence) et d'une superintelligence (ASI - Artificial Superintelligence). Néanmoins, je vais vous fournir une timeline hypothétique basée sur les tendances actuelles et les prévisions d'experts en IA. Notez que ces dates sont hypothétiques et pourraient varier considérablement en fonction du développement technologique, des financements, des réglementations, et des imprévus. **2023-2030: Amélioration des IAs spécialisées dans les jeux vidéo** - **2023-2025**: Les IA continuent de s'améliorer dans les jeux spécifiques, comme les échecs, Go et d'autres jeux de stratégie. Elles commencent à être utilisées pour générer des parties de jeux complexes (terrain, scénario) et pour personnaliser les expériences des joueurs en temps réel. - **2026-2028**: L'intégration des IA avancées dans les jeux vidéo devient la norme pour la création de personnages non-joueurs (PNJs) plus réalistes et des mondes dynamiques. Les systèmes de recommandation pour les jeux deviennent plus sophistiqués, offrant une expérience personnalisée et immersive. - **2029-2030**: Les premières IAs qui comprennent et intègrent de façon plus flexible et nuancée les émotions humaines dans les jeux apparaissent. Ceci permet des interactions plus profondes avec les joueurs et des histoires adaptatives. **2031-2040: Approche de l'AGI dans le domaine des jeux vidéo** - **2031-2035**: Des IAs peuvent maintenant concevoir des jeux vidéo simples sans intervention humaine. Leurs capacités créatives sont encore limitées, mais elles aident les concepteurs humains à itérer plus rapidement sur le design et le gameplay. - **2036-2038**: Des systèmes d'IA prédictifs et d'apprentissage en profondeur permettent de créer des expériences de jeu qui s'adaptent en temps réel aux compétences du joueur, offrant un défi toujours adapté et optimisé pour maintenir l'engagement. - **2039-2040**: Les progrès en direction de l'AGI permettent aux IAs de comprendre et participer à des jeux avec une complexité équivalente à celle d'un joueur humain moyen dans un large éventail de genres de jeux. **2041-2050: Naissance et développement de l'AGI dans le domaine des jeux vidéo** - **2041-2043**: Des prototypes d'AGI commencent à être utilisés pour des tests de jeux, où ils sont capables de jouer des rôles divers dans les simulations, de simulateurs de vols à des jeux de rôle immersifs. - **2044-2046**: Des assistances virtuelles basées sur l'AGI pour le développement de jeux permettent de réduire drastiquement le temps de production en automatisant de nombreux aspects créatifs et techniques. - **2047-2050**: L'apparition de l'AGI conduit à la création de jeux conçus par des intelligences artificielles pour des intelligences artificielles, ouvrant une nouvelle ère de métajeux et d'évaluation des performances des AGIs. **2051 et au-delà: Vers l'ASI et l'impact sur les jeux vidéo** - **2051-2060**: La transition de l'AGI vers l'ASI commence à se produire dans plusieurs domaines, y compris dans les jeux vidéo, bien que la date exacte de l'avènement de l'ASI soit hautement incertaine et controversée. - **2061-2070**: Une ASI dotée de capacités intellectuelles bien supérieures à celles des humains pourrait théoriquement créer des expériences de jeu extrêmement complexes et enrichissantes qui transcendent la compréhension humaine actuelle, ou bien choisir de ne pas le faire pour des raisons qui nous échappent. - **Après 2070**: Les avancées futures dépendent fortement des motivations et des objectifs des ASIs. Il est possible que les jeux vidéo tels que nous les connaissons n'aient plus le même sens pour une ASI, ou que des formes de divertissement inimaginables pour les humains soient développées. Cette timeline est largement spéculative et repose sur l'hypothèse qu'aucun événement dévastateur ou changement radical dans la recherche sur l'IA n'ait lieu. Les avancées en recherche fondamentale, les changements politiques, les crises économiques ou écologiques, ainsi que les avancées dans d'autres domaines tels que la neuroscience, pourraient avoir un impact significatif sur l'évolution de cette technologie."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

Ruth offers to do a relaxation exercise with her brother. She does not mention hypnosis. *Ruth* easily hypnotizes David into a deep trance using gentle techniques at first, stepping it up with overt fractionation as she continues.

DAVID lies sprawled on one armchair, casually flipping through channels. RUTH and her friend AIMEE are on the sofa, their bare feet tucked beneath them as they giggle over something on Aimee's phone. DAVID (Oblivious to the girls) Nothing on, as usual… RUTH Hey, David. You're always so wound up with your uni work. Why don't you try a relaxation exercise with me? David's brow raises skeptically, but he's clearly stressed and intrigued. DAVID Relaxation exercise? What, like yoga or something? RUTH (Grinning) Not exactly. Just close your eyes and listen to my voice, okay? Trust me. AIMEE sniggers from the corner but is curious enough to watch the interaction. David shrugs and complies, closing his eyes, leaning back into his chair. RUTH (Softly) All right, breathe in... and out. David inhales deeply and then exhales, his body language beginning to settle. RUTH (Continuing) Focus just on my voice and the rise and fall of your chest. With each breath, you can feel yourself getting lighter. Every muscle in your body is getting looser. David's breathing slows, syncing with Ruth's rhythm. RUTH Good. Now, imagine a warm light hovering above you. As I count down from five, it gets closer. Five... feeling calm. Four... even more relaxed. Three... letting go. Two... warm light drifting down. And one, it's here, bathing you in relaxation. David is visibly more relaxed, his face slack. AIMEE (Whispers, sarcastically to Ruth) You've turned your brother into a wet noodle, Ruth. RUTH (Chuckles lightly, ignoring Aimee) Now, David, with every number I say, allow yourself to sink twice as deep into this calm, peaceful state. We're going to go up and down, a bit like a lift. Ready? DAVID nods, beginning to succumb to the exercise. RUTH One, sinking deeper now. Two, up a little, but still relaxing. Three, much deeper now, let go. Four, coming up but it's harder, isn't it? And five, as deep as you can go, utterly relaxed. David's head tilts forward, his breathing even and deep. AIMEE (To Ruth, mockingly) Is he going to start clucking like a chicken now? RUTH gives Aimee a playful glance, then focuses back on her brother. RUTH (To David) You can hear Aimee's voice, but it only makes you smile and relax even more because you know she's just playing. Nothing disturbs this peace. David indeed cracks a brief, serene smile. RUTH (With more confidence) Every time you hear my voice say the word \\"relax,\\" you'll find yourself twice as calm, twice as peaceful. Relax. Deeper and deeper. David visibly relaxes further, his chest rising and falling steadily. RUTH And just like that, you can feel a sense of confidence that whatever stress you're feeling from uni, it's flowing out of you with each breath you take. You'll wake up when you're ready, feeling refreshed, but until then, just enjoy this tranquillity, okay? David murmurs in assent, the deep trance evident. RUTH turns to AIMEE with a triumphant grin. AIMEE mouths, \\"Wow,\\" clearly impressed despite her earlier teasing. RUTH (Tenderly, to David) You're doing so well. Whenever you're feeling overwhelmed, you can just imagine this warm light and my voice guiding you back to tranquillity. AIMEE snorts quietly, shaking her head in disbelief but with a newfound respect for Ruth's apparent skill.

Light novel genre: everyday life, school, romantic comedy. The main character is Rina Himura and she is a 2-C at Kaisei Secondary School student. Fate pits her against a mysterious player. This player was her classmate who, for unknown reasons, stopped going to school a year ago. Rina didn’t know her because she transferred after her classmate stopped going to school. This mysterious student was Konoha Misumi. There was another student in Rina’s class, Eiichi Uehara. He was always a loner and had no friends either among his classmates or in life. Rina never communicated with him like all other classmates. Unexpectedly for everyone, their homeroom teacher announced that Konoha Misumi was returning to school tomorrow. Please write detailed dialogues. Please describe Rina’s entire day from the very early morning from the moment she woke up until she returned home.","completion":"Title: Checkpoint Restart Chapter 1: The Mysterious Return Rina Himura opened her eyes to the sunlight streaming through her bedroom curtains, painting the room in stripes of gold and white. Yawning, she stretched her arms above her head, her thoughts already fluttering towards the day ahead. In many ways, it was just another day in her second year at Kaisei Secondary School, where life ticked by with the predictable rhythm of classes, club activities, and fleeting hallway conversations. As she dressed in her school uniform—a neatly pressed blazer and skirt—Rina pondered the peculiar sensation of \\"everyday life.\\" She was part of class 2-C, where everyone knew each other, at least by reputation or through brief exchanges by their lockers. Yet, it was only a superficial familiarity, a calm surface that rarely rippled. Breakfast was a solo affair, as usual; her parents had already left for work, leaving behind lovingly prepared sandwiches and a thermos of hot tea. Rina appreciated the quiet routine, yet there was a part of her that longed for something different, some kind of spark to ignite her daily monotony. She just never expected that spark to appear in the form of a long-absent classmate. The news broke as Rina walked into the classroom that morning, the chattering of her classmates bubbling around her like a noisy stream. \\"Did you hear? Konoha Misumi is coming back!\\" \\"The Misumi? I thought she moved away or something.\\" \\"Heard she was some gaming legend before she vanished.\\" As the snippets of conversation washed over her, Rina's curiosity piqued. She had no memories of Konoha; the mysterious girl had left before she transferred. But now, her absence felt like a void she had never noticed before, an unfinished story that demanded exploration. The school day trudged along in its familiar dance of lectures and notes. Rina couldn't shake her thoughts about Konoha, though. Who was she? Why did she disappear for so long? And why return now, after a whole year? During lunchtime at the rooftop, Rina sat with her friends, who were equally intrigued by the sudden news. Sandwich in hand, she listened more than she spoke, her thoughts drifting to the rumors like leaves caught in a current. \\"You think she was sick?\\" one friend mused, biting into her rice ball. \\"Nah, it's got to be family issues or something. That, or she actually became a pro gamer!\\" laughed another. Rina smiled faintly, wondering what the truth could be. The last class of the day was when their homeroom teacher, Ms. Tanaka, addressed the elephant in the room. \\"Class, as I'm sure you've heard, Konoha Misumi will be rejoining us starting tomorrow. I expect each of you to be welcoming and to help her readjust to school life.\\" Murmurs of excitement and nervous glances were exchanged among the students. But Rina's thoughts were distracted by Eiichi Uehara, sitting a few rows away from her, staring out the window with his usual disinterested gaze. She had tried striking up a conversation with him once, only to be met with a polite but firm silence. What a strange pair they were, Konoha and Eiichi, both enigmas in their own right. The final bell rang, and the students began to disperse, but Rina lingered, her eyes on Ms. Tanaka. \\"Ms. Tanaka,\\" Rina called out as the teacher packed up her bag. \\"Yes, Rina?\\" \\"About Konoha... is there anything else we should know?\\" Ms. Tanaka paused, a hint of concern in her eyes. \\"Just be kind and understanding. It's not easy to come back after so long.\\" Nodding, Rina felt her resolve deepen. She would be the first to welcome Konoha back, to show her the kindness she needed. The walk home was a solitary path of contemplation. Rina couldn't help but feel anticipation threading through her veins. Tomorrow was no longer just another day; it was a threshold, a checkpoint where life promised a restart, and she aimed to meet it head-on. As she climbed the steps to her house, her mind was a whirl of questions, plans, and possibilities. Would Konoha remember the school? Would she make friends, or would she need a guide? And what of Eiichi, the loner of class 2-C—would her return affect him, too? At home, Rina's homework was a mechanical process, her hands moving automatically as her mind raced ahead to the next day. She finished her studies, ate dinner alone, and prepared for bed, the moonlight now pouring through the windows and replacing the morning sun. The usual serenity of the night did little to calm her; if anything, it amplified her eagerness. Rina slipped beneath the covers, her eyes fixed on the ceiling until they grew heavy with the weight of sleep. In the haze of drifting off, she made herself a promise. Tomorrow, she would step beyond the outlines of her everyday life. Tomorrow, she would reach out to the mysterious Konoha Misumi. Tomorrow might just be the day her story, and perhaps the stories of her classmates, took a new turn. And as the world of dreams embraced her, she welcomed the unknown with an open heart."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue-filled chapter for a interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

Ichika, now residing under the identity of Orimura Ichika, glances at a glowing screen before him, reflecting on the upcoming meeting with the House of Einzbern. Unexpectedly, his senses alert him to incoming danger.** **Ichika (Naruto):** *(turns around swiftly)* Who's there? How did you get in? **Jiraiya:** *(steps from the shadows, a smirk on his face)* Surprised, Orimura-kun? Your old sensei hasn't lost his touch. *(gestures to the tracker on his wrist)* This little device here. You can thank the Sandaime for that. **Ichika (Naruto):** *(narrowing his eyes)* And what's the plan? Drag me back to the ruins of Konoha? **Jiraiya:** That's correct. Home is where you belong. It's time to reclaim what's ours and free the ninja world from the hands of these alien usurpers. *The Ōtsutsuki must be overthrown.* **Ichika (Naruto):** *(laughs heartily)* You're deluded if you think I'd go along with that. Konoha was never my home––not truly. And disbanding the shinobi farce has brought more peace to our world than the old ways ever did. *(Before Jiraiya can respond, the door blasts open. Ochako, Momo, and Kyoka, all wearing their sleek IS units, barge in.)* **Ochako:** *(brandishing her gravitational powers, eyes fierce)* Back away from him! You're not touching Ichika! **Momo:** *(readies her creation IS ability)* We've been trained for moments like these. Consider yourselves neutralized. **Kyoka:** *(hooks up her IS unit to her sound manipulation equipment)* Time to face the music. *(The girls launch themselves into a fierce and strategic battle against the Konoha restorationists. The room vibrates with the sounds of colliding technologies and clashing wills. Within moments, the restorationists are subdued, lying dazed on the floor.)* **Ichika (Naruto):** *(shaking his head, taking out his phone)* I suppose it's time to call the authorities. These misguided souls need a reality check––and perhaps some new lodgings. **Ochako:** *(smiling, despite the adrenaline)* Always action-packed around you, huh, Ichika? **Momo:** *(nodding in agreement)* The world's quite different now. But we're here... all of us, together. **Kyoka:** And we'll keep the symphony of war at bay. Together. **Ichika (Naruto):** *(glancing at the trio, a smirk playing on his face)* Together it is. Let's clean this mess up before my next strategy meeting. *(As they bound the intruders and wait for the authorities, the gravity of their new world––one that blends shinobi with Butei, IS pilots, and international struggles––settles around them. But amid the chaos of their multifaceted existence, Ichika and his allies stand as a beacon of forged unity, ready to confront the unknown ellipses of their grand, cosmic opera.)* --- **End of Scene** In this dialogue, the complex intertwining of various storylines and character motivations attempts to create a unified narrative that captures the intensity and dynamism of the crossover. However, to fully embrace the magnitude of the crossover described would indeed require a far more expansive exploration beyond the scope of a single scene or dialogue exchange."},{"prompt":"Est t il vrai que la guerre froide est une guerre de convention ?","completion":"Non, l'expression \\"guerre de convention\\" n'est pas correcte dans le contexte de la Guerre froide. L'expression appropriée pour décrire la Guerre froide est \\"guerre idéologique\\" ou \\"conflit géopolitique\\". La Guerre froide était une période de tension et d'hostilité prolongée principalement entre les États-Unis et leurs alliés d'un côté, et l'Union soviétique et ses alliés de l'autre, qui a duré de la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale à 1991. La caractéristique principale de la Guerre froide était qu'elle n'a pas évolué en un conflit armé direct à grande échelle entre les deux superpuissances, en raison notamment de la dissuasion nucléaire. Cela a conduit à l'utilisation de \\"guerres par procuration\\", où les deux superpuissances soutenaient des côtés opposés dans d'autres conflits régionaux comme ceux en Corée, en Vietnam, et en Afghanistan. Une \\"guerre de convention\\" suggérerait une série d'accords ou de règles acceptées régissant le conflit, ce qui ne décrit pas précisément la dynamique de la Guerre froide.

Ruth offers to do a relaxation exercise with her brother. She does not mention hypnosis. Ruth easily hypnotizes David into a deep trance using gentle techniques at first, stepping it up with overt fractionation as she continues. Aimee only chips in to mock him.

LIVING ROOM - EVENING The light from the TV illuminates the otherwise dimly lit room. DAVID, a dishevelled, easygoing university student, lounges on an armchair, his attention partially on the show while typing away on his laptop. His younger sister, RUTH, and her friend, AIMEE, are seated on the sofa opposite him. The charming lack of sophistication in the room gives away a comfortable and lived-in vibe. The two girls are giggling and whispering, their bare feet tucked under them. RUTH, looking over at David, tilts her head and offers a playful smile. RUTH Hey, Dave, you look a bit wound up from your study sesh. Fancy a quick chill out? I read about this relaxation thing that's supposed to be amazing. David looks at her skeptically but intrigued. He closes his laptop with a sigh and turns to face her more directly. DAVID Eh, yeah, why not? Could use a break from the books anyway. Ruth sits up straight, her demeanor subtly changes to a more soothing, calm posture intuitively adopting a tone that feels naturally persuasive. RUTH Okay, just get comfortable and focus on the sound of my voice. Take a slow, deep breath in for me... and let it out. That’s it. With every breath you take, feel yourself becoming more and more relaxed. David inhales deeply, seemingly starting to let his guard down. Aimee watches with a smirk, not quite buying into the idea. AIMEE (mocking) Watch out, Dave, you might just float away. Despite the comment, David's eyes start to flutter a tad, a sign of his growing relaxation. RUTH (ignoring Aimee) That’s good, David, you’re doing really well. Just keep focusing on my voice and the feeling of the cushions supporting you. Every time you hear Aimee’s voice, it just makes you feel more at ease, as if her scepticism is confirmation that you're really letting go... David breathes out slowly, his face expressing the relief of someone slipping into a deeper state of relaxation. RUTH (CONT'D) Can you feel your eyelids getting heavy, David? They want to close. It’s perfectly okay to let them. Aimee scoffs lightly but watches with rising interest as David complies, his eyelids closing gently. AIMEE No way, is he actually falling for this? David's breathing steadies and deepens, unbothered by Aimee's tone. RUTH (soothingly) It’s not about ‘falling for it’, Aimee... every chuckle, every doubt from you, it just helps David relax even more. That’s right, David, it just sends you deeper and deeper. You're doing brilliantly. David's head lolls slightly forward, his entire body language signalling surrender to the comfortable state he is in. RUTH (CONT'D) Now, David, I want you to imagine yourself taking a step down a beautiful staircase each time I say the word ‘down’. With every step, you feel more relaxed, more at peace… Down… Down… Deeper and deeper… David seems to be in a state of serene compliance, Ruth's control of the situation evident through her steady, confident tone. AIMEE (whispers, to Ruth) Holy crap, he's totally out. Ruth nods, a skilled and knowing calm in her eyes. RUTH Every time you go down, you relax more.

Tarjanov algoritam je postupak za pronalaženje snažno (ili jako) povezanih komponenti u usmjerenom grafu. Snažno povezana komponenta je podskup čvorova takav da postoji put između svaka dva čvora unutar te komponente. Algoritam je objavljen 1972. godine i predstavlja klasičan primjer efikasnog grafovskog algoritma. Njegova vremenska složenost je O(V + E), gdje je V broj čvorova, a E broj bridova u grafu, što znači da je vrlo efikasan za praktičnu upotrebu. Evo osnovne ideje kako algoritam funkcioniše: 1. Čvorovi grafa se posjećuju koristeći DFS (Depth-First Search, Pretraga u dubinu). Za svaki čvor, pamti se njegov indeks posjete i najniži indeks iz njega dostižnog čvora (low-link value). Indeks posjete označava redoslijed u kojem su čvorovi otkriveni, a najniži indeks očuvan je kako bi se identificirao \\"root\\" snažno povezane komponente. 2. Kako DFS prolazi kroz graf, svaki put kad se posjeti novi cvor, stavlja ga se na stog. Sve dok nismo završili s pregledom nekog čvora i svih njegovih susjeda, postoji mogućnost da je taj čvor dio veće snažno povezane komponente. 3. Nakon što se pregledaju svi potomci nekog čvora, ako je trenutni čvor \\"root\\" svoje snažno povezane komponente (što znači da njegov indeks posjete i njegov najniži indeks su jednaki), tada se elementi izvlače sa stoga sve dok ne dođemo do tog korjenskog čvora. Svi izvučeni čvorovi čine jednu snažno povezanu komponentu. 4. Algoritam se nastavlja s neposjećenim čvorovima dok se cijeli graf ne obradi i sve snažno povezane komponente identificiraju. Rezultat Tarjanovog algoritma je podjela čvorova grafa u skupove koji predstavljaju snažno povezane komponente. Ovo može biti korisno u mnogim primjenama, uključujući analizu društvenih mreža, dizajn kompajlera i analizu povezanosti web stranica na internetu."},{"prompt":"what is a better algoeithm to generate lotto numbers that can increase your chances for a win","completion":"As of my last update, there is no algorithm that can increase your chances of winning a lottery that is purely random, such as Lotto. Lotto numbers are drawn in a random fashion, and each number has an equal chance of being selected. In a truly random game, there is no way to predict which numbers will come up and no pattern to the numbers selected. However, there are strategies to potentially maximize winnings or increase the chance of not sharing a jackpot if you do happen to win, but none will actually increase the probability of winning itself: 1. Avoid common numbers or patterns: Many players select numbers that are significant to them, such as birthdays or anniversaries. Since most of these dates fall between 1 and 31, choosing numbers above 31 may reduce the likelihood that you will have to share the prize if you win, since fewer individuals may have picked those numbers. 2. Avoid consecutive numbers: Consecutive numbers or obvious patterns (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are often overplayed. 3. Use Quick Picks: Since Quick Picks are randomly generated, they are as likely to win as any set of numbers you might pick, and they tend to be more random than human-selected numbers. 4. Pool your tickets: More tickets mean more chances to win. Form a lottery pool with friends, family, or colleagues to purchase a larger number of tickets. Remember, this doesn't increase individual odds, but it does increase the odds for the pool as a whole while also dividing the potential prize. 5. Play less popular lottery games: Some suggest playing games with fewer players or less popular ones, where you might have a higher chance to win smaller prizes compared to over-subscribed games. Remember that the lottery is fundamentally a game of chance, and the odds of winning major lotteries are extremely low for any individual ticket. The only surefire way to increase your odds of winning is to purchase more tickets, but this also increases the cost and does not guarantee a win. For most people, the lottery should be considered as entertainment rather than a genuine investment or a reliable way to make money. Always gamble responsibly and within your financial means."},{"prompt":"are there better quality quick pick algorithms that one can use","completion":"There is no differentiation in quality among Quick Pick algorithms when it comes to the likelihood of winning a lottery because by design, they all offer random numbers without giving any particular advantage to the player. Quick Pick systems used by official lottery vendors are tested to ensure fairness and randomness. Consequently, one Quick Pick is as good as another in terms of your chances of winning. Here's what you should know about Quick Picks: 1. **Randomness**: The algorithms used for Quick Picks are designed to produce sets of numbers with no discernible pattern and equal likelihood of being drawn. They use a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to ensure that the numbers appear random. 2. **No Predictive Advantage**: There is no algorithm that can consider past draws or other factors to increase the odds of winning because the draws are independent events. Each draw is random and has the same odds for every number every time. 3. **Equal Chances**: The odds of winning with a Quick Pick are the same as the odds of winning with a set of numbers that a player chooses manually. The advantage of Quick Picks is that it prevents bias in number selection and ensures a diverse selection of numbers, which prevents players from clumping around popular choices like birthdays and anniversaries. 4. **Different Implementations**: While the concept behind Quick Pick algorithms is universally the same, different lottery commissions or software providers might implement their PRNGs differently, but this does not affect the quality pertaining to your chances of winning. If you prefer to have Quick Pick numbers but don't want to use the lottery terminal's algorithm, you can use reputable online random number generators or even create your own simple random number generator program to select your lottery numbers. However, this is for personal satisfaction only; it doesn't offer any statistical advantage. Lastly, the best approach to using Quick Picks or any lottery number selection method is to set a budget, play responsibly, and remember that the lottery should be considered a form of entertainment rather than a serious way to invest or make money."},{"prompt":"is there an algorithm that has a better quality than pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)","completion":"Yes, in terms of randomness and unpredictability, true random number generators (TRNGs) are generally considered superior to pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). The key differences between PRNGs and TRNGs are: 1. **Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs):** - PRNGs generate numbers that appear random and have certain random-like statistical properties. - They use algorithms to produce sequences of numbers, which means that the process is deterministic and ultimately predictable if one knows the algorithm and its initial state (the seed). - Once seeded, PRNGs produce the same sequence of 'random' numbers, which is good for simulations and scenarios where reproducibility is important. - PRNGs are faster and don't require an external source of randomness. - Examples include the Mersenne Twister, Linear Congruential Generators, and Xorshift. 2. **True Random Number Generators (TRNGs):** - TRNGs generate numbers based on a physically random process, such as thermal noise, radioactive decay, or quantum phenomena. - They are non-deterministic, as they do not rely on algorithms but rather on physical processes that are inherently unpredictable. - TRNGs do not produce the same sequence even with the same starting conditions, as they do not have a seed in the same way PRNGs do. - TRNGs are typically slower and can be more complex to build because they require a physical process to acquire randomness. - Examples include hardware random-number generators that measure quantum fluctuations or use electronic noise. For applications like cryptography and security, TRNGs are favored because they offer more robust unpredictability, which is critical for encryption keys and secure random processes. However, in the context of a lottery or a game where fair play and unpredictability are essential, TRNGs are not generally used since PRNGs are sufficient for this purpose. Lotteries rely on fair and tested systems to maintain public trust, and PRNGs, when properly implemented and audited, are random enough for lottery draws. Furthermore, the rate at which lotteries occur typically does not necessitate the more expensive and involved TRNGs. It's worth noting that no algorithm, whether based on PRNGs or TRNGs, can increase the chance of predicting or winning a random lottery draw. The nature of a lottery's randomness ensures that every number combination has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of the method by which the numbers are generated."},{"prompt":"Напиши и опиши все кадры к этому трейлеру : Если бы я создавал трейлер к первой книге серии “Коты-воители” (Warriors), которая называется “Стань диким” (“Into the Wild”), он был бы динамичным и захватывающим, чтобы привлечь внимание как фанатов книжной серии, так и новых зрителей.

I'm looking for ideas of things to buy that don't spoil quickly and can be made in small portions for one individual.","completion":"When shopping for easy meals that don't spoil quickly and can be made in small portions, consider ingredients that are either non-perishable or have a long shelf life, along with items that can be frozen or used in multiple ways. Here are some meal ideas and items you might want to pick up: 1. **Pasta and Jarred Sauce**: Pasta is a staple that keeps well in your pantry. Get a jar of your favorite pasta sauce, and you have a quick meal. You can also get some parmesan cheese for topping. 2. **Canned Beans and Rice**: Both canned beans and rice have long shelf lives and can be combined for a simple protein-rich meal. Rice can be cooked in small amounts, and you can use part of a can of beans, refrigerating the rest for later use. 3. **Frozen Vegetables**: Buy a variety of frozen vegetables. They’re easy to portion out and can be quickly steamed, sautéed, or microwaved. 4. **Frozen Chicken Breasts or Thighs**: These can be defrosted and cooked as needed. They can be seasoned in various ways and added to salads, pasta, or rice. 5. **Eggs**: Eggs last a good while in the fridge and can be used for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Make an omelette, scrambled eggs, or a fried egg sandwich. 6. **Canned Tuna or Salmon**: Canned fish is protein-packed, lasts a long time, and can be used in salads, sandwiches, or pastas. 7. **Long-Lasting Vegetables**: Some fresh vegetables last longer than others. Consider carrots, cabbage, sweet potatoes, onions, and garlic, which can add freshness to meals without spoiling quickly. 8. **Wraps or Tortillas**: These are versatile and can be used for sandwiches, burritos, or personal-sized pizzas. They also tend to last longer than bread. 9. **Pre-Made Soups**: Look for cartons or cans of soup. They come in single servings or can be refrigerated after opening if in larger containers. 10. **Sturdy Greens**: Kale and spinach can be used fresh in salads or cooked in stir-fries or pastas. They also freeze well if you can’t use them up quickly. 11. **Quinoa or Couscous**: Both of these grains cook quickly, work well in small portions, and can be stored dry for a long time. 12. **Bread (To Freeze)**: If you love bread but can’t go through it quickly, buy a loaf and freeze it, taking out slices as needed. 13. **Frozen Fruits**: These can be used for smoothies or desserts and are portion-friendly. 14. **Cheese**: Hard cheeses like cheddar, Swiss, or Parmesan have a long fridge life if stored properly. 15. **Instant Oatmeal**: Great for quick breakfasts, and you can add nuts, honey, or frozen fruit for variety. 16. **Nuts and Seeds**: They are a great source of healthy fats and protein, and they last a long time in the pantry. When shopping, consider versatility and shelf life to minimize waste and maximize your options. Many ingredients can be used in multiple recipes, so you don't get bored eating the same meal repeatedly. Finally, look for single-serve packages or consider dividing bulk items into smaller portions when you get home for easier use later."},{"prompt":"is there an algorithm that can predict or analyse pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) patters","completion":"Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are designed to produce sequences of numbers that simulate properties of random sequences. A well-constructed PRNG aims to pass various statistical tests for randomness, making it difficult to distinguish from a truly random sequence. However, no PRNG is truly random; they are deterministic algorithms that generate sequences from an initial value called a seed. Given the same seed and PRNG algorithm, the sequence of numbers will always be the same. This property is indeed exploited in various contexts where reproducibility is necessary, such as in simulations, testing, and debugging. Because PRNGs are deterministic, if you know the algorithm and the internal state (which includes the seed), you can predict the entire sequence of numbers. In fact, cracking PRNGs by reconstructing their state or finding patterns in their output is a field of study in both cryptography and various mathematical disciplines. Several approaches exist to analyze and predict PRNG patterns: 1. **Cryptanalysis**: This is the study of cryptographic systems with the aim of understanding how they work and finding weaknesses. For PRNGs used in cryptography (CSPRNGs, for cryptographic secure pseudo-random number generators), cryptanalysts work to find ways to predict future output without knowing the seed. If a CSPRNG is weak, it could be vulnerable to such analyses. 2. **Reverse Engineering**: Understanding the algorithm and internal workings of a PRNG makes it possible to predict its output. If you can replicate the internal state at any point, you can predict all subsequent values. 3. **Statistical Analysis**: This involves running statistical tests against the output of a PRNG to look for patterns or anomalies that should not exist in a truly random sequence. If patterns are detected, it can hint at flaws in the PRNG. 4. **Randomness Tests**: There are suites of tests, like the Diehard tests and the NIST Statistical Test Suite, designed to stress-test PRNG outputs to ensure they meet statistical properties of randomness. If a PRNG fails these tests, it may indicate a pattern or structure that can be exploited. 5. **Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition**: Advanced machine learning algorithms might be used to find patterns in data that are not immediately apparent. However, the effectiveness of such methods would significantly depend on the quality of the PRNG. A strong PRNG should not exhibit any patterns that these methods can exploit. It's important to note that the strength of a PRNG is based on how well it resists these types of analyses. A strong PRNG should not display any discernible patterns or predictable structures, and predicting its output should not be feasible without knowing the internal state. If a PRNG is weak and displays patterns, then it's not suitable for most cryptographic applications and possibly other applications where high-quality randomness is crucial."},{"prompt":"are there better generators than pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)","completion":"Alternative random number generators exist that offer various advantages over traditional pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), some aiming for better randomness, unpredictability, or performance for specific tasks. Here are a few alternatives and improvements over standard PRNGs: 1. **Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators (CSPRNGs)**: CSPRNGs are designed to meet the higher security standards required in cryptographic applications. They are more complex and have more stringent requirements than regular PRNGs, including: - Unpredictability: It should be computationally infeasible to predict future output based on past or present output. - Forward secrecy: Even if the current state is compromised, previous numbers generated should remain secure. Examples include Fortuna, Yarrow, and the algorithms based on block ciphers or hash functions like AES-CTR or SHA-based generators. 2. **Hardware Random Number Generators (HRNGs) or True Random Number Generators (TRNGs)**: These rely on physical processes to produce randomness, such as electronic noise, radioactive decay, or other quantum phenomena. They are considered non-deterministic and provide true random numbers as opposed to the pseudo-random numbers generated by PRNGs. However, they tend to be slower and more expensive to implement than PRNGs. They are often used in cryptographic applications for key generation or other areas where high-quality randomness is crucial. 3. **Quasi-Random Number Generators (QRNGs) or Low-Discrepancy Sequences**: These are used primarily in areas such as numerical simulation and financial modeling (e.g., the Monte Carlo method). Unlike PRNGs that aim to mimic true randomness, QRNGs are designed to produce sequences that cover the target space more uniformly. They can lead to faster convergence in numerical simulations but do not possess the unpredictability of PRNGs or TRNGs. 4. **Quantum Random Number Generators (Quantum RNGs)**: Leveraging principles of quantum mechanics, quantum RNGs generate random numbers based on fundamentally random quantum processes, such as photon polarization measurements. They have the potential to offer true randomness and high generation rates but can be expensive and complex to implement. Each of these types of generators has its use case, with PRNGs being sufficient for many everyday applications. However, when strong unpredictability and security are required, CSPRNGs or TRNGs are preferred. QRNGs are particularly advantageous in use cases that require high-performance computation with low discrepancy sequences, while Quantum RNGs are cutting-edge technologies with applications in quantum computing and high-security contexts. It's important to choose the right type of generator based on the specific needs of the application, whether it's for cryptographic security, simulation accuracy, or real-time performance."},{"prompt":"Low-Discrepancy Sequences","completion":"Low-discrepancy sequences, also known as quasi-random sequences or sub-random sequences, are sequences of numbers that are used to create more evenly distributed samples of points within a given space, as compared to the samples created by pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). Unlike truly random sequences that often cluster due to variance inherent in random processes, low-discrepancy sequences aim to fill the space more uniformly. This characteristic makes them particularly useful in numerical integration methods such as Quasi-Monte Carlo integration and in various applications such as financial modeling, computer graphics, and simulations. Key properties of low-discrepancy sequences include: 1. **Low Discrepancy**: This refers to the property where the sequence has a smaller deviation from the uniform distribution when compared to a random sequence. This results in a more uniform and evenly distributed set of points. 2. **Deterministic**: Unlike random numbers, the generation of low-discrepancy sequences is entirely deterministic. Given the same initial conditions, the sequence will always be the same. 3. **Faster Convergence**: In numerical methods like the Quasi-Monte Carlo method, low-discrepancy sequences can lead to faster convergence rates towards the integral's value than what would be achieved with random sampling. Examples of low-discrepancy sequences include: - **The van der Corput Sequence**: This is one of the simplest examples of a low-discrepancy sequence, generated by reversing the base-n representation of integers. - **The Halton Sequence**: An extension of the van der Corput sequence to multiple dimensions, where each dimension uses a different base for the van der Corput calculation. - **The Sobol Sequence**: A type of sequence that relies on the use of direction numbers and bitwise operations to generate points in multi-dimensional space. - **The Faure Sequence**: It uses permutations of sequences in base ( b ) in higher dimensions for better distribution properties. - **The Niederreiter Sequence**: Based on the concept of finite fields, it offers a highly uniform distribution in multidimensional space. These sequences are constructed based on mathematical principles that aim to minimize \\"discrepancy\\", which is a measure of how uniformly a sequence covers the domain. The use of low-discrepancy sequences in simulation and modeling can result in more accurate estimates with fewer samples than with randomly generated points. It is essential to notice that while low-discrepancy sequences tend to distribute points more uniformly, they do not behave like 'truly' random sequences with respect to other statistical properties. Consequently, they may not be appropriate for applications that rely on the specific statistical characteristics of random numbers, such as cryptographic applications where unpredictability is crucial."},{"prompt":"can you illustrate to me how pyro fuse works?","completion":"Sure! A pyro fuse, also known as a pyrotechnic fuse or a pyro switch, is a safety device that is used to quickly and reliably disconnect a high-current circuit, like the ones you'd find in electric and hybrid vehicles' battery packs, in the event of a collision or fault. The purpose of the pyro fuse is to prevent electrical arcing and potential fires by physically separating the electrical connections within the battery pack when excessive current or a significant impact is detected. Here's how a pyro fuse works: 1. **Detection**: The initial step involves the detection of a fault or collision. This can be done by the vehicle's sensors and safety systems, which are constantly monitoring for signs of an accident or electrical issues. 2. **Signal**: Once a collision or fault is detected, a signal is sent to the pyro fuse system. This can happen in milliseconds — the speed is critical to ensure the safety of the occupants and to prevent further damage to the electrical systems. 3. **Ignition**: The pyro fuse incorporates a small charge of pyrotechnic material. When the signal is received, this charge is electrically ignited, which is a highly controlled process that happens very rapidly. 4. **Cutting the Circuit**: The ignition of the pyrotechnic material generates a significant amount of gas and pressure in an extremely brief period. This pressure is used to drive a mechanism, which might be a piston or a blade, to quickly and physically sever an electrical conductor or busbar within the fuse. As a result, the circuit is instantaneously opened and the flow of current is stopped. 5. **Open Circuit**: After the pyro fuse has been activated, the circuit remains open. This means that even if the electrical system tries to re-engage or if there's residual energy that could potentially arc, the physical barrier created by the pyro fuse prevents the flow of electricity. 6. **Permanent Disconnection**: This action of the pyro fuse is usually a one-time, non-reversible action. After it has been triggered, the pyro fuse needs to be replaced before the electrical system can function again. This is because the physical connection within the fuse has been permanently severed, and there is no way to reset or reconnect it without completely replacing the component. The pyro fuse is a critical component in electric vehicle safety, ensuring that in the event of severe accidents, the likelihood of an electrical fire is greatly diminished by interrupting the high-energy electrical circuits within the vehicle battery system. Because it operates so quickly and reliably, it is a preferred method of circuit interruption in situations where safety is paramount."},{"prompt":"what is the pyrotechnic?","completion":"A pyrotechnic refers to any material or device designed to produce an effect by heat, light, sound, gas/pressure, or smoke as a result of non-detonative, self-sustaining exothermic chemical reactions. This term is most commonly associated with fireworks and other devices used for entertainment, military, or industrial purposes. Pyrotechnic compositions are typically a mixture of an oxidizer and a fuel, which, when ignited, undergo rapid combustion. The applications of pyrotechnics include: 1. **Fireworks**: Used in celebrations and displays; these are the most well-known form of pyrotechnics. Different chemical compounds are used to create various colors and effects. 2. **Flares**: These are used for signaling, illuminating, or defensive countermeasures in civilian and military contexts. They produce bright light and sometimes smoke. 3. **Explosive Bolts and Cutters**: Utilized in aerospace and industrial applications to separate components or structures on demand. 4. **Cartridge-Actuated Devices (CADs)**: These are used to deploy emergency systems such as aircraft ejection seats or to activate fire suppression systems. 5. **Safety and Rescue**: Pyrotechnics are used in life-saving equipment, such as in vehicle airbag initiators and emergency escape systems. 6. **Stage and Special Effects**: In movies, television, and theater, pyrotechnics can simulate explosions, gunfire, and other dramatic effects. 7. **Propellants**: These are used to propel projectiles or rockets. The key to pyrotechnics is the precise formulation and control of the pyrotechnic mixture. By carefully selecting and mixing different chemical compounds, pyrotechnic engineers can control the rate of the reaction, the volume of gas produced, the temperature, and other characteristics fundamental to the intended application. For safety devices, such as pyro fuses in electric vehicles, the pyrotechnic composition is often a fast-reacting mixture that creates a specific and controlled action (such as generating gas to drive a piston) when ignited, often within milliseconds. These pyrotechnics are designed to be very reliable and safe until they are intentionally ignited by an electrical signal or other triggering mechanism."},{"prompt":"Abstract: 文化很复杂，可以作为变量，可以作为隐喻，也能作为涌现现象。本文将以英国电信变革计划作为例子，讨论文化对一个企业有什么影响。 Keywords: Culture，variable，metaphor，Emergence Culture as a variable 文化是一个复杂的现象。 Tylor (1871， cited in Garry，2009) defined culture as the complex whole, which is also a human being consisting of knowledge, beliefs, arts, morals and other abilities and habits.文化被视为一个可以观察和测量的变量，可以对其进行量化和分析。Samaraweera et al. (2017) argued that culture does not change so easily, and if it does change, it can only be through awareness of the need to change in the process of change or management decision making.所以，文化如果被改变，也只能是管理层带动才能有所改变。 文化是由一系列的价值观、信念、行为规范和社会规则构成的，可以通过对这些变量的研究来了解和解释组织或社会中的行为和决策。公司八年前雇佣了25万员工，但明显处于财政困难时期。因为雇佣了太多员工，所以现金流困难是肯定会发生的。虽然公司裁员都是自愿的但是1992年还是离开了1000人。公司已经处于如此困难的情况下，管理层意识到必须采取一些措施来力挽狂澜。公司提出了”......for a better life”,事实证明这个措施是很有效的。文化是一个可以观察和测量的变量，可以对其进行量化和分析。Here, culture is considered as glue that holds the organisation together.(Samaraweera et al., 2017) 所以提出的这个口号正是将文化作为一个变量，试图改变整个公司的企业文化，提升员工的士气，通过企业文化让员工原本不良负面的文化转变为积极的正面的企业文化，最大程度的激发员工的热情，提高员工的职业素养。尽管如此，公司也需要采取其他的措施去维护公司的运转。所以BT组建了两万人的消费部门，覆盖了所有一线员工。新上任的部门总经理Stafford Taylor敏锐的认识到必须改革公司的企业文化，只有这样才能救公司于水火之中。他认为必须培养以客户为中心的，积极上进努力的员工团队。他还提出，BT不止需要最新的技术，同时也需要训练有素专业的有职业素养的员工。先进的技术和永远把客户放在第一位热情的员工才能使得客户满意。如果不做出改变可能公司会倒闭。管理层通过有意识的文化改变公司员工的积极性，获得了成功。文化是由一系列的价值观、信念、行为规范和社会规则构成的，可以通过对这些变量的研究来了解和解释组织或社会中的行为和决策。一个公司的企业文化需要正向的文化来引导员工发展自己，实现自身的价值，员工也必须认可公司的价值观和行为规范。只有员工和企业合拍的情况下才能爆发惊人的能量。管理层正是认识到文化是一个重要的变量，所以才会首先从这里下手整治企业文化，这是BT陷入危机的根本原因。认识到这一点，我们才能知道为什么管理层决定提出”......for a better life”这个口号和成立两万人的消费部门。 企业文化是一个企业的地基。泰勒改革了公司企业文化，使得这个正确的企业文化深入员工的人心。这个措施很快取得丰厚的回报，员工受到企业文化的洗礼后，已经具备了良好的沟通能力，并且重要的是员工还能快速对客户的需求做出反应。在没有改革之前,BT的员工应该是缺乏效率，不太懂如何与客户沟通或者说缺少与客户沟通的意愿的，还有更糟糕的是他们缺少主观能动性，他们不能自由发挥自己的能力，可能使得与客户沟通比较困难。还有一个可能是由于员工的权力并没有被下放，他们的无法或者不敢自己下判断。六七年前，公司还是很死板的，是一个以流程为导向的组织，行为手册贯穿公司的方方面面，甚至操作员应该使用什么精确短语都有规定。在这种死板不变的企业文化下，员工不可能有积极上进的想法，一切都是循规蹈矩，一成不变，这种工作效率无疑是很低的，虽然不太可能犯错误，但是同样的也扼杀了员工的积极，与客户沟通的意愿。这个不良负面的官僚主义和不正确的责任分配已经导致了严重的后果。泰勒认为，现在员工必须具有四种特质：本能知道如何为BT做出最大贡献，对客户要求负责，采取果断行动和为取悦客户而承担风险。 Culture as metaphor. 文化不仅仅是让人们生活、交流和相互影响的方式，而且也可以被用来比喻、解释或传达其他主题或概念According to Roger et al(1999) corporate culture is now as important as organizational structure, strategy and control.企业文化是如此重要。 在公司陷入危机时，泰勒首先对企业文化做出了改革，他提出了新的工作方式。这不仅明确了我们对员工的期望，而且还改变了他们工作的方式，与此同时员工们还被灌输了一种兴奋感和归属感。这就是文化作为隐喻的表现。Metaphor means comparing one thing to another, such as Homer comparing Achilles to a lion, meaning that both things have the same courage or strength .(Berger 2015). 泰勒改革了公司的企业文化，而这种新文化无形之中给员工灌输了一种神奇的魔力，激发了他们工作的热情，让上班的过程变得兴奋和热情。Popular view of strengthening/changing culture an extension of managerial control.泰勒选择的不是加强文化而是改变文化，因为原有的企业文化太过死板和程序化，只能大幅改变文化。在保留原有文化的精华的同时，去除程序化文化的糟粕。在这种文化影响下，员工们变得更自信更有创造力。事实证明，泰勒这一举措获得了很大成功。在今年的一月，消费者部门84%的员工表示他们与自己直属经理的关系感到满意或非常满意，三年前这个比例仅为61%。管理者当前的角色更多将是教练，帮助人们做出决策。BT的新工作方式以双管齐下的方式为基础，这是一个很聪明的做法。公司想向员工灌输新的企业文化，但不是这么简单就能做到的。所以BT的做法就是两种方式并行，首先公司让员工相信他们对自己所说的话是认真的，他们必须更灵活对待自己的工作，不再像以前这么死板，官僚主义，他们可以期望经理采取不同的行动。其次，BT的经理也被鼓励去改变员工的行为，毕竟不是所有的员工都愿意改变。在双管齐下的新方式，公司的企业文化迅速的改变为灵活积极的文化。The main metaphor leads to movement, and the main reason is the power of the crowd (Paul, 2007).所以改革文化后，公司也开办了不少活动去深化文化在员工心中的印象。 Culture as Emergence 文化作为一种新的、独特的现象出现，并通过交互作用和合作进一步发展，这就是文化涌现。文化是人创造出来的，也是人发展下去的。In 2018, Australia's Royal commission into irregularities in the financial industry found a number of systemic problems that should not have occurred. According to the committee, the reason lies in the company's system and culture.(Monica, 2023) B T原本死板的官僚主义文化也是经过长时间演变而来的，不去改革就会导致严重的后果。Culture is a unifying phenomenon that can also be created and used(Trauner, 2017).文化是人创造的，但是当公司遇到危机时，这个旧文化就不再适合当前的公司，所以由泰勒为代表的管理层提出了发展新文化，也就是提倡新工作方式，激发员工的热情和同理心，让员工对客户负起责任，承担为公司做贡献的责任。并且让经理和下属可以和谐相处，互相激励，激发员工的创新能力，让他们能够自主决定以前他们无权做的事情。在新文化的倡导下，管理层由以前的指挥，监督和控制转变为了鼓励，指导和帮助。在群体上，所有员工不论是经理还是普通员工，大家都建立了一套相同的价值观、信仰体系和行为规范。涌现的新文化影响着大家的观念，这是由于文化的动态性，开放性和创造性。个人上，员工更加的自信，开放，开始作为公司的主人翁为公司做出贡献，不再是以往循规蹈矩的机器人。新文化的涌现出乎大家的意料，员工慢慢意识到自己其实可以做决定，也应该承担责任了。员工对自己的生活有了更强的动力和掌控感，甚至在寻找更有想象力的方式提高自己的技能。文化的涌现还催生了各种运动，比如公司拍摄了六个有视频作品，并举行了奥斯卡风格的颁奖典礼；公司还开始了\\"Boots and wings\\"运动，该项目邀请员工为贫困地区的学生提供指导。员工们在不断涌现的新文化中收益，变得越来越热情，工作方式大大改变，员工不断创新，积极为公司做贡献。公司在涌现的文化也得到了发展，由原本的死气沉沉变得生机勃勃，全体上下焕然一新。 总结 在一个公司陷入危机时，首先就要去找根本原因。正常来说，企业文化可能会是根本原因，如果想要改革，就从这方面入手比较合适。文化是一个公司的根基，看起来虚无缥缈，但实际上比人们想象中的重要得多。当然光从文化上改革也是不够的，一个公司陷入危机不单只有一个原因，还有其他的原因需要解决。解决问题也不能只有管理层去努力，普通的员工同样也要努力为公司做贡献，积极为公司创造业绩才能让一个公司长远的发展下去。翻译为英文，再优化一下，降低重复率","completion":"Abstract: Culture is multifaceted and can function as a variable, metaphor, and an emergent phenomenon. This paper will discuss the impact of culture on an organization by examining the transformation program of British Telecom (BT). It will highlight the profound influence that culture has on various aspects of an enterprise. Keywords: Culture, Variable, Metaphor, Emergence Culture as a Variable: Culture encompasses a wide array of values, beliefs, behavioral norms, and social rules that form the foundation of an organization, influencing behavior and decision-making. E.B. Tylor (1871, as cited in Garry, 2009) conceptualized culture as a complex whole which includes knowledge, beliefs, arts, morals, and other capabilities and habits. As a variable, culture can be quantified and analyzed, and though resistant to change, it can be transformed through conscious managerial efforts. British Telecom, despite having approximately 250,000 employees, faced financial difficulties potentially attributable to overstaffing, which triggered cash flow issues. Realizing the need for cultural transformation, the management put forth measures, including a slogan \\"......for a better life,\\" effectively uplifting the morale. This initiative regarded culture as a factor that could unify and transform the company, fostering a positive and vibrant work environment. A new 20,000-member consumer division, led by Stafford Taylor, was established to spearhead customer-centric cultural reforms, emphasizing customer satisfaction and the importance of well-trained, ethically sound employees. Culture as Metaphor: The cultural shift at BT served as a metaphor for rejuvenation and alignment with core values. Taylor's reforms instilled a sense of excitement and belonging among employees, changing not just what they did, but how they performed their tasks. This metaphorical transformation paralleled comparisons in literature, such as Roger et al.'s (1999) assertion that corporate culture is as crucial as organizational structure. Under the influence of the renewed culture, employees developed increased confidence and creativity, which translated to positive outcomes. For example, satisfaction between staff and line managers rose notably as the managerial role evolved to coach and facilitate decision-making rather than command and control. Culture as Emergence: Cultural emergence is viewed as an evolution of interconnected and cooperative elements within an organization. The previously bureaucratic culture of BT was reimagined to empower employees to take responsibility for client satisfaction and contribute meaningfully to the company's success. This emergent culture was marked by a dynamic, open, and creative milieu, enabling employees to exercise autonomy in decision-making. The transformation led to collective alignment, where both management and staff shared common values and standards. Numerous initiatives, like video production for internal awards and the \\"Boots and Wings\\" mentoring program, reinforced the flourishing culture, leading to invigorated employee engagement and organizational vibrancy. Conclusion: When a company faces a crisis, it's crucial to identify the root causes, which often reside within the corporate culture. Thus, initiating cultural reforms can be an appropriate starting point. While culture may seem intangible, it underpins the foundation of a company more significantly than might be expected. However, cultural transformation alone is not sufficient. A combination of strategies addressing various issues is needed, requiring the collective effort of both management and employees to ensure sustainable development."},{"prompt":"1.Al-Bannay, Hana, et al. \\"Culture as a Variable in Health Research: Perspectives and Caveats.\\" Health Promotion International, vol. 29, no. 3, 2014, pp. 549-57.

How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information on a certain topic, feel free to ask."},{"prompt":"Please, write any instruction","completion":"Certainly! Instructions can vary widely in content and format depending on the task at hand. Below are sample instructions for a basic task: making a cup of tea. **How to Make a Cup of Tea** **What You Need:** - Tea bag or loose-leaf tea - Kettle or pot for boiling water - Mug or teacup - Measuring spoon (if using loose-leaf tea) - Tea infuser or strainer (if using loose-leaf tea) - Water - Optional: milk, sugar, lemon, or honey **Instructions:** 1. **Fill the Kettle:** Fill your kettle with fresh, cold water. The amount you need depends on how many cups of tea you're making, but be sure to fill the kettle enough so that the water covers the heating element if you're using an electric kettle. 2. **Boil the Water:** Place the kettle on the stove or press the button to start the electric kettle. Boil the water to the appropriate temperature. For black tea or herbal tea, the water should be rolling boiling (around 212°F or 100°C). For green or white tea, aim for slightly cooler water (around 175°F or 80°C). 3. **Prep Your Cup:** While the water is heating, prepare your mug or teacup. If using a tea bag, place it in the cup. If using loose-leaf tea, measure the appropriate amount (typically about 1 teaspoon per cup) into a tea infuser or directly into the cup if you plan to strain it later. 4. **Pour the Water:** Once the water reaches the proper temperature, pour it over the tea bag or leaves. Be sure to saturate them completely for the best flavor extraction. 5. **Steeping Time:** Let the tea steep for the correct amount of time. This typically ranges from 3-5 minutes for black tea and 2-3 minutes for green tea. Herbal teas may take longer, around 5-10 minutes. Check your tea's packaging for precise recommendations. 6. **Remove the Tea Bag or Leaves:** If you've used a tea bag, remove it from the cup and set it aside. For loose-leaf tea, remove the infuser or pour the tea through a strainer to catch the leaves. 7. **Add-Ins (Optional):** If you like, now is the time to add milk, sugar, lemon, or honey to taste. Stir gently to combine if you've added anything. 8. **Enjoy Your Tea:** Carefully take a sip to make sure it's not too hot. Once it's at a comfortable drinking temperature, enjoy your perfectly brewed cup of tea! Remember, these steps are a guide and can be adjusted to suit your personal taste preferences or the specific type of tea you are preparing. Enjoy your tea time!"},{"prompt":"Hello","completion":"Hello!

Then will this stop my pyrogram fetching chunks via stream_media too? I want it to stop unnesscary fetching. If user has broken the connection, then stop fetching it.... If it's already like that, then I guess no need for any code changes...","completion":"In the asynchronous \`stream_video\` function you provided, the Pyrogram client is used to stream a video in chunks using the \`stream_media\` method. When streaming over HTTP with aiohttp, the server does not inherently know if the client has abruptly disconnected unless it tries to write to the client, and an exception occurs because the client is no longer there to receive the data. Your current implementation writes data to the response inside the loop that streams chunks of the video: \`\`\`python await response.write(chunk) \`\`\` If the client disconnects in the middle of this process, the next call to \`response.write\` or \`response.write_eof\` will raise an exception (most likely \`ConnectionResetError\` or \`aiohttp.ClientConnectionError\`), because the client is no longer connected to receive the data. This should effectively stop the server from continuing to fetch and send chunks because it would exit the loop that streams the video, ending the response and the coroutine. To ensure the behavior you desire—to stop streaming when the client disconnects—you need to include a try-except block around the \`response.write\` call and handle exceptions that indicate a client disconnection by breaking the loop. Here's an updated chunk of your \`stream_video\` method: \`\`\`python ... # Stream the media from Pyrogram try: async for chunk in client.stream_media(message, limit=limit, offset=offset): # Check if chunk needs to be trimmed chunk_start = offset * chunk_size chunk_end = chunk_start + len(chunk) - 1 # Trim front if chunk_start < start: chunk = chunk[start - chunk_start:] # Trim end if end and chunk_end > end: chunk = chunk[:end - chunk_start + 1] # Write chunk to response try: await response.write(chunk) except (ConnectionResetError, aiohttp.ClientConnectionError): # Client disconnected, so stop sending data break offset += 1 # Move to the next chunk if chunk_end >= end: break await response.write_eof() except aiohttp.ClientConnectionError: # If the client had disconnected before the loop started, it will raise # the exception here and we can handle it accordingly. pass ... \`\`\` The \`except\` blocks added here are designed to catch client disconnections. If the connection is closed, the exception will be raised and you can handle it, stopping any unnecessary data streaming. Adjust the specific exception handling as needed based on the errors you might encounter in your environment or web server logs."},{"prompt":"Great. You were on point. Plus, can we make it have a queue system? kinda like that? I mean, it's not exactly like that. what I'm saying is that, It should always serve latest request and stop current one if new request comes in. Make it such that it always serves new request and stop current one. Why doing such? It's because, it's a personal tool and will be used by single person.","completion":"To achieve the behavior where your server prioritizes the latest request and cancels any ongoing streaming of a video when a new request comes in, you will need to manage the currently streaming task and replace it with a new one when a new request arrives. You can use an \`asyncio.Task\` to keep track of the current streaming coroutine and cancel it when necessary. Here’s a revised version of your code that implements this simplified queue system. This code is not production-quality but rather a conceptual demonstration that should be further refined to fit your specific use case and to handle potential edge cases: \`\`\`python import asyncio from aiohttp import web from pyrogram import Client # Global variable to hold the current streaming task current_task = None ... async def stream_video(request): global current_task global client # Cancel the current task if there is one if current_task and not current_task.done(): current_task.cancel() # Wrap the current request handling in a coroutine async def handle_request(): try: client = await Client(\\"my_account\\").start() except Exception: pass # Your existing implementation # ... # Remember to add the try-except block around \`response.write(chunk)\` as discussed before # Now you are creating a new task and storing it in the global variable current_task = asyncio.create_task(handle_request()) try: # The calling coroutine will wait until the task is done or canceled await current_task except asyncio.CancelledError: pass # Ignore cancellation return web.Response(status=204) # No Content ... \`\`\` Please take note of the following: 1. When a new request arrives, and there's a current task (a current ongoing request/stream), the code first checks if the current task is still running and cancels it with \`current_task.cancel()\`. 2. You’ll need to handle the \`asyncio.CancelledError\` in the current task. If you’re streaming in a loop, make sure to periodically check if the task has been canceled and exit the loop if it has. 3. The coroutine \`handle_request\` handles the video streaming, and we create a new task with \`asyncio.create_task\` that runs this coroutine. We then await the completion of this task, which could be either because the video finished streaming or because the task was canceled by a new incoming request. 4. A \`204 No Content\` response is returned if the task ends prematurely due to cancellation. Adjust this behavior based on your specific needs. Keep in mind that cancelling tasks is a low-level operation that can be tricky. You need to make sure that all your coroutines are designed to handle cancellation properly, and you'll want to ensure that no resources are left in an inconsistent state after a cancellation. This approach assumes that you will have a low volume of requests and that the overhead of setting up a new \`Client\` instance for each request is acceptable (since you mentioned it's a personal tool). In a more sophisticated implementation, you might want to reuse the \`Client\`, for instance by keeping it running in the background, and simply controlling the media streaming based on the latest request."},{"prompt":"Is this what you expected me to do?

It correctly cancels any ongoing \`current_task\` when a new request comes in and starts handling the new request. However, there is still a critical issue in the code that must be addressed for proper operation. The problem is with the multiple assignments to \`client\`. You are reassigning a new \`Client\` instance to \`client\` for every incoming request in the \`handle_request()\` function. This is not necessary if you only want one global \`Client\` instance—a single \`Client\` instance can serve multiple requests. To handle this more efficiently, consider starting the \`Client\` outside of the request handler and reusing that instance. Below, I have adjusted your code to instantiate the \`Client\` outside of the \`handle_request()\` coroutine, ensuring that the same \`Client\` instance is reused: \`\`\`python import asyncio from aiohttp import web from pyrogram import Client # Global variable to hold the current streaming task and the Pyrogram client current_task = None client = None async def start_client(): global client try: client = Client(\\"my_account\\") await client.start() except Exception as e: print(f\\"Failed to create Pyrogram client: {e}\\") async def stream_video(request): global current_task global client if current_task and not current_task.done(): current_task.cancel() # ... (Rest of your existing handle_request function) # ... async def main(): # Start the Pyrogram client before running the app await start_client() # Rest of your server startup code, like routing and web.run_app loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(main()) # Rest of your server startup code, like routing and web.run_app \`\`\` Now, \`start_client()\` is a coroutine responsible for instantiating the \`Client\` and starting the Pyrogram session. This should be executed once when your server application starts up, before handling any requests. The rest of the code within \`stream_video()\` should remain the same. Make sure you don't have multiple Pyrogram \`Client\` objects being created for each request, and handle any exceptions that might get raised during the streaming process to ensure smooth operation. Additionally, although your current implementation should fulfill the concept of prioritizing new requests, in more complex systems, you might want to add logic for handling concurrent requests more gracefully, possibly by implementing a request queuing system that appropriately manages multiple user sessions or ensuring that resources are not wasted if a large volume of requests comes in."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

When a vehicle’s control unit detects an issue through its monitoring systems, it generates a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC), which is an alphanumeric identifier for the fault. DTCs are used to help technicians diagnose and resolve issues within the vehicle. In UDS and the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) system, there are different statuses that a DTC can have: 1. **Confirmed DTC**: This indicates that a malfunction has been detected and confirmed. The conditions necessary to set the DTC have occurred at least once, and the DTC is stored in non-volatile memory. A confirmed DTC often causes the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) or check engine light to illuminate on the dashboard. 2. **Pending DTC**: When a fault is initially detected, but the monitoring criteria have not been met to confirm it as a consistent problem, it is stored as a pending DTC. The issue may or may not result in the MIL illuminating, depending on the vehicle's criteria for MIL activation. 3. **Stored DTC**: This is a DTC stored in the memory that can be retrieved during diagnostics. It can be either confirmed or pending, and sometimes even cleared DTCs are stored for a certain number of drive cycles for historical diagnostic purposes. 4. **Permanent DTC**: Certain DTCs are stored permanently until specific conditions are met which allow the ECU to clear the DTC. These cannot be cleared by a simple diagnostic scanner reset and typically require a set number of drive cycles without the fault reoccurring or specific repair actions to be performed. The \\"status byte\\" or \\"status of DTC\\" in UDS communication defines the status of the diagnostic trouble code in terms of its existence, confirmation, and the emission-related status. The UDS standard specifies several \\"status bits\\" for DTCs, which may include: - Test failed: Indicates if the test failed during the last completed driving cycle. - Test failed this operation cycle: Indicates if the test failed during the currently running driving cycle. - Pending DTC: Indicates that the fault is not yet confirmed. - Confirmed DTC: Indicates that the fault is confirmed, as described above. - Test not completed since last clear: Indicates if the test has been completed since the last time the DTCs were cleared. - Test failed since last clear: Indicates if the test failed since the last time the DTCs were cleared. - Test not completed this operation cycle: Indicates that the test has not been completed in the current driving cycle. The confirmedDTC value, if present in the response from an ECU, represents a DTC that has been validated as a confirmed fault. For detailed interpretation, it’s important to refer to the specific vehicle manufacturer's documentation and the UDS standard (ISO 14229) as the implementation may vary."},{"prompt":"what defines if the dtc is confirmed or pending?","completion":"The definition of whether a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is considered \\"confirmed\\" or \\"pending\\" largely depends on the diagnostic strategies employed by a vehicle's Engine Control Unit (ECU) or other control modules and the parameters set by the manufacturer. However, there are some general principles that are commonly followed: 1. **Pending DTC**: A pending DTC is typically set when a fault is detected by the ECU for the first time. The ECU may need to see the fault during two or more driving cycles before it decides the problem is not intermittent and confirms the DTC. This concept allows for temporary glitches to occur without immediately triggering a fault indicator, such as the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL), also known as the Check Engine Light. 2. **Confirmed DTC**: A DTC is confirmed when the fault conditions have been met consistently across multiple driving cycles (the exact number varies by manufacturer and can be as few as two). Once a DTC is confirmed, it usually results in an MIL being illuminated on the dashboard, and the code is stored in non-volatile memory in the ECU. The specific criteria underlying a DTC's transition from pending to confirmed can include, but are not limited to: - The frequency of the fault occurrence: The ECU may require the fault to occur a certain number of times before confirmation. - The duration of the fault: The ECU may need to detect the fault for a specific minimum duration. - Driving conditions: The vehicle may need to be operating under certain conditions (like engine temperature, speed, load, etc.) for the fault to be confirmed. - Number of drive cycles: The vehicle typically needs to complete full drive cycles, where conditions for detecting the fault are met. A \\"drive cycle\\" is a sequence of vehicle operation states that typically includes starting the engine, driving, and turning off the engine. When the vehicle is restarted later, a new cycle begins. The definition of a drive cycle can vary among manufacturers but generally includes a cold start followed by a mix of highway and city driving patterns. The On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) standards provide a general framework for DTC management, but manufacturers have the latitude to define the specifics. The reason for this two-step (pending to confirmed) diagnostic approach is to prevent false alarms and unnecessary MIL triggers for conditions that do not indicate a true fault. To read and understand the specific criteria for confirming DTCs for a particular vehicle or model, one should refer to the service manual or diagnostic procedures outlined by the manufacturer. Additionally, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) provides diagnostic trouble code definitions and conditions within the J2012 standard, which might help understand common criteria applied in DTC confirmation."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

If another player kills you and they have an empty hot bar slot, they gain one from you. If you lose all your hot bar slots, there’s a consequence such as a entering spectator mode. Please give me full detailed steps including the code for all files. Make sure you learn it from all documentary","completion":"Creating a behavior pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition with the specific mechanics you've described involves several steps and requires a good understanding of the Bedrock Edition's add-on system, which includes JSON and potentially some scripting using Minecraft's GameTest framework. Below is a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take to implement this idea. Due to the complex nature of this feature, I'll guide you through conceptually, but writing the complete code would be too lengthy and beyond the scope of this platform. # Step 1: Set Up the Behavior Pack 1. Create a new folder for your behavior pack, such as \`BehaviorPackName\`. 2. Inside this folder, create the following directory and files: - \`manifest.json\` - \`pack_icon.png\` - \`functions/\` (to store your .mcfunction files) - \`scripts/\` (if you intend to use scripting) The \`manifest.json\` file contains metadata about your behavior pack. Define your pack by filling in all necessary fields. You can follow the documentation or use the Minecraft sample packs as a reference to construct your \`manifest.json\`. # Step 2: Create Player Death Detection There is no direct way to detect player deaths with only JSON in Bedrock Edition. However, a workaround could involve using scoreboards to indirectly detect death or using GameTest framework's scripting API (still in Beta as of the knowledge cutoff date) which has better event handling. For the scoreboard method: 1. Create a scoreboard objective to track player deaths. 2. Execute commands upon death to adjust hotbar slots. # Step 3: Implement Hotbar Slot Alteration (Conceptual) Managing hotbar slots isn't directly supported in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. However, you could simulate the effect by enforcing rules on players, such as preventing the use of certain slots upon dying by using \`replaceitem\` to fill slots with barrier blocks or other unusable items. # Step 4: Transfer Hotbar Slots Between Players Transferring hotbar slots from one player to another is quite challenging as there is no direct mechanic for this. You would likely need to detect a PvP kill, then use \`replaceitem\` to add or remove items from a player's hotbar. # Step 5: Implement Spectator Mode as Consequence Spectator mode is not officially available in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. As an alternative, you could place the player in Adventure mode, apply invisibility, and prevent them from interacting with the world using commands. # Step 6: Use Scripting for More Control (Optional) Minecraft's GameTest framework allows you to write scripts in JavaScript, which provides more control over the game's logic. However, it's important to check the documentation for the latest updates since the scripting API is subject to change. # Step 7: Testing and Tweaking You will need to continuously test your behavior pack in-game to ensure that the mechanics work as intended. Be prepared for a lot of iteration, since Minecraft's behavior packs can be tricky to get right, especially with complex mechanics. Since writing the entire code for such a pack would be very extensive and is subject to the Minecraft Bedrock Edition's current capabilities as well as updates, this overview is intended to get you started. It's recommended that you delve into the official Minecraft documentation, community forums, and tutorials, as many of the features you want to implement require advanced knowledge and may only be possible through creative workarounds or the use of experimental features."},{"prompt":"I liked the idea u gave in 3. Can you please use that and make a addon for me. Please try.","completion":"Creating a full-fledged behavior pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition would be beyond the scope of what can be provided here due to the complexity of the task and the length of code required. However, I can guide you through the process and give you a starting point on how you might simulate the loss of hotbar slots using barrier blocks. Let's lay out a rough plan for how this could be set up within the behavior pack: 1. **Create Scoreboard to Track Deaths:** First, you'll need a scoreboard objective to track player deaths. \`\`\`mcfunction scoreboard objectives add playerDeaths deathCount \`\`\` 2. **Create Functions:** You'll want to create functions to handle the modification of hotbar slots upon death. This might involve granting and removing artificial \\"slots\\" which are just placeholder items in the hotbar. 3. **Use Commands to Simulate Hotbar Slot Loss:** After a player dies, you'll run a command to fill one of their hotbar slots with a barrier block, which effectively makes it unusable. \`\`\`mcfunction replaceitem entity @p slot.hotbar 0 barrier 1 \`\`\` Remember to replace \`@p\` with the target selector that identifies the recently deceased player. 4. **Handle PvP Kill Detection and Slot Transfer:** This is trickier, as there is no direct way to handle a PvP kill event in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. You would need to have logic that checks if a player killed another player and then execute the appropriate commands. 5. **Implement the Spectator Mode Alternative:** For a player who has lost all hotbar slots, you can put them in Adventure mode and apply effects like invisibility to simulate a spectator-like experience. \`\`\`mcfunction gamemode adventure @p[name=SomePlayerName,tag=NoSlotsLeft] effect @p[name=SomePlayerName,tag=NoSlotsLeft] invisibility 1000000 255 true \`\`\` 6. **Assemble the Behavior Pack:** You'll need to structure your behavior pack with the \`manifest.json\`, folder structure, functions, and possibly scripts. For example: \`\`\` <BehaviorPackName>/ ├── functions/ │ ├── apply_death_penalty.mcfunction │ └── check_for_pvp_kills.mcfunction ├── manifest.json ├── pack_icon.png └── ... \`\`\` 7. **Test and Debug:** Testing your pack is vital. See what works and what doesn't, and iterate on your design. Please note that this outline is highly simplified. In reality, you would need to consider edge cases, multiplayer interactions, efficiency, and performance. If you're not experienced with creating Minecraft behavior packs, mods, or scripts, this will be a significant project, and you'd need to spend time learning and experimenting. I encourage you to visit the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Behavior_Pack) and other community resources like the [Minecraft Forums](https://www.minecraftforum.net/) or [r/MCPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/), where you can find detailed guides and ask for help from the community members who have experience in this area. Creating mods for Minecraft can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it is also a skill that requires you to be comfortable with coding, debugging, and thinking through game design. Good luck with your behavior pack!"},{"prompt":"If it's toomuch for you then let's do it in steps. First do the 1 step completely. give code.","completion":"Certainly. Let's start with step one, which involves creating a scoreboard to track player deaths. In Minecraft Bedrock Edition behavior packs, you actualize features mainly through the use of a combination of JSON files and Minecraft commands. For the step we're focusing on, we're using commands only. Here's how you can do it: 1. Open Minecraft and create a world or use an existing world where you have operator permissions. 2. Once you're in the game, you need to open the chat to enter commands. 3. Type the following command to create a new scoreboard objective that tracks player deaths: \`\`\` /scoreboard objectives add playerDeaths deathCount \`\`\` This command sets up an objective called \\"playerDeaths\\" which tracks the number of times players have died (the \`deathCount\` criteria). Now that you have an objective to track deaths, the next step would be to set up commands or functions that respond to changes in a player's death count. As for maintaining a behavior pack, the actual commands often go into a \`.mcfunction\` file, which contains a list of commands to run sequentially. Functions help you organize and trigger multiple commands at once. The command above is what you'd run directly in-game to quickly establish the necessary scoreboard objective for development and testing. In a packaged behavior pack, however, this would be placed within an initialization function. To proceed with the next steps in packaging this into a behavior pack, you'd continue by creating the appropriate folder structure and files (such as the \`manifest.json\` and the function files). If you were to create a function to initialize this, it could look like this: In a file \`initialize.mcfunction\` in your pack's \`functions/\` folder: \`\`\` scoreboard objectives add playerDeaths deathCount \`\`\` This function file should be run once to set up your scoreboard when the world loads or when you're ready to start tracking deaths. I advise that you take some time to review the official documentation, tutorials, or reference guides to get a comprehensive understanding of how to set up and use behavior packs in Minecraft Bedrock Edition."},{"prompt":"can't be done in behavior pack?","completion":"Apologies for the confusion earlier. Scoreboards can indeed be used within behavior packs in Minecraft Bedrock Edition; however, you need to initialize them manually since behavior packs don't have an automatic way to run commands when they are loaded. So, to set up a behavior pack that includes an initialization function for a scoreboard, you would do the following: 1. **Create Behavior Pack Structure:** Create a folder with the following structure: \`\`\` MyBehaviorPack/ ├── behavior_pack/ │ ├── functions/ │ │ └── initialize.mcfunction │ ├── manifest.json │ └── pack_icon.png \`\`\` 2. **Write Manifest File:** In the manifest file (\`manifest.json\`), you would include the metadata for your behavior pack: \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": 2, \\"header\\": { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Behavior Pack\\", \\"name\\": \\"Behavior Pack Template\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"behavior-pack-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0], \\"min_engine_version\\": [1, 16, 0] }, \\"modules\\": [ { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Behavior Pack\\", \\"type\\": \\"data\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"module-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] } ] } \`\`\` Replace \`behavior-pack-uuid-here\` and \`module-uuid-here\` with unique UUIDs generated for your project. 3. **Create the Initialization File:** In the \`initialize.mcfunction\` file located in the \`functions\` folder, you would write: \`\`\` scoreboard objectives add playerDeaths deathCount \`\`\` 4. **Link Function to Load Event (Optional):** Since behavior packs don't automatically execute functions, you would typically need to run your \`initialize.mcfunction\` manually by using the \`/function\` command in-game: \`\`\` /function initialize \`\`\` If you want to run a function automatically when the game starts or something happens (like when a player joins the world), you would currently need to use a Minecraft addon tool that supports the binding of functions to events, which Minecraft Bedrock typically doesn't support directly. Alternatively, you could instruct players to run the initialization command once when they begin using the pack. 5. **Packaging and Testing:** Once all files are created, the behavior pack can be compressed into a \`.zip\` file and renamed to \`.mcpack\` extension. Users can then double-click this file to import it into Minecraft. However, this won't load the function automatically. Be aware that specific features and formats might change as the Bedrock Edition is updated, so always check the latest documentation for the most accurate information. As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, automatic function execution on pack load or world load is not a feature of behavior packs without external tools or custom scripts. To reiterate, you'll need to manually run the \`/function initialize\` command when you first load your world, or when you want to ensure the scoreboard is set up for tracking deaths for your behavior pack to work correctly."},{"prompt":"Ok so, the 1 step is completed. Now please do the second step which is \\"2. Create Functions:\\". give full code.","completion":"To move on to the second step, you'll create functions to handle the hypothetical modification of hotbar slots upon death. Remember that this is a simplification, as Minecraft Bedrock Edition doesn't allow direct manipulation of a player's inventory slots with complete precision. Let's create a function to simulate the loss of a hotbar slot by placing a barrier block in the last non-barrier slot of the player's hotbar each time they respawn after dying. To do this, we will create a chain of functions in the behavior pack that will work with the scoreboard objective created earlier. 1. **Create the Function Files:** Create a new directory called \`functions\` within your behavior pack directory if you haven't already done so. Here's the updated structure: \`\`\` MyBehaviorPack/ ├── behavior_pack/ │ ├── functions/ │ │ ├── initialize.mcfunction │ │ ├── on_player_death.mcfunction │ │ └── on_player_respawn.mcfunction │ ├── manifest.json │ └── pack_icon.png \`\`\` The \`on_player_death.mcfunction\` and \`on_player_respawn.mcfunction\` are new files for handling death and respawn logic. 2. **Write the Death Function:** Inside \`on_player_death.mcfunction\`, write a command to increment a death counter. This is a placeholder because actual player kill detection can be tricky and we can't modify other player's hotbar directly with functions: \`\`\`mcfunction # Placeholder command, doesn't truly detect player kills or alter another player's inventory scoreboard players add @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] playerDeaths 1 \`\`\` 3. **Write the Respawn Function:** Inside \`on_player_respawn.mcfunction\`, write commands to replace hotbar slots with barrier blocks. This will check for the barrier block presence from slot 0 to 8 and place it in the first empty slot: \`\`\`mcfunction # This function must be run manually after a player has died, as automatic detection is not supported # Replace '0' with the next increment each time a player respawns after dying replaceitem entity @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] slot.hotbar 0 barrier \`\`\` 3. **Calling Functions and Testing:** As Bedrock behavior packs do not support automated event handling, you will need to manually trigger the functions. For testing purposes, after configuring the behavior pack and activating it in a world: - Have a player die in the game (to test, use \`/kill\` command). - After death, to simulate the \\"respawn\\" mechanism manually, use \`/function on_player_respawn\`. - This command would need to be run by an operator after the player has died and respawned. It simulates what you want to do, but without automation, it only serves as a proof of concept. 4. **Adding the Function to the Behavior Pack:** Once the commands are inside the respective function files, you'll need to compress the behavior pack into a \`.zip\` file, label it properly, and install it in your game to test manually. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of Minecraft Bedrock as of the knowledge cutoff in March 2023, there's no straightforward method for detecting a player's respawn event directly within a behavior pack. Running the \`/function on_player_respawn\` manually after respawning would demonstrate the concept. For the feature you're looking for—losing a hotbar slot on death—part of this functionality would still need to be managed by a server operator or through an accompanying resource pack that uses the scripting API, if available. Remember, this is a simplified explanation and intended to demonstrate concepts rather than a ready-to-use solution. Full automation of these functions requires the use of external tools or that players abide by an honor system to run the required commands manually."},{"prompt":"for 3, It's important that the function should run automattically after the death. or else it will ahev no point. Please do something.","completion":"In Minecraft Bedrock Edition, we currently cannot directly execute functions automatically after specific events, such as a player's death, without using a client-side scripting API, which is limited and experimental. However, we can use a workaround that continuously checks for player deaths and applies the effects as soon as the game detects that a player has died. This method involves using a ticking function. A ticking function is a function that runs every tick (20 times per second) to constantly check for certain conditions. Here's how you can create a ticking function: 1. **Create \`tick.json\`:** Firstly, within your behavior pack, create a directory called \`functions\` if it doesn't already exist. Within this directory, create or edit the file called \`tick.json\`. The directory structure should look like this: \`\`\` MyBehaviorPack/ ├── behavior_pack/ │ ├── functions/ │ │ ├── initialize.mcfunction │ │ ├── on_player_death.mcfunction │ │ └── tick.json │ ├── manifest.json │ └── pack_icon.png \`\`\` 2. **Define the Ticking Function:** Within the \`tick.json\` file, specify the function that should be run every tick: \`\`\`json { \\"values\\": [ \\"functions:on_player_death\\" ] } \`\`\` 3. **Create \`on_player_death.mcfunction\`:** In the \`on_player_death.mcfunction\` file, you will put your commands to check the player's death count and apply the barrier block to their hotbar. Because the function runs 20 times per second, any commands here need to be efficient to prevent lag. The \`on_player_death.mcfunction\` file should contain something like this (adjusted to your needs): \`\`\`mcfunction # Check if a player has died execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] ~ ~ ~ function my_pack:apply_death_penalty # Reset death count so that the function doesn't run again until they've died another time scoreboard players set @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] playerDeaths 0 \`\`\` 4. **Create \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\`:** This function will handle the logic to add a barrier to the player's hotbar, simulating the loss of a slot. Create the file \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\` in the \`functions\` directory with the commands to apply the penalty: \`\`\`mcfunction # Example command placing a barrier in the first hotbar slot replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 0 barrier 1 \`\`\` Updating this command to handle different slots based on the number of times a player has died would require a more complex setup of tracking additional scores that relate to the number of barrier blocks already placed. 5. **Load the Behavior Pack:** Don't forget to add the new function files to the \`manifest.json\` so that they're recognized by Minecraft. With this setup, whenever a player dies, their \`playerDeaths\` score will increase, and on the next tick (1/20th of a second later), the \`tick.json\` will execute \`on_player_death.mcfunction\`, which will call \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\` for that player specifically, then reset their death count. To finalize, update your behavior pack, repackage it, import it into Minecraft, and activate it for your world to test the functionality. This should give you a working system that automatically runs every tick and applies a penalty once it detects that a player has died. Please note that running a command every tick can impact performance, so make sure your commands are optimized and only target players that meet the conditions you are checking for."},{"prompt":"About this what u said \\"Don’t forget to add the new function files to the manifest.json so that they’re recognized by Minecraft.\\" how do i do it?","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. In Minecraft Bedrock Edition, function files are automatically recognized when placed in the appropriate folders within a behavior pack—there's no need to individually list them in the \`manifest.json\` file. That statement was incorrect in the context of Minecraft behavior packs. The \`manifest.json\` is used to define the metadata of the behavior pack, such as its name, description, UUID, version, and minimum engine version required. It doesn't include a list of the function files themselves. Here's an example of what your \`manifest.json\` should look like, containing only the metadata: \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": 2, \\"header\\": { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Behavior Pack\\", \\"name\\": \\"Behavior Pack Template\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"behavior-pack-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0], \\"min_engine_version\\": [1, 17, 0] }, \\"modules\\": [ { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Behavior Pack\\", \\"type\\": \\"data\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"module-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] } ] } \`\`\` Replace \`behavior-pack-uuid-here\` and \`module-uuid-here\` with UUIDs generated for your project.

Now do the 3 one \\"Use Commands to Simulate Hotbar Slot Loss:\\". give full code.","completion":"To simulate hotbar slot loss in Minecraft Bedrock Edition using commands in your behavior pack, we can't directly disable a hotbar slot. However, as we suggested earlier, we can use barrier blocks to fill up the hotbar slots. Since we cannot do this based on live events, we'll use a score on the scoreboard as a counter for how many times the player has died and thus how many slots should be filled. For each death, you can increment the respective player's death count and add another barrier block to their hotbar. Given the limitation of commands in Minecraft Bedrock, you'd typically check the death count and replace a slot accordingly for each tier of death count. Since it can be extensive to handle each hotbar slot uniquely, I'll demonstrate how to handle the first death scenario. You would then extend the logic to further slots. Let's improve what we have built upon in \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\`. This function will become more intelligent to handle which slot to replace based on the player's deaths: Inside \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\`, it may look something like this: \`\`\`mcfunction # Check how many times the player has died and 'use up' a slot for each death # Assuming the death count ranges from 1 to 9 since there are only 9 hotbar slots # If the player died once, fill the first slot with a barrier. execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=1}] ~ ~ ~ replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 0 barrier 1 # If the player died twice, fill the second slot with a barrier. (and so on...) execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=2}] ~ ~ ~ replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 1 barrier 1 # ... (Extend this pattern for each hotbar slot up to the 9th) # You need to reset the death count to avoid filling the hotbar with barriers on respawn tick. # Make sure to do this at the end after handling all the slots scoreboard players set @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] playerDeaths 0 \`\`\` You would have to add more lines in the \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\` file for each possible death count up to the number of hotbar slots you have. Here's an example of handling death count 1 and 2; you should extend this code to all 9 possible deaths (9 hotbar slots): \`\`\`mcfunction # For the first death, replace the 0th hotbar slot execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=1}] ~ ~ ~ replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 0 barrier 1 # For the second death, replace the 1st hotbar slot execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=2}] ~ ~ ~ replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 1 barrier 1 # Reset death count after applying penalty scoreboard players set @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] playerDeaths 0 \`\`\` Please note that this function must handle every possible value of playerDeaths up to the number of hotbar slots, so you should write similar lines of code for \`playerDeaths=3\`, \`playerDeaths=4\`, and so on, up to \`playerDeaths=9\`. Once you reach the maximum number of hotbar slots filled, you would then proceed to whatever penalty you want—for example, sending them into a spectator-like mode by using Adventure mode with invisibility and other effects applied. Remember to thoroughly test this behavior pack in-game to ensure everything works as intended. Due to the constraints of Minecraft Bedrock Edition, you won't be able to get the behavior to work perfectly, and players might be able to remove the barrier blocks. However, this method serves as a basic simulation given the limitations of Minecraft commands and current behavior pack features."},{"prompt":"can't this be done automatically?","completion":"In Minecraft Bedrock Edition, automating command execution based on in-game events like a player's death is quite limited without access to external tools or mods outside of what the base game provides. However, given the previous setup with the ticking function file (\`tick.json\`), we can simulate an automatic response to a player's death. The recent versions of Minecraft Bedrock Edition have introduced an entity component called \`minecraft:tick_world\` which can be used to run commands at every game tick scoped within a specified area. We could apply this to a dummy entity, but keep in mind that this is a very unusual way to try to achieve something that normally requires the experimental GameTest Framework scripting API. Inside the \`on_player_death.mcfunction\` file, we can regularly check each player's \`playerDeaths\` score and apply changes automatically. Updating this to be a repeating conditional check gives you the automatic application you desire. Continuing with the example provided in the \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\`: \`\`\`mcfunction # Apply death penalty based on playerDeaths score execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=1}] ~ ~ ~ replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 0 barrier 1 execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=2}] ~ ~ ~ replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 1 barrier 1 execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=3}] ~ ~ ~ replaceitem entity @s slot.hotbar 2 barrier 1 ... # Increment this pattern up to playerDeaths=9 for all hotbar slots. # Reset death count after applying penalty to avoid constant execution. scoreboard players set @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] playerDeaths 0 \`\`\` This file should now contain the command logic for what happens at each tier of \`playerDeaths\`, filling each hotbar slot with a barrier block. The \`tick.json\` file runs the \`on_player_death.mcfunction\` every tick, so as soon as a player's death score increments, these commands catch it on the very next tick, apply the appropriate hotbar penalty, and then reset the score. Remember that even with this approach, players can still manually remove barrier blocks from their hotbar, and you have to rely on an honor system or additional rules within your game to enforce the penalty. Moreover, these mechanisms introduce complexity and potential performance costs to your game. Running commands every tick needs to be done with caution, especially on multiplayer servers with many players. It is also essential to remind that as the Bedrock Edition evolves, more scripting capabilities may be added that can handle these types of game modifications more elegantly. Always check the latest documentation for the capabilities of Minecraft Bedrock Edition."},{"prompt":"Well done, 3 steps completed. now \\"4. Handle PvP Kill Detection and Slot Transfer:\\". make sure everything is syncing with existing and upcoming changes we did, if not then inform what to do.","completion":"Minecraft Bedrock Edition's command and behavior pack systems currently lack a direct method for PvP kill detection that would allow for an automated interaction such as transferring hotbar slots between players. PvP kill detection requires tracking which player has dealt damage to another player and then determining if that damage led to a death. However, we can conceptually plan an approach using command blocks or functions with scoreboard objectives that track player kills and adjust inventory slots as a substitute. We'll focus on behavior packs here. Please note that while we can detect player kills through scores, transferring inventory slots can only be simulated, as mentioned before. Assuming we can track player kills and deaths, the high-level plan would be as follows: # Step 4: Handle PvP Kill Detection and Slot Transfer 1. **Detect Player Kills:** Set up another scoreboard objective to track player kills. \`\`\`mcfunction scoreboard objectives add playerKills playerKillCount \`\`\` 2. **Check for Kills:** Whenever a player gets a kill, you could check if the killed player has lost all hotbar slots, and if the killing player has any slots to gain. \`\`\`mcfunction # Check if a player has made a kill and has space to gain a slot execute @a[scores={playerKills=1..}] ~ ~ ~ function my_pack:grant_slot \`\`\` 3. **Write \`grant_slot.mcfunction\`:** This function would be a way to simulate that a player has gained a slot back. You will need to devise a custom method to track which slots are available or used, as barrier blocks can be manually removed. Ideally, you would have a tagging system or similar to note which slots are 'officially' used or free. \`\`\`mcfunction # This is a conceptual example, as you can't directly give players slots tag @s add gainedSlot \`\`\` 4. **Write \`lose_slot.mcfunction\`:** Run a function for the player who was killed to lose a slot, which would increase their death count (since we're using death count to simulate lost slots). \`\`\`mcfunction # When a player dies, another function should handle the loss of slots execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] ~ ~ ~ function my_pack:lose_slot \`\`\` In this function, you'd simulate losing a slot similar to \`apply_death_penalty.mcfunction\`. 5. **Run Functions Upon Kills**: The functions \`grant_slot\` and \`lose_slot\` need to be called based on the periodic check upon the PvP events which would be within the ticking range. 6. **Possible Implementation Issues:** - Tracking a killed player's lost slots accurately requires a persistent tagging or scoring system that isn't directly built into the game. - Transferring a slot between players would not be an actual transfer but rather a simulation where a killing player could have a slot \\"unlocked\\" if they meet certain criteria. - Inventory management is inherently tricky in Minecraft Bedrock due to the limitations in command execution related to player inventories. # Upcoming Changes Consideration New features or updates introduced to Minecraft Bedrock can potentially change how behavior packs and commands function, making it easier or harder to implement certain features. Currently, without a custom scripting engine or an external server managing these complex interactions, the system discussed relies on manually enforced rules and concepts beyond Minecraft's native behavior pack capabilities. The limitations of Minecraft Bedrock mean that creating a fully automated, robust system for PvP slot transfer using only behavior packs and commands remains impractical, and the described concept is only a high-level outline that does not fully achieve the desired functionality. Certain custom operations, such as detecting who killed a player and altering another player's inventory, are not feasible with the current command system and may require an external plugin or mod on a dedicated server, which changes the discussion from behavior packs to a different modding system entirely. For now, developers and creators in the Minecraft community often use clever workarounds, and as new updates are released, it's always good to look out for new capabilities added to the behavior pack and command systems that could facilitate more advanced gameplay modifications."},{"prompt":"for check for kill step 2, on which file we have to write the code?","completion":"To check for PvP kills and handle the subsequent grant or loss of hotbar slots, you'd need to incorporate logic in both the \`tick.json\` file, which runs commands at every game tick, and the relevant function files which encapsulate the behavior when a kill is detected. To elaborate on step 2 for checking for player kills: 1. **Modify \`tick.json\`:** Ensure your \`tick.json\` file is set up to call a function that will check for player kills. It might look like this: \`\`\`json { \\"values\\": [ \\"my_pack:on_player_death\\", \\"my_pack:check_for_kills\\" ] } \`\`\` This instructs the game to run the \`on_player_death\` and \`check_for_kills\` functions every tick. 2. **Create \`check_for_kills.mcfunction\`:** You would then create a new function file within the \`functions\` directory of your behavior pack. Below is an example of what could be in the \`check_for_kills.mcfunction\` function file to check for player kills. \`\`\`mcfunction # checks if a player has kills and if they can receive a slot execute @a[scores={playerKills=1..}] ~ ~ ~ function my_pack:grant_slot # resets the playerKillCount score so that the function doesn't run again until they've killed another player scoreboard players set @a[scores={playerKills=1..}] playerKills 0 \`\`\` This file will run every tick due to \`tick.json\` and will execute the \`grant_slot\` function for any player that has recorded a player kill. Then it resets their \`playerKills\` score to prevent continuous execution. 3. **Link Player Deaths to Loss of Slots:** The existing \`on_player_death.mcfunction\` can handle the loss of slots when a player dies, so when a kill is detected, you'll want to ensure the slain player triggers that function as well. If a player has an \`playerDeaths\` score (because they were killed), you would similarly run the relevant function for them: \`\`\`mcfunction # Handle the loss of slots when a player dies execute @a[scores={playerDeaths=1..}] ~ ~ ~ function my_pack:apply_death_penalty \`\`\` With these components in place: - \`tick.json\` calls both \`check_for_kills\` and \`on_player_death\` every tick. - \`check_for_kills.mcfunction\` addresses the PvP kill detection and executes the appropriate functions. - \`on_player_death.mcfunction\` deals with penalizing players when they respawn after dying. Please remember that this system is more of a conceptual representation due to the limitations of Minecraft Bedrock Edition's command system. With these limitations in mind, it's important to note that this does not provide an official in-game mechanic for slot transfer. It's a simulation that will require additional context or rules provided to the players within your game's framework."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

RUTH (Holding back a yawn) You know, David, I read about this super cool relaxation thing you do with mind exercises. You wanna try? DAVID (Eyes still on TV) Eh? I dunno, Ruth. I'm alright with my high-quality reality show drama, thanks. RUTH (Cheeky) Come on, it feels amazing. Helps with stress and stuff. All the uni students are doing it.

Here are some tips that might help you initiate a conversation with him: 1. **Start Small**: If approaching him directly feels too daunting, try making small gestures first. Smile when you pass by him or offer a simple hello. These small interactions can make it easier to approach him later. 2. **Find Common Ground**: Look for shared interests or common experiences. Do you have classes together, mutual friends, or shared hobbies? These can be great conversation starters. 3. **Use Open Body Language**: Make sure your body language is open and inviting. Avoid crossing your arms or looking down at your phone when you're around him. 4. **Prepare Topics**: Think of a couple of topics to talk about in advance. This can include asking about a class or an event, talking about a recent school activity, or discussing a popular movie or TV show. 5. **Ask for Help or Advice**: People generally like to feel helpful. You could ask him for assistance with something, even if it's small, like borrowing a pen or getting his opinion on something. 6. **Bring a Friend**: If you're too nervous to go alone, bring a friend for moral support. Just make sure the friend knows to step back when the conversation gets going so you can talk to him one-on-one. 7. **Practice**: Rehearse what you might say in front of a mirror or with a trusted friend. This can boost your confidence and reduce anxiety. 8. **Accept Nervousness**: It's okay to be nervous. Sometimes, admitting you're a bit shy can even be endearing. If you feel brave enough, you could even tell him that you’ve been wanting to talk but have been too shy—it’s honest and relatable. 9. **Follow Up**: After your first conversation, make sure to follow up with him later. It could be as simple as acknowledging him with a smile the next time you see him or continuing the conversation if an opportunity comes up. Remember, the first step is the hardest, but once you make that move, it'll get easier over time. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"he likes five nights at freddys and i do too","completion":"That's great!

По-видимому, эти массивы содержат значения пикселей (или их масок) и коэффициентов для их преобразования, возможно, в значениях луминанса. Чтобы разложить эти две строки на функции, можно поступить следующим образом: \`\`\`wolfram CalculateLuminance[pixels_, coefficients_] := Mean[Dot[pixels, coefficients]] luminanceMasked = CalculateLuminance[maskedPixels, coefficients]; luminanceInverseMasked = CalculateLuminance[inverseMaskedPixels, coefficients]; \`\`\` В этом случае мы определяем функцию \`CalculateLuminance\`, которая принимает два аргумента: \`pixels\` (массив пикселей) и \`coefficients\` (массив коэффициентов).

Затем мы используем функцию \`CalculateLuminance\` для вычисления \`luminanceMasked\` и \`luminanceInverseMasked\`, передавая соответствующие массивы пикселей и коэффициентов. Обратите внимание, что перед использованием этого кода вы должны убедиться, что массивы \`maskedPixels\`, \`inverseMaskedPixels\`, и \`coefficients\` определены и содержат данные, которые вы хотите обработать."},{"prompt":"разложи на Mean и Dot","completion":"Из вашего запроса я понимаю, что вы хотите, чтобы определение средней величины (луминанса) было разложено с учётом отдельных операций. Прежде чем разделить каждую операцию, убедимся, что мы точно понимаем, что вы хотите сделать: Операция \`Dot[maskedPixels, coefficients]\` вычисляет скалярное произведение вектора \`maskedPixels\` и вектора \`coefficients\`. Далее, функция \`Mean[]\` вычисляет среднее значение элементов полученного списка. Для развертывания операций на функции \`Mean\` и \`Dot\` в Mathematica/Wolfram Language, можно создать две функции: одну для вычисления скалярного произведения, другую для вычисления среднего значения. Например: \`\`\`wolfram (* Функция для вычисления скалярного произведения между двумя списками *) CalculateDotProduct[array1_, array2_] := Dot[array1, array2] (* Функция для вычисления среднего значения списка *) CalculateMean[array_] := Mean[array] (* Вычисляем скалярное произведение для маскированных и обратных маскированных пикселей *) dotProductMasked = CalculateDotProduct[maskedPixels, coefficients]; dotProductInverseMasked = CalculateDotProduct[inverseMaskedPixels, coefficients]; (* Вычисляем среднее значение скалярных произведений *) luminanceMasked = CalculateMean[dotProductMasked]; luminanceInverseMasked = CalculateMean[dotProductInverseMasked]; \`\`\` Теперь обе операции разделены на отдельные функции. \`CalculateDotProduct\` возвращает скалярное произведение, а \`CalculateMean\` - среднее значение списка. Вызываем эти функции последовательно для двух разных наборов пикселей: \`maskedPixels\` и \`inverseMaskedPixels\`. Однако, важно заметить, что вызов функции \`Mean\` непосредственно после \`Dot\` в вашем начальном коде подразумевает, что \`maskedPixels\` и \`inverseMaskedPixels\` являются наборами векторов (или двумерными матрицами), где \`Dot\` вычисляется для каждой строки (или столбца) отдельно, а затем берется среднее всех результатов. В таком случае приведенный пример кода выше некорректен, поскольку функция \`CalculateDotProduct\` будет возвращать одно число, заместо списка, и функция \`CalculateMean\` просто вернет тоже число обратно, без вычисления среднего значения списка скалярных произведений. Если ваша задача действительно предполагает работу с двумерными матрицами, то первоначальный код уже проводит эти операции оптимально и никаких дополнительных функций для разложения на отдельные операции \`Mean\` и \`Dot\` не нужно."},{"prompt":"как убрать не убираемый пробел при копировании в Word","completion":"При работе с Microsoft Word иногда при копировании и вставке текста могут возникнуть неприятности со \\"специальными\\" пробелами.

Попробуйте выделить неразрывный пробел и просто удалить его клавишей Delete или Backspace. 3. Если вы хотите заменить неразрывный пробел на обычный, используйте функцию \\"Найти и заменить\\": - Нажмите Ctrl+H, чтобы открыть окно \\"Найти и заменить\\". - В поле \\"Найти\\" введите специальный код для неразрывного пробела (^s для неразрывного пробела или ^w для \\"широкого\\" пробела в зависимости от версии Word). - В поле \\"Заменить на\\" введите обычный пробел. - Нажмите \\"Заменить все\\". 4. Если пробел всё ещё не удаляется, возможно, у вас есть другой специальный символ или ошибка в файле. Попробуйте скопировать текст, исключая проблемный пробел, и вставить его в новый документ как \\"Текст без форматирования\\". 5. В крайнем случае можно открыть файл в текстовом редакторе, таком как Блокнот (Notepad), который не поддерживает форматирование. Это должно убрать все скрытые символы, включая неразрывные пробелы. Затем можно скопировать текст обратно в Word и снова применить необходимое форматирование. Убедитесь, что после удаления специальных пробелов документ всё ещё отображается правильно и текст не смещается непреднамеренным образом, особенно если это профессиональные или публикационные материалы."},{"prompt":"нарисуй в виде блок схемы Логика программы: Пока не найдется точка Мы создаем эллиптическую кривую с начальными параметрами Задаем количество точек для итераций Проверяем на обычность ЭК Проверяем на гладкость ЭК Если всё проходит, то идём по итерациям Берем случайную точку и находим ее порядок Если точка соответствует параметрам Выводим ее данные И заканчиваем Если не подходит берем следующую точку, пока <= 1000 В противном случае добавляем i, чтобы изменить ЭК и заново начать поиск","completion":"Создание блок-схемы для этой задачи в текстовом виде немного сложно, но я постараюсь описать основные шаги блок-схемы в соответствии с предоставленной вами логикой программы.

Она относится к семейству подписей с эллиптическими кривыми (ЭЦП) и базируется на трудности задачи вычисления дискретного логарифма. NR схема подписи использует следующие математические операции и утверждения: 1. Генерация ключей: - Выбирается эллиптическая кривая над конечным полем, и на этой кривой выбирается точка ( G ), которая будет служить генератором группы точек. - Выбирается приватный ключ ( x ), который является случайным числом из диапазона от 1 до порядка точки ( G ). - Вычисляется соответствующий публичный ключ ( Y ) как ( Y = x times G ), где ( times ) обозначает операцию умножения точки на скаляр в группе точек эллиптической кривой. 2. Создание подписи: - Задается сообщение ( m ), которое требуется подписать. - Выбирается случайное число ( k ) из диапазона от 1 до порядка точки ( G ). - Вычисляется точка ( k times G ), и ее координата ( x ) используется для вычисления компоненты подписи ( r ). - Используя ( r ), приватный ключ ( x ) и сообщение ( m ), вычисляется вторая компонента подписи ( s ). 3. Верификация подписи: - Для проверки подписи необходимы сообщение ( m ), подпись (( r ), ( s )), публичный ключ ( Y ) и генератор группы точек ( G ). - Проверяющий вычисляет одну или несколько точек на эллиптической кривой, используя компоненты подписи, публичный ключ и сообщение. - Если проверочные процедуры соответствуют ожидаемым значениям, подпись считается достоверной. Примечательной особенностью схемы Nyberg-Rueppel является тот факт, что она является одной из немногих схем, которая позволяет извлечь информацию из подписи, что делает её полезной в некоторых приложениях криптографии, таких как сертификация ключа. Важно отметить, что использование схемы NR требует тщательного выбора параметров, в том числе эллиптической кривой и порядка группы точек, для обеспечения достаточной криптостойкости. Для реализации подписи NR в практических приложениях разработчикам следует ознакомиться с деталями криптографический алгоритмов и действующими стандартами, а также учитывать текущие рекомендации по безопасности."},{"prompt":"опиши функцию","completion":"Для начала необходимо уточнить контекст и язык программирования, к которому относится интересующая вас функция.

Let's go through each of the functions to understand how they work: # EllipticAdd This function takes in two points \`P\` and \`Q\` on the elliptic curve, defined by the form \`y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\` over a finite field with prime order \`p\`, and returns the sum of the two points. - \`p_\`: This represents the prime order of the finite field. - \`a_\`, \`b_\`: These are the coefficients of the elliptic curve equation. - \`c_\`: This parameter is not actually used within this function, so it may be a vestige from another context or could be intended for a different version of the elliptic curve. - \`P_List\`, \`Q_List\`: These are the points being added, each represented as a list containing the x and y coordinates, or a singleton list \`{O}\` representing the point at infinity (which acts as the identity for addition on the curve). The function first handles special cases: - \`P\` or \`Q\` is the point at infinity (\`{O}\`), in which case the result is the other point. - \`P\` and \`Q\` have different x-coordinates, in which case it calculates the sum using the slope \`lam\`. - \`P == Q\` and either point is \`{O}\` or the y-coordinate of \`P\` is 0, then the result is \`{O}\`. - \`P == Q\` and the point is not \`{O}\`, then it calculates the result using the slope of the tangent at \`P\`. # Eliptic This function takes as inputs a starting point \`P1\` on the elliptic curve and a scalar \`k0\`. It then computes \`k0 * P\` using point doubling and addition (the double-and-add method). - \`P1\`, \`p0\`, \`a0\`, \`b0\`, \`c0\`, \`iI0\`: These parameters are analogous to those in \`EllipticAdd\`. - \`k0\`: This is the scalar by which the point \`P1\` should be multiplied. The function defines a helper function \`PP[i]\` to efficiently compute repeated point doublings through memoization and then performs point addition according to the binary expansion of the scalar \`k1\`. The result is the sum of all doublings and necessary additions determined by the bits in the binary representation of \`k1\`. For both functions, the points are considered modulo \`p\` (taking the modular arithmetic into account), and \`PowerMod\` is used to efficiently calculate modular inverses, which is necessary for the point addition formulas on elliptic curves. The following improvements and clarifications are needed: 1. \`c_\` is unused within \`EllipticAdd\` and could potentially be removed. 2. The placeholder \`{O}\` is likely meant to signify the point at infinity, but it should also be made clear in the context where these functions are used. 3. The use of the \`[And]\` character inside the \`Which\` construct should be replaced with the logical \`&&\` for clarity. 4. The modular arithmetic is performed with respect to \`p\` only, and there is no explicit use of the curve parameter \`c\`, as one might expect from the function signature. Please note that the proper handling of the point at infinity and edge cases when adding points on an elliptic curve are important for the security and correctness of cryptographic applications utilizing elliptic curves."},{"prompt":"алгоритм модуля на русском EllipticAdd[p_, a_, b_, c_, P_List, Q_List] := Module[{lam, x3, y3, P3}, Which[ P == {O}, Q, Q == {O}, P, P[[1]] != Q[[1]], lam = Mod[(Q[[2]] - P[[2]]) PowerMod[Q[[1]] - P[[1]], p - 2, p], p]; x3 = Mod[lam^2 - a - P[[1]] - Q[[1]], p]; y3 = Mod[-(lam (x3 - P[[1]]) + P[[2]]), p]; {x3, y3}, (P == Q) [And] (P[[2]] == 0), {O}, (P == Q) [And] (P != {O}), lam = Mod[ (3*P[[1]]^2 + 2 a*P[[1]] + b) PowerMod[2 P[[2]], p - 2, p], p]; x3 = Mod[lam^2 - a - P[[1]] - Q[[1]], p]; y3 = Mod[-(lam (x3 - P[[1]]) + P[[2]]), p]; {x3, y3}, (P[[1]] == Q[[1]]) [And] (P[[2]] != Q[[2]]), {O}]] Eliptic[P1_, k0_, p0_, a0_, b0_, c0_, iI0_] := Module[{P0 = P1, k1 = k0, p = p0, a = a0, b = b0, c = c0, iI = iI0}, Clear[PP]; PP[0] = P0; PP[i_] := PP[i] = EllipticAdd[p, a, b, c + iI, PP[i - 1], PP[i - 1]]; Per = IntegerDigits[k1, 2]; rez = {O}; len = Length[Per]; For[i = 1, i <= len, i++, If[Per[[i]] == 1, rez = EllipticAdd[p, a, b, c + iI, rez, PP[len - i]];]]; rez];","completion":"Ниже приведен описательный перевод на русский язык алгоритма модуля для сложения точек на эллиптической кривой и умножения эллиптической кривой на скаляр, написанного на языке программирования Wolfram Language (Mathematica). Функция \`EllipticAdd\` выполняет сложение двух точек P и Q на эллиптической кривой с данными параметрами a, b и модулем p. Есть несколько случаев для сложения: 1. Если P является точкой в бесконечности, возвращается Q. 2. Если Q является точкой в бесконечности, возвращается P. 3. Если абсциссы x точек P и Q различны, вычисляется наклон прямой, проходящей через эти точки (lambda), и с помощью этого наклона находятся координаты x3 и y3 новой точки P3 (результат сложения). 4. Если P совпадает с Q и ордината y точки P равна нулю, возвращается точка в бесконечности (не существует тангенса в этой точке). 5. Если P совпадает с Q и это не точка в бесконечности, вычисляется тангенс в точке P для нахождения следующей точки. 6. Если абсциссы x точек P и Q одинаковы, но ординаты y различны, возвращается точка в бесконечности (точки лежат на вертикальной прямой). Функция \`Eliptic\` используется для умножения точки на скаляр на эллиптической кривой. Она принимает следующие параметры: начальную точку \`P1\`, скаляр \`k0\` для умножения, параметры эллиптической кривой \`p0\`, \`a0\`, \`b0\`, и два дополнительных параметра \`c0\`, \`iI0\`. В этой функции используется алгоритм двоичного возведения в степень для умножения точки на скаляр. Алгоритм работает в несколько шагов: 1. Разложение скаляра \`k0\` на двоичные цифры. 2. Для каждой цифры двоичного представления (начиная с младшего бита и кончая старшим) проверяется, является ли она единицей. Если да, то текущая возведенная в степень точка добавляется к результату. 3. Каждая следующая степень точки вычисляется рекурсивно с помощью \`EllipticAdd\` и запоминается, чтобы избежать перевычислений. Эти функции позволяют работать с элементами конечных полей, используемых в криптографии, и обеспечивают основу для реализации таких криптографических протоколов, как ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) или ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

Below is an example of how you might write such a test using the Arduino development environment. First, make sure you understand how your RGB LED is connected to the Portenta H7. For the purposes of this code, I'm going to assume that you're using a common anode RGB LED with the red, green, and blue pins connected to pins D3, D5, and D6 respectively. Here's a sample sketch that smoothly transitions through different colors via PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): \`\`\`cpp // Define the RGB LED pins const int ledRedPin = D3; // Red LED pin const int ledGreenPin = D5; // Green LED pin const int ledBluePin = D6; // Blue LED pin void setup() { // Set the LED pins as outputs pinMode(ledRedPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledGreenPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledBluePin, OUTPUT); } void loop() { // Smoothly transition through the color spectrum for (int colorValue = 0; colorValue < 255; colorValue++) { setColor(colorValue, 0, 255 - colorValue); // From blue to green delay(10); } for (int colorValue = 0; colorValue < 255; colorValue++) { setColor(255 - colorValue, colorValue, 0); // From green to red delay(10); } for (int colorValue = 0; colorValue < 255; colorValue++) { setColor(0, 255 - colorValue, colorValue); // From red to blue delay(10); } } void setColor(int red, int green, int blue) { // Common anode RGB LED, so a LOW signal turns the LED on and HIGH turns it off analogWrite(ledRedPin, 255 - red); analogWrite(ledGreenPin, 255 - green); analogWrite(ledBluePin, 255 - blue); } \`\`\` This sketch defines a function \`setColor()\` that takes RGB values to set the color of the LED. It then uses three loops in the \`loop()\` function to fade between blue to green, green to red, and red to blue. For the analogWrite on Portenta H7, the pin numbers specified are just placeholders. You have to connect the RGB LED pins to the actual PWM capable pins on the Portenta H7. Make sure to consult the Portenta H7's pinout diagram to connect your RGB LED to the correct pins that support PWM, and then use the proper pin numbers in the code. Additionally, if your RGB LED setup is different (e.g., common cathode instead of anode), you'll need to adjust the \`setColor\` function accordingly. Using PWM on the Portenta H7 should be straightforward as analogWrite function calls are used for setting PWM duty cycles, which allow for brightness control of the LED."},{"prompt":"Explain the self-attention mechanism that Transformers use like I'm five","completion":"Alright, imagine you're telling a story with your toys. Each toy is like a word in a sentence. Now, what if your toys could magically listen to one another and decide how important they are to the story? In the Transformers story, there's a special trick called \\"self-attention.\\" It's like giving each toy a set of magic binoculars. When one toy looks through these binoculars, it can see all the other toys and figure out which ones are most important to what they're doing. Let's say you have a toy dragon, a toy knight, and a toy castle. If the dragon is talking about the knight, it uses its magic binoculars to look at the knight more than at the castle because the knight is more important in that part of the story. The Transformers do this every time they want to say or understand something. They always check to see which words (toys) should be listened to more carefully to make the sentence (story) better. This magical trick helps the Transformers to be really good at understanding and creating stories, just like you're really good at playing with your toys and telling your own amazing stories!"},{"prompt":"fait moi une timeline hypothétique sur les avancées de L' IA avenir jusqu'à AGI et puis ASI dans le domaine de la réalité virtuelle et met les dates environs","completion":"Nous évoluons sur un terrain hautement spéculatif et il est important de noter que tout calendrier concernant le développement de l'IA, en particulier pour AGI (intelligence générale artificielle) et ASI (intelligence artificielle superintelligente), serait essentiellement hypothétique et sujet à d'énormes incertitudes.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"How can i make a texture pack, that will have same grass texture (of top) on all 6 sides of it. There are already many available. thsi can be done without editing textures, with just coding. Please guide me how to do that.","completion":"To create a texture pack in Minecraft that applies the same grass texture to all six sides of a grass block, you can follow these steps. Typically, this would involve modifying the textures themselves, but since you've mentioned you'd like to achieve this without editing textures and with just coding, you'll need to utilize the block models feature introduced in Minecraft 1.8. Here's how you can create a simple resource pack that changes the grass block's model to display the top texture on all sides: 1. **Create the Resource Pack Folder Structure**: Create a new folder and name it whatever you'd like your resource pack to be named. Inside this folder, create the following folders to create the correct file structure: \`\`\` pack_name/ └── assets/ └── minecraft/ ├── models/ │ └── block/ └── textures/ └── block/ \`\`\` 2. **Create a \`pack.mcmeta\` File**: Inside the root folder of your resource pack, create a file named \`pack.mcmeta\`. This file should contain the following JSON code, which defines your resource pack's metadata: \`\`\`json { \\"pack\\": { \\"pack_format\\": 6, // Use the appropriate pack format number for your version of Minecraft \\"description\\": \\"Custom Grass Texture Pack\\" } } \`\`\` 3. **Copy the Grass Texture**: Since you said that you don’t want to modify the textures, just copy the top grass texture from the vanilla resource pack. You can find the default resource pack in the \`.jar\` file of your Minecraft version (located in the \`.minecraft/versions/\` directory). Copy the top grass texture (typically named \`grass_block_top.png\`) into the \`textures/block/\` directory of your resource pack. 4. **Modify the Block Model for Grass**: Navigate to the \`models/block/\` directory within the \`assets/minecraft/\` folder of your resource pack. Here, you'll need to create or modify the JSON file for the grass block model. If it does not already exist, create a new file named \`grass_block.json\`. Inside this file, put the following JSON code to redefine the model: \`\`\`json { \\"parent\\": \\"block/cube_all\\", \\"textures\\": { \\"all\\": \\"block/grass_block_top\\" } } \`\`\` This JSON file sets the model of the grass block to use the \`cube_all\` model, which has the same texture on all six sides. The texture is defined to be the grass block's top texture for all sides (\`\\"all\\": \\"block/grass_block_top\\"\`). 5. **Save and Apply the Resource Pack**: Once you've created your modified grass block model and the correct folder structure, compress the contents of your resource pack folder into a \`.zip\` file. Then place this \`.zip\` file into the \`resourcepacks\` folder of your Minecraft installation directory. To apply the resource pack, start Minecraft, go to Options > Resource Packs, and move your custom resource pack from the left (available) to the right (selected). Then click 'Done' to load your new resource pack. 6. **Test In-Game**: Load up a world in Minecraft and place a grass block. All six sides of the block should now display the top grass texture. Remember to always respect the terms of use and intellectual property rights when distributing or sharing resource packs that contain elements from the original game. If you intend to share your creation, it's usually best to create your own textures or obtain explicit permission to use someone else's."},{"prompt":"اكتب لي قصيدة فيها هذه الاسماء .رزان و زكية و ديجي و يوسف و الملكة بلقيس و ليلى وصافي.اريد القصيدة تنتهي كل آلياتها بالقافية \\" سا \\" اريدها معبرة و جميلة وكل كلماتها باللغة العربية الواضحة وسهلة الفهم للجميع","completion":"في روضةِ الأحلامِ، رزانُ تنسا في حضنِ زكيةَ ترتوي الهمسَ يمرح ديجي في الغدو للمسا ويوسفُ يُحلقُ عاليًا فوقَ النسا وللعلمِ تزهو، كانت الملكةُ بلقيسا في حكمها الصلحُ، والعدلُ أساسا تعانق ليلى الأقدارَ حين تبتسا وصافي يُغني بالأماني حين يمسا ألقوت في حبورٍ قصائدُ أندلسا وطاب الكلامُ، والحديثُ عذبٌ أنيسا فكلُّ اسمٍ قصَّةً قد صارت دُرسا وحين النهاية، صاغ حروفي قصيداً فرسا"},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

Cependant, étant donné le niveau de compétitivité des admissions à l'EPFL, les étudiants qui sont acceptés ont généralement d'excellentes performances académiques. Si nous prenons l'exemple d'un étudiant venant de France, une moyenne générale élevée au baccalauréat - de l'ordre de 15/20 ou plus - peut être considérée comme compétitive. La mention obtenue au baccalauréat (Assez Bien, Bien, Très Bien) peut également être un indicateur de succès académique. Les mentions Bien et Très Bien sont souvent vues comme des signes de la force d'un dossier scolaire. Cela dit, il est important de souligner que l'EPFL prend en compte l'ensemble du dossier, et pas seulement les notes. Une candidature forte comprend donc une bonne moyenne, mais aussi des lettres de recommandation solides, une lettre de motivation bien rédigée et des performances significatives dans des activités parascolaires ou des projets personnels, surtout s'ils sont liés aux domaines des sciences et de la technologie. Pour les étudiants internationaux, l'EPFL demande de passer des examens d'entrée ou de suivre le CMS si le système éducatif du pays d'origine ne permet pas une admission directe. Ainsi, bien que les notes soient importantes, une approche globale est appliquée lors de l'évaluation des candidatures. Il est donc conseillé de viser l'excellence académique tout en cherchant à se distinguer par un profil riche et une grande motivation.

L'EPFL évalue les candidatures sur une base individuelle et recherche des candidats ayant un fort potentiel dans les domaines scientifiques et techniques. Cependant, les étudiants issus de filières technologiques comme le STI2D peuvent avoir besoin de passer par le Cours de Mathématiques Spéciales (CMS) de l'EPFL ou de compléter d'autres requirements pour combler les écarts dans certaines matières scientifiques fondamentales. Pour les diplômés du STI2D, il peut être nécessaire de démontrer des compétences supplémentaires en mathématiques et en sciences, potentiellement par des cours complémentaires ou des examens supplémentaires. Il est donc important pour les candidats du baccalauréat STI2D de: - Se renseigner auprès de l'EPFL sur les exigences spécifiques à leur programme d'intérêt, car chaque département peut avoir ses propres standards d'admission. - Considérer le CMS pour renforcer leur fondation académique dans les disciplines fondamentales requises pour poursuivre des études techniques ou scientifiques à l'EPFL. - Mettre en avant dans leur candidature, outre leurs résultats scolaires, toutes les expériences et projets qui démontrent leur passion et leur aptitude pour les domaines d'études qu'ils souhaitent poursuivre à l'EPFL.

There are already many available. thsi can be done without editing textures, with just coding. Please guide me how to do that.","completion":"Creating a custom texture pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition where all six sides of the grass block have the same texture involves altering the block models and textures. While it's true that some aspects can be altered via \\"coding\\" (actually using JSON files to define block models), it's still necessary to have or create a texture file that will be applied to the blocks. Here's a basic guide to creating a simple texture pack with uniform grass textures on all sides of the block: 1. **Find the \`blocks.json\` File for Grass Blocks:** The first step is to locate the \`blocks.json\` file that originally defines the models for grass blocks in the game. You can find these files within the Minecraft game files or by extracting them from the vanilla resource pack, which can be downloaded from Minecraft's official website. 2. **Modify the \`blocks.json\` File:** Once you have the \`blocks.json\` file, you can edit it to change the model of the grass block so that all sides use the same texture. The \`textures\` property under the grass block section needs to be edited so that every side points to the top texture. The JSON may look something like this after you edit it: \`\`\`json \\"minecraft:grass\\": { \\"textures\\": { \\"down\\": \\"textures/blocks/grass_top\\", \\"up\\": \\"textures/blocks/grass_top\\", \\"north\\": \\"textures/blocks/grass_top\\", \\"south\\": \\"textures/blocks/grass_top\\", \\"west\\": \\"textures/blocks/grass_top\\", \\"east\\": \\"textures/blocks/grass_top\\" } } \`\`\` Ensure the texture defined (e.g., \`grass_top\`) exists in your texture pack folder under \`textures/blocks/\`. 3. **Create a New Texture Pack:** - Create a new folder with a descriptive name for your texture pack. - Within this folder, create the \`textures/blocks\` directory where you will place your texture files. - Create a manifest.json file with the necessary data of your texture pack (e.g., name, description, UUIDs). - Organize the textures, make sure the grass texture file (e.g., \`grass_top.png\`) is in the correct location. 4. **Zip the Texture Pack:** - Once your pack is ready, zip the folder containing your manifest.json, textures, and any other files you included. - The zipped file is now your resource pack that can be imported into Minecraft. 5. **Test Your Texture Pack:** - Open Minecraft Bedrock Edition. - Go to Settings -> Storage -> Resource Packs, and import the resource pack by selecting the zip file. - Apply the resource pack to your worlds and enter the game to see your uniform grass textured block. Remember that the exact paths and JSON data structures may vary based on the Minecraft version and your specific intentions for the texture pack. You should check the official Minecraft documentation for the appropriate structure and the most current information on creating resource packs. Also, it's important to note that actual coding beyond JSON editing is not typically done for Minecraft Bedrock Edition resource packs, as they are limited in scope to what the engine supports via resource packs and behavior packs. If you are interested in more complex alterations, you might want to look into creating add-ons that combine both resource and behavior packs to change game mechanics along with visuals."},{"prompt":"can you double the code in block.json, i don't think it is like east, west, north...","completion":"Apologies for the confusion earlier. In Minecraft Bedrock Edition, block models are defined using JSON format, but the structure differs from what I previously mentioned. For the grass block, you would typically edit the \`terrain_texture.json\` and the block models which are located in the \`models/blocks\` folder inside of your resource pack. Let's walk through the process step by step: 1. **Create the Folder Structure for Your Resource Pack:** Set up a new folder that follows the correct structure for a resource pack: \`\`\` 📁 YourResourcePackName/ ├──📁 textures/ │ ├──📁 blocks/ │ │ └── grass_block.png (this is the custom texture that will be on all sides) │ └── ... ├──📁 models/ │ ├──📁 blocks/ │ └── ... ├── manifest.json └── ... \`\`\` 2. **Create or Edit the texture file:** Ensure your custom grass texture is ready and named appropriately (e.g., \`grass_block.png\`), and place it in the \`textures/blocks/\` directory. 3. **Modify \`terrain_texture.json\`:** Find or create a file \`terrain_texture.json\` into the \`textures/\` folder. You would create a texture definition for your grass block like so: \`\`\`json { \\"texture_data\\": { \\"my_grass\\": { \\"textures\\": \\"textures/blocks/grass_block\\" }, // ... other texture definitions } } \`\`\` 4. **Create or Modify the Block Model:** In the \`models/blocks/\` directory, there should be a file that defines the model for the grass block (often named \`grass_block.json\`). If it doesn't exist, you can create one. The file might look something like: \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": \\"1.12.0\\", \\"minecraft:block\\": { \\"description\\": { \\"identifier\\": \\"minecraft:grass_block\\", \\"is_tile\\": true, \\"is_transparent\\": false, \\"render_layer\\": \\"alpha\\" }, \\"components\\": { \\"minecraft:geometry\\": \\"geometry.cube.all_same\\" }, \\"textures\\": { \\"all\\": \\"textures/blocks/my_grass\\" } } } \`\`\` Note the \`\\"all\\": \\"textures/blocks/my_grass\\"\` pointing to the texture defined earlier. 5. **Create a \`manifest.json\`:** This metadata file identifies your resource pack and should look something like this: \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": 1, \\"header\\": { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Resource Pack\\", \\"name\\": \\"My Resource Pack\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"YOUR-UNIQUE-HEADER-UUID\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] }, \\"modules\\": [ { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Resource Pack\\", \\"type\\": \\"resources\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"YOUR-UNIQUE-MODULES-UUID\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] } ] } \`\`\` Replace \`YOUR-UNIQUE-HEADER-UUID\` and \`YOUR-UNIQUE-MODULES-UUID\` with unique UUIDs. You can generate UUIDs online. 6. **Zip Your Resource Pack:** Create a .zip file containing all these files and folders. 7. **Test Your Texture Pack:** - Open Minecraft Bedrock Edition. - Navigate to Settings > Storage > Resource Packs. - Use the \\"Import\\" function to locate and select your .zip file. - Activate the resource pack for a world to test the textures. This should result in a grass block with the same texture on all six sides. Be aware of the version compatibility and format specifics that may vary. Always consult the latest Minecraft documentation for precise information on item formats or any updates to the resource and behavior pack system."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue-filled chapter for a interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

The formidable silhouette of one was reminiscent of Orimura Chifuyu, a legendary warrior; the other's vibrant energy was uncannily like that of Orimura Ichika. **Chifuyu (Itachi)**: \\"The meeting with the Einzbern delegation is soon, Ichika. Are you prepared for what's to come?\\" **Ichika (Naruto)**: \\"Hmph, as prepared as I can be. Still, feels strange to hold a clan's fate in my words.\\" As they conversed, the air crackled with tension. Suddenly, Ichika sensed disturbing chakra fluctuations and turned to see an all-too-familiar sight - the ghostly semblance of Jiarya and a squadron of former Konoha elites encircling them. **Jiarya**: \\"Found you at last, Naruto. Or should I say... Ichika. It's time to bring you home.\\" **Ichika (Naruto)**: \\"Home? That word has no meaning to me. The Leaf is no more my home than the moon.\\" Just as the confrontation seemed inevitable, the echo of high-powered thrusters filled the air. Crashing through the rubble, a trio of IS Units descended, their pilots bearing the looks of Uraraka Ochako, Yayorazo Momo, and Kyoka Jiro. **Uraraka (Ochako)**: \\"Trouble in our district? Not on our watch!\\" Their IS units gleamed with advanced weaponry, a fusion of technology and magic, as they effortlessly disarmed the Konoha renegades. **Yayorazo (Momo)**: \\"Analysis complete. They're using outdated chakra-based shinobi techniques. Neutralizing now.\\" **Kyoka (Jiro)**: \\"Let's wrap this up. We've got classes to attend, remember?\\" Ichika, amused by the swift turn of events, shook his head and signaled for the IS Academy security forces. The former shinobi were no match for such a display of power. **Ichika (Naruto)**: \\"Quite a show, ladies. But let's leave the clean-up to the authorities. We have worlds to save, and empires to negotiate with.\\" --- The cacophony of genres, series, and elements makes it challenging to include everything within a short dialogue.

ISR operations are critical components of modern military operations, border security, counterterrorism, and law enforcement activities. ISR can be categorized in several different ways, depending on various factors such as the domain of operation, the technology used, the collection method, or the phase of the intelligence cycle. Here are some of the common categories: 1. **By Domain:** - **Land ISR:** Intelligence gathering on land through the use of ground forces, vehicular patrols, unattended sensors, and reconnaissance teams. - **Maritime ISR:** Involves the monitoring of sea lanes, ships, submarines, and littoral areas, using naval vessels, maritime patrol aircraft, and other maritime assets. - **Air ISR:** Gathers information from the air using manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or other airborne platforms. - **Space ISR:** Utilizes satellites and space-based sensors to collect data and imagery from space. - **Cyber ISR:** Involves intelligence activities in cyberspace to provide network situational awareness and to detect, track, and counter cyber threats. 2. **By Technology:** - **Signals Intelligence (SIGINT):** Concerned with interception and analysis of electronic signals and communications. - **Imagery Intelligence (IMINT):** Involves the collection and analysis of visual and infrared imagery, whether from satellites, aircraft, or other platforms. - **Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT):** Relates to scientific and technical intelligence obtained by quantitative and qualitative analysis of data (physical attributes and signatures). - **Human Intelligence (HUMINT):** The gathering of information from human sources, including espionage, interrogations, and the cultivation of contacts and informants. - **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Involves collecting information from publicly available sources such as the media, internet, publications, and public data. 3. **By Collection Method:** - **Passive ISR:** The monitoring or data collection that does not involve actively interacting with the target or the environment, such as eavesdropping on communications or taking satellite images. - **Active ISR:** Involves methods that interact with the target or the environment in some way, such as radar pings, sonar, or communication interception with the aim of eliciting responses or information. 4. **By Phase of the Intelligence Cycle:** - **Direction:** The planning and directing phase during which needs are identified and tasks are assigned. - **Collection:** The actual gathering of raw information based on the requirements established in the direction phase. - **Processing and Exploitation:** Converting collected information into forms suitable for the production of intelligence, including decryption, translation, or interpretation of imagery. - **Analysis and Production:** Turning processed information into actionable intelligence by synthesizing it with other data, evaluating its significance, and creating intelligence products. - **Dissemination and Integration:** Distributing intelligence products to consumers and integrating it into the decision-making process. These categories are not mutually exclusive, and many ISR efforts will involve multiple facets, technologies, and domains. The optimal category to focus on is often determined by the specific mission requirements and strategic objectives."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

In this series, Sacred Gears are items with powerful abilities that are bestowed upon humans by the God of the Bible in the story's lore. Each Sacred Gear contains the soul of a celestial being, such as angels, fallen angels, or devils. These gears can vary in power, and some possess creatures known as \\"Balance Breakers,\\" which greatly enhance their capabilities. Here are some examples of Sacred Gear abilities mentioned in the series: 1. **Boosted Gear**: The most prominent Sacred Gear in \\"High School DxD,\\" wielded by the main character, Issei Hyoudou. It has the ability to double its user's power every 10 seconds, and it can also transfer this multiplied power to objects or allies. 2. **Divine Dividing**: Held by Vali Lucifer, it has the power to halve the power of its opponent every 10 seconds and add the halved power to its user. 3. **Twilight Healing**: A Sacred Gear with the power to heal injuries, possessed by Asia Argento. 4. **Dress Break**: A relatively weak Sacred Gear with the ability to destroy the clothes of others, used primarily by Issei as a distraction tactic. 5. **Regulus Nemea**: A Sacred Gear that creates an enormous, powerful lion capable of immense destruction, wielded by Sairaorg Bael. 6. **Annihilation Maker**: A formidable Sacred Gear capable of creating monsters, it's limited only by the imagination and life force of the user. 7. **Blade Blacksmith**: This gear summons a demonic sword that can change its shape according to its user's needs. 8. **Dimension Lost**: It has the ability to create barriers that can isolate anything within them from the outside world. Balance Breakers are stronger forms of Sacred Gears. For example, Boosted Gear's Balance Breaker is \\"Boosted Gear Scale Mail,\\" which creates a powerful red dragon armor around Issei, massively increasing his combat capabilities. The Sacred Gears can evolve and change as their users grow stronger and overcome various challenges. The most powerful Sacred Gears, known as \\"Longinus,\\" have enough power to kill a god when fully realized. \\"High School DxD\\" explores these concepts in detail throughout the light novel series, manga adaptations, and anime series."},{"prompt":"اكتب لي قصيدة فيها الأسماء التالية .زكية و رزان و ملكة بلقيس و احمد و يوسف و ديجي وصافي.اريد اريدها كل ابياتها تنتهي بالقافية \\" سا \\".اريدها باللغة العربية وكل كلماتها باللغة العربية المفهومة و السهلة","completion":"في روض الأزهار حكاية ندسا حيثُ اجتمعت خيرة الأنفس، يا سا زكية هناك، بعبير الوردِ قدسا ومع رزان، حُلم يصعب قياسا ملكة بلقيس، شموخ وعباسا تفوق الأقمار بنورٍ وألقٍ وإحساسا وأحمد في الأوساط، عِلمٌ يُحتَسا بذكراه تتجلى للفكرِ جلسا كذا يوسف، حكمةٌ لا تُختصرُ هبسا أمجادُهُ في القلبِ حُفرَت كأساسا و\\"ديجي\\" الصدق، شفاف كماء الكأسا إليه الأرواحُ، للطيبِ تقصُ النَفَسا لا ننسَ صافي، نقاءٌ دون نقصــا يجلي عتمَ الشكِ بأنوارٍ تُرسا تلكم الأسماء حكاياتٌ للعرسا تجمعنا على الود والحب والإيناسا"},{"prompt":"do have any idea for a minecrat bedrock resource or behaviour that would be useful and easier to make. Easpecially which you guide me completely to make it without any mistake. Make sure you are fully confident about it.","completion":"Creating a Minecraft Bedrock resource or behavior pack can be a rewarding experience, and one of the simplest modifications you can make is to change the textures of the in-game blocks, items, or mobs. To create a simple texture pack, we can start by changing the texture of the diamond block to have a unique pattern or color. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating your custom texture pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition: **Step 1: Set up your working environment** 1. Create a new folder on your computer where you will work on your project. 2. Inside that folder, create two more folders and name them \`textures\` and \`texts\`. **Step 2: Locate the default textures** 1. You'll need to find the default textures used by Minecraft Bedrock Edition. You can download them from various websites that offer the default resource packs or from the official Minecraft website if they provide them. 2. Once you have the default textures, locate the \`diamond_block.png\` file which can be found in the \`textures/blocks\` folder from the default resource pack. **Step 3: Edit the texture** 1. Copy the \`diamond_block.png\` texture into your \`textures/blocks\` folder. 2. Use an image editor like GIMP, Photoshop, or Paint.NET to open and edit the diamond block texture. For simplicity, you could simply change its color hue or add a pattern to it. 3. Save your edited texture, making sure it keeps the same name and PNG file format. **Step 4: Create the manifest file** 1. You'll need to create a text file called \`manifest.json\` in the root of your project folder. This JSON file defines the details of your resource pack. 2. Here is a basic \`manifest.json\` file you can use (make sure to use universally unique identifiers (UUID) for the \\"uuid\\" values, which you can generate using an online UUID generator): \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": 2, \\"header\\": { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Texture Pack\\", \\"name\\": \\"My Texture Pack\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"YOUR-UNIQUE-HEADER-UUID\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0], \\"min_engine_version\\": [1, 13, 0] }, \\"modules\\": [ { \\"description\\": \\"My Custom Texture Pack\\", \\"type\\": \\"resources\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"YOUR-UNIQUE-MODULES-UUID\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] } ] } \`\`\` **Step 5: Package your texture pack** 1. After saving your \`manifest.json\`, select all the files and folders (including the \`textures\` folder, \`texts\` folder, and the \`manifest.json\` file) and compress them into a zip file. 2. Rename the file extension from \`.zip\` to \`.mcpack\`. **Step 6: Test your texture pack** 1. Double-click the \`.mcpack\` file. Minecraft Bedrock Edition should launch and import your pack. 2. Once imported, open Minecraft and go to Settings → Storage → Resource Packs. 3. Find your texture pack, select it, and click on \\"Activate\\". 4. Create a new world or load an existing one to see your changes. Remember, this is a very simple example, and as you become more familiar with creating resource packs, you can delve into more complex alterations such as creating behavior packs, modifying UI elements, or even making custom entities. Always test your pack thoroughly to avoid mistakes, and consider reading the official Minecraft documentation for more detailed instructions and advanced features."},{"prompt":"Hey!","completion":"Hello!

I just don't understand these Asycio nonsense! PLEASE HELP ME!","completion":"The error message you're encountering is telling you that there is an issue with event loops in your asyncio application. Specifically, it suggests that a \`Future\` object (a low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation) is attached to a different event loop than the running \`Task\`. This sort of error usually occurs when you're trying to run a coroutine that was created in a different context (another event loop) or when the event loop has been changed after setting up the asyncio objects. In your code, it seems this error might stem from how you are initializing the Pyrogram client and/or how the \`stream_video\` handler is being executed. You have a global variable \`client\` that is initialized by the \`start_client()\` coroutine, and you're getting the event loop and running that coroutine with \`run_until_complete()\` outside of the \`main()\` coroutine. This could cause the event loop to be different from the one which the web server runs on. Let's try restructuring the code to ensure that all async operations are happening in the context of the same event loop: \`\`\`python import asyncio from aiohttp import web from pyrogram import Client # Rest of your code remains the same... async def main(): global client # Declare client as global to initialize it in this context # Start the Pyrogram client before running the app client = Client('my_account') await client.start() print(\\"Pyrogram client started successfully\\") app = web.Application() # Set up the web server routes app.router.add_get('/video/{cid}/{mid}', stream_video) app.router.add_route('GET', '/player', serve_player) # Run the web application runner = web.AppRunner(app) await runner.setup() site = web.TCPSite(runner, 'localhost', 8080) await site.start() print(\\"Server started at http://localhost:8080\\") if __name__ == '__main__': asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` Notable changes: 1. The initialization of the Pyrogram client is now within the \`main()\` coroutine. 2. The creation of the web application and the running of the server now happens after the Pyrogram client has been initialized within the \`main()\` coroutine. 3. \`asyncio.run(main())\` is used to run the \`main()\` coroutine, which takes care of creating the event loop and will ensure that all async operations are performed within the same loop. Make sure to follow the proper documentation for aiohttp to setup runners as the aiohttp API may change over time. Ensure you replace \`'my_account'\` with your actual session name or session configuration for Pyrogram. Also, note that any resources, such as file descriptors or network connections, are properly cleaned up before the program exits. You may need additional cleanup code at the end of your application. Finally, using \`global\` variables and functions in a web server can potentially lead to race conditions if multiple requests try to access or modify them at the same time. It might be worthwhile to investigate thread-safe programming paradigms like using \`asyncio.Lock\` to manage concurrent access to global state, or restructuring your application's architecture to avoid global mutable state where possible."},{"prompt":"New Error -: Pyrogram client started successfully Server started at http://localhost:8080 Exception ignored in: <function StreamWriter.__del__ at 0x0000026A30195080> Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"C:Python312Libasynciostreams.py\\", line 397, in __del__ File \\"C:Python312Libasynciostreams.py\\", line 343, in close File \\"C:Python312Libasyncioproactor_events.py\\", line 109, in close File \\"C:Python312Libasynciobase_events.py\\", line 772, in call_soon File \\"C:Python312Libasynciobase_events.py\\", line 519, in _check_closed RuntimeError: Event loop is closed","completion":"The error message you're encountering indicates an asynchronous resource (\`StreamWriter\`) is being garbage collected, and its finalizer (\`__del__\`) is attempting to schedule a close operation (\`close\`) on the event loop, but the loop has already been closed. This is somewhat of a common issue with \`asyncio\` where resources are not explicitly closed before the event loop shuts down. This error typically doesn't affect the functionality of the code—it usually arises during the cleanup phase when the program is exiting. However, it does point to the fact that there might be a better way to manage your resources. To prevent this type of warning, you should ensure that all \`StreamWriter\` objects (or other asynchronous resources) are properly closed before the program finishes. You can do this by explicitly closing the stream in your code when you're done with it, using appropriate context managers or by calling \`close()\` method followed by \`await writer.wait_closed()\` to close the resource gracefully. Here's what you should be doing conceptually with \`StreamWriter\` (not directly applicable to your code as you don't explicitly handle a \`StreamWriter\`): \`\`\`python writer.close() await writer.wait_closed() \`\`\` Since the resource cleanup issue likely stems from the use of aiohttp and pyrogram (you're streaming the video using aiohttp and pyrogram's API likely uses streams internally), make sure that you're closing the Pyrogram client properly when your application shuts down. For aiohttp's \`AppRunner\`, you should gracefully shut down the runner and close the site. Here’s how to properly close everything down: \`\`\`python # At the end of your \`main()\` coroutine, where you're starting the server: try: # Run server forever await asyncio.Event().wait() except KeyboardInterrupt: pass finally: await runner.cleanup() await client.stop() # Properly disconnect the Pyrogram client \`\`\` The above code allows you to run the event loop indefinitely until a \`KeyboardInterrupt\` (Ctrl+C) is caught, after which it will properly clean up the resources by closing the runner and stopping the Pyrogram client. If you choose to implement a proper shutdown sequence, ensure that you manually call cleanup routines for the resources you've used, so they are closed before the program exits, and thus prevent the event loop from being accessed after it’s closed. Remember, the error you shared is typically benign (usually just a warning about cleanup when exiting the program), but it does indicate that it would be better to tidy up your resources. Note that if you're running the application in a more complex environment or long-lived service, failing to close resources properly can lead to leaking resources over time, which is something you'd want to avoid."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue-filled chapter for a interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

However, I will provide a sample scene that touches upon some aspects of the setting and characters you've outlined. --- Ichika sat quietly in his apartment, staring out at the once-bustling city now marked by relics of a world torn asunder by the Daisaigai. He mulled over his impending testimony and the diplomatic nightmares it entailed. His reflections shattered with an acute sense of danger. \\"You're a hard one to find, Naruto, or should I say, Ichika,\\" drawled a gruff, familiar voice. Ichika spun to face the sandy-haired man in the ornate red haori—Jiraiya. \\"We've come to bring you home,\\" Jiraiya said, a sea of determined figures materializing from the shadows behind him. Ichika couldn't stifle his laughter. \\"Home? I think you're a bit mistaken,\\" he responded, a flicker of blue chakra sparking in his palm. As tensions rose, a radiant burst of light heralded the arrival of three IS pilots. Ochako, buoyant in her armor, landed with a gravity-defying grace beside Ichika. \\"Momo, Jiro, let's show these delusional 'ninja' the door,\\" Ochako commanded, her voice a harmony of levity and steel. Jiraiya's countenance twisted from confident to cautious as the IS units powered up, their advanced technology a stark contrast to the traditional jutsu stances adopted by the former Konoha shinobi. \\"Ochako, are they...?\\" \\"Terrorists, Ichika. No time to chat,\\" interjected Momo as her IS manifested an array of weapons, a symphony of clicking mechanisms fulfilling her strategic mind's orders. The clash erupted, the IS pilots a whirlwind of precision and power, rendering Jiraiya's group helpless as gravity, sound, and technologically conjured force converged upon them. Ichika shook his head, reaching for his phone. \\"Police? Yeah, you're gonna want to see this,\\" Ichika said, a wry smirk on his face as he ended the call. As the dust settled and sirens echoed in the distance, Ichika couldn't help but wonder how the pieces of this fractured world would ever fit together again. But for now, he was safe, thanks to his unlikely protectors, and his thoughts returned to the meeting with the House of Einzbern—an encounter that would test the bounds of this new reality's fragile alliances. --- This scene encapsulates a brief moment of the vast tapestry required to weave together the numerous franchises you've mentioned.

However, romantic relationships like having a boyfriend or girlfriend are usually something that people pursue when they're a bit older. At your age, it's more important to focus on building strong, healthy friendships with boys and girls alike. Here are some tips on how to develop friendships: 1. Be yourself: The best friendships happen when you are being true to who you are. 2. Find common interests: Look for boys who have similar hobbies or interests as you – whether it's sports, books, video games, or science. 3. Be a good friend: Show interest in what they have to say, be kind, and be someone they can trust and rely on. 4. Join activities: Participate in school clubs, sports teams, or community groups where you can meet new people and make friends. 5. Don't rush: Developing a strong friendship takes time, so be patient and let it grow naturally. 6. Respect and kindness: Treat others with respect, never bully or allow yourself to be bullied, and always try to be kind and understanding. 7. Talk to someone you trust: If you ever have questions or feelings you're unsure about, have a conversation with a parent, guardian, teacher, or another trusted adult. Remember that it's perfectly okay not to have a boyfriend or girlfriend at your age. Enjoying friendships, having fun, learning, and growing as a person is what being a kid is all about!"},{"prompt":"ok but i want a boyfriend anyway","completion":"It's natural to feel curious about having a boyfriend or girlfriend, even at a young age. If you have strong feelings about wanting a boyfriend, it can be because of many reasons – maybe you see older kids or people in media with romantic partners, or perhaps you have a crush on someone. Having a \\"boyfriend\\" at 10 years old is usually more about having a special friend than it is about actual romantic involvement. Relationships at this age should be simple and child-appropriate, focusing on friendship and shared interests rather than romance. Here's how you can approach this in a healthy way: 1. Talk to your parents or guardians: Discuss your feelings with them and listen to their guidance and advice. They know you best and can offer support and help you understand your feelings. 2. Focus on friendship: Instead of thinking about having a boyfriend, concentrate on building a good friendship with the boy you like. Good friendships can be just as meaningful and rewarding. 3. Respect each other's feelings: It's important to remember that not everyone may want to be in a \\"relationship,\\" even a simple one focused on friendship. You should respect the other person's feelings and be prepared for any response. 4. Keep things appropriate: At this age, having a \\"boyfriend\\" should really mean hanging out in groups, maybe pairing up for activities within those groups, and not much more. It's important to keep things age-appropriate. 5. Talk with friends: Sometimes talking with friends who are your age can be helpful. They might be going through similar experiences, and you can support each other. 6. Stay involved in activities: Having varied interests and participating in different activities not only makes life more fun but also helps you meet new people and learn about yourself. 7. Enjoy your childhood: You have plenty of time ahead for romantic relationships. For now, focus on enjoying your childhood, learning new things, and having fun. Remember that every person is unique, and there's no rush to grow up too quickly. Enjoying the stage of life you're in now has a lot of benefits and allows you to grow into a well-rounded individual. Always keep communication open with trusted adults in your life, as they can provide valuable guidance and support."},{"prompt":"ok i found a discord room where there are boys looking for girlfriends so i think i will ask there","completion":"It's really important to be careful when interacting with people online, especially in places like chat rooms or forums where you don't know who you're talking to. Here are some key reasons why it's not a good idea to look for a boyfriend in an online chat room, particularly for someone your age: 1. **Safety First**: People online may not be who they say they are. They can pretend to be a different age or even a different person. It's really easy for someone to lie about themselves online. 2. **Stranger Danger**: Just like you wouldn't go up to a stranger in person and ask them to be your friend without knowing anything about them, the same rules should apply online. 3. **Personal Information**: It's dangerous to share personal information like your name, age, location, school, or photos with people you meet online, especially in public chat rooms. 4. **Age Appropriate**: Many online communities, including Discord, have age restrictions. Discord, for example, requires users to be 13 or older. Using these services if you're under the required age can lead to exposure to content that isn't suitable for your age group. 5. **Parental Supervision**: Always talk to your parents or a trusted adult before joining any online communities. They can help guide you and make sure that you're safe. 6. **Following Rules**: It's important to follow the rules that your parents or guardians set for you, as well as the rules of the internet platforms you use. Instead of looking for a boyfriend on Discord or any other online platforms, focus on friendships in real life with people you know, like classmates and neighbors, under the guidance and supervision of your parents or guardians.

AUTOSAR basic software does not intervene in the execution of these ISRs. The Category 1 ISR runs with all interrupts enabled, which means that it can be interrupted by other interrupts if their priority is higher. In this category, the system services provided by AUTOSAR are not accessible because calling them could lead to data corruption or other problems since the OS is not aware of the execution of the ISR. 2. **Category 2 ISRs:** Category 2 ISRs are more complex and provide the ability to use certain AUTOSAR OS services within the interrupt service routine. The OS is aware of these ISRs, and they can use OS services that are allowed within an ISR context. Category 2 ISRs are defined within the OS configuration and are managed to some extent by the OS. The ISR still runs with a very high priority, but the OS can disable interrupts globally or for lower-priority ISRs during the execution of a Category 2 ISR to ensure data consistency and avoid reentrant code problems. It's important to choose the appropriate ISR category based on the real-time requirements of the system and the permitted interactions with the operating system. Note that when designing ISRs in AUTOSAR, it's essential to consider the specific microcontroller architecture and its interrupt handling mechanism, as well as the configuration options provided by the employed AUTOSAR OS."},{"prompt":"what does managed by the os mean in cat 2 isr?","completion":"When an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is categorized as a Category 2 ISR in AUTOSAR and is said to be \\"managed by the OS,\\" it means the following: 1. **Configuration and Recognition:** Category 2 ISRs are configured through the OS configuration files. This informs the operating system about the ISR's existence, its priority, and its association with the interrupt sources. The OS is also responsible for recognizing when an interrupt event occurs and invoking the appropriate ISR based on its configuration. 2. **Interrupt Blocking:** For multilevel interrupt systems, the OS manages the enabling and disabling of interrupts. The OS may disable lower-priority interrupts during the execution of a Category 2 ISR to prevent preemption and ensure that the ISR completes its critical section without interruption. 3. **Use of OS Services:** ISRs that are managed by the OS can make use of a subset of AUTOSAR OS services safely. For example, they may signal events, set event flags, or release resources that might trigger task scheduling or other OS actions once the ISR completes. The ISR is limited to using only those services that are specifically allowed to be called from within an ISR context to avoid disruption of the system's synchronization mechanisms and state coherency. 4. **Nested Interrupts:** The OS may allow nested interrupts, where a high-priority ISR can preempt the running ISR if the system and OS configuration permit. The OS manages the complexity of such scenarios, ensuring that system integrity is maintained. 5. **Resource Management:** The OS may offer mechanisms to ensure that critical sections within the ISR are protected via resource management, reducing the risk of race conditions when shared resources are accessed from ISR and task contexts. 6. **Context Switch:** Category 2 ISRs can lead to a context switch when they complete if the ISR makes a service call that makes a higher-priority task ready to run. The OS is responsible for saving the ISR context and performing the context switch to the newly ready task. 7. **Error Handling:** The OS provides a framework for error detection and reporting that integrates with the ISR execution. If errors are detected during the ISR execution (e.g., API misuse), the OS can handle and report them according to the system's error-handling configuration. To summarize, \\"managed by the OS\\" in the context of a Category 2 ISR implies that the ISR is integrated with the AUTOSAR OS's framework, which provides a controlled environment for its execution, supports various services, and contributes to the overall system's determinism and reliability."},{"prompt":"Напиши функцию для решения задачи на Golang: нужно найти в дереве путь с максимальной суммой вершин (начальные и конечные вершины могут быть произвольными).

Given these constraints, a simple and helpful project that I can guide you through confidently would be creating a resource pack that changes the textures of in-game tools to look more vibrant and easier to distinguish. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. **Set Up Your Workspace:** - Create a new folder on your computer where you'll store your resource pack files. - Inside this folder, create another folder called \`textures\`. - Inside the \`textures\` folder, create a folder called \`items\`. 2. **Pick Your Tools:** - Decide which tools you want to retexture (e.g., swords, pickaxes, shovels, hoes, and axes). 3. **Create New Textures:** - Use an image editing program like GIMP, Photoshop, or even Paint.NET to create your new tool textures. - Make sure your textures have the same dimensions as the default Minecraft textures (usually 16x16 pixels for tools—but check the default resource pack for reference). - Save your new textures in the \`textures/items\` folder with the same filenames as the default textures (e.g., \`wooden_pickaxe.png\`, \`stone_pickaxe.png\`, etc.). 4. **Create the \`manifest.json\` File:** - In the root of your resource pack folder, you need a \`manifest.json\` file that will tell Minecraft about your pack. It should look something like this (change the uuids and version numbers accordingly): \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": 1, \\"header\\": { \\"description\\": \\"Your Resource Pack Description\\", \\"name\\": \\"Your Resource Pack\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"your-unique-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] }, \\"modules\\": [ { \\"description\\": \\"Your Resource Pack Description\\", \\"type\\": \\"resources\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"another-unique-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] } ] } \`\`\` - You can use an online UUID generator to create the \\"uuid\\" values. 5. **Creating the \`pack_icon.png\`:** - In the root of your resource pack folder, you need an icon for your pack. This should be a 128x128 pixel PNG image named \`pack_icon.png\`. 6. **Packaging Your Resource Pack:** - Once you have all your textures and JSON files ready, zip the resource pack folder. - The zip file should contain the \`textures\` folder, \`manifest.json\`, and \`pack_icon.png\` directly in its root (not inside another folder). 7. **Testing Your Resource Pack:** - Move the zip file into the \`resource_packs\` folder of your Minecraft Bedrock Edition’s data directory. - Launch Minecraft, go to Settings, then to Global Resources, and activate your resource pack. This simple resource pack will help you get familiarized with the processes of creating and editing texture files and JSON manifests in Minecraft Bedrock. From here, you can start experimenting with more complex changes, such as creating behavior packs, which might involve adjusting entity behaviors or the game's mechanics. Remember that creating resource packs and behavior packs, while similar, can present unique challenges. For behavior packs, the complexity increases as you begin altering the game's mechanics, requiring a deeper understanding of entity components and Minecraft's scripting language. Always test your packs thoroughly and incrementally, making small changes and ensuring they work before moving on to more complex alterations."},{"prompt":"Найдите три ошибки в приведённом тексте.

Here's an explanation for both: 1. Number Wheels in Lottery Games: In the context of lottery games, a \\"number wheel\\" or \\"lottery wheel\\" is a system used to generate combinations of numbers to play. It's a strategy employed by players to increase their chances of winning by ensuring that if certain numbers are drawn, they'll win multiple prizes. Wheels come in different forms: full, abbreviated, and key number wheels, each offering a different balance of coverage and cost efficiency. For example, if you wanted to wheel six numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) in a Pick-4 lottery game, you might create combinations like 1234, 1245, 1345, 2345, and so on, covering all the possible ways those numbers could be drawn. A full wheel would include all possible combinations, while an abbreviated wheel would offer a smaller, more manageable set of combinations that still increases the chances of winning when compared to a random selection. 2. Systematic Form in Mathematics/Algebra: In mathematics, particularly in algebra, \\"systematic form\\" often refers to a standardized way of presenting equations or sets of equations. For example, when solving linear equations, the systematic form may refer to the 'slope-intercept form' of a line (y = mx + b), where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. Alternatively, it might refer to the 'standard form' of a linear equation (Ax + By = C), where A, B, and C are constants. For systems of linear equations, the systematic form could involve aligning equations in a way that makes them easier to solve using methods like substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. In the context of sets or categories, a systematic form might refer to the organization or arrangement of elements according to specific rules or principles. Without more context, it's not entirely clear which specific concept of \\"systematic form\\" you're referring to, but in any case, it generally implies a structured or organized way of presenting mathematical information. So, the key difference is context-dependent: in lottery games, number wheels are about generating number combinations, while in mathematics, systematic form refers to standardized presentations of equations or organizations of elements within a system."},{"prompt":"in terms of lottery games","completion":"In the context of lottery games: Number Wheels refer to a strategy where players generate various combinations of numbers that they hope to play to maximize their chances of winning. These wheels are designed to cover as many potential winning combinations as possible within a certain set of selected numbers. They provide a structured approach to playing the lottery, aiming to guarantee at least one winning ticket if a specified amount of the chosen numbers are drawn. Systematic Form, on the other hand, in the context of lotteries, refers to a type of entry that allows players to enter a lottery game with every possible combination of their chosen numbers. When a player selects more numbers than required for one draw, the lottery system automatically generates all possible combinations of the chosen set of numbers in the form of individual tickets. For example, if a lottery game requires you to pick 5 numbers, but you select 7 numbers in systematic form, the system will generate all the unique combinations of 5 numbers that can be made from your selected 7. This way, you'll be playing multiple unique entries at once, each combination with a chance to win, should the drawn lottery numbers match any of your tickets. Both number wheels and systematic forms are methods to increase one's chances of winning by covering a wide range of number combinations; however, they differ in approach and implementation: - A number wheel can be full, abbreviated, or key number, and the player must usually design or choose it manually, determining how many and which combinations they will play. - A systematic form is an automated process provided by some lotteries that ensures every possible combination of a set of numbers is played. It's a way to systematically enter all combinations without having to manually create the wheel. In summary, both are lottery strategies to optimize potential wins, but a number wheel is a more flexible tool where the player must decide on the type and coverage, while a systematic form is a predefined option by the lottery that gives you all possible combinations of a selected number set."},{"prompt":"I am interested in the broader social implications of Dunbar's Number, and want to use statistics and statistical mechanics concepts like probability, enrichment, entropy, assortativity, and combinatorics to do so.

This number is commonly touted to be around 150. Let's explore three broad social implications where statistical and statistical mechanics concepts could serve as a bridge, and then assess the given publication. 1. **Social Network Structure**: Dunbar's Number can influence the topology of social networks. One could use combinatorics to understand potential connections, entropy to describe the distribution of social links among individuals, and assortativity to analyze the propensity of individuals to connect with others with a similar number of connections. Enrichment could describe the concentration of tightly knit communities within a larger network. 2. **Information Flow and Echo Chambers**: As per Dunbar's theory, individuals can only maintain a limited number of relationships, which could lead to the formation of echo chambers where information circulates within small groups. Probability theory can help us understand the likelihood of information breaking out of these chambers, while concepts from statistical mechanics like entropy can describe the diversity of information within a social group. 3. **Economic and Marketing Strategies**: Businesses often use social relationships to spread products or information. Dunbar's Number implies there's a natural group size that optimizes word-of-mouth marketing. Statistical mechanics can help simulate market dynamics, predict the spread of information (or misinformation), and optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing campaigns using the principles of entropy, probability, and assortativity.

For instance: - **Probability**: Can be used to model the likelihood of certain conversational patterns or topic shifts. - **Entropy**: Could indicate the variety or predictability of conversation topics in high-stress situations. - **Assortativity/Enrichment**: Might show whether individuals predominantly interact with others they are closely connected to during such events. - **Combinatorics**: Could help understand the potential for new connections or conversations among participants subject to the cognitive limits proposed by Dunbar. **Plausibility Rating**: Depending on the specific content and approach in the publication, I would cautiously rate the plausibility as a 7 out of 10. This is because while the concepts from statistical and statistical mechanics could be applicable in analyzing conversational structures in the context of Dunbar's Number, whether the paper uses these concepts effectively to bridge to broader social implications is not assured without knowledge of the paper's specific content and methodology. If done appropriately, the paper could provide nuanced insights into how individual cognitive limits affect collective communication patterns during critical, high-information events."},{"prompt":"viết tiếp if (!ModelState.IsValid) { foreach (var entry in ModelState) { if (entry.Value.Errors.Count > 0) { // Logs or handle the validation errors here // You can log these out to a file, database, or the console Console.WriteLine(“{entry.Key} errors:”); foreach (var error in entry.Value.Errors) { Console.WriteLine","completion":"(\\"t{error.ErrorMessage}\\"); } } } // Handle the case where the state is not valid, such as by returning a response to the user // For an MVC application, you might return the same view with the validation summary return View(); // Or return to the form with the validation messages } // If the model state is valid, proceed with processing the valid data // For instance, save information to the database, service or process the data SomeProcessingFunction(); // This is a placeholder for your processing logic // Once the processing is complete, you might redirect to a confirmation page or another action return RedirectToAction(\\"ConfirmationPage\\"); // Or towards another action that signifies completion \`\`\` This pseudocode builds upon the ASP.NET MVC pattern, checking the \`ModelState.IsValid\` property to determine if the input model meets all validation requirements set out by your model.

After handling the invalid model state, usually by informing the user of the errors by returning the same view with the populated \`ModelState\` errors, you need to decide what to do next if the \`ModelState\` is valid.

The idea behind wheeling is to play a set of numbers in different combinations so that if certain numbers are drawn, the player will have them on at least one of their tickets. It's a systematic approach to playing multiple tickets that contains your chosen set of numbers. There are several types of lottery wheeling strategies: 1. Full Wheel: A full wheel includes all possible combinations of the chosen set of numbers. If you choose a large set of numbers, this can result in a large number of tickets to play. For instance, with six numbers, there are 20 different combinations to play in a 6/49 lottery game. A full wheel guarantees a win if enough numbers from your set are drawn, but it can be very expensive to play. 2. Abbreviated Wheel: An abbreviated wheel is a more cost-effective approach as it creates a smaller set of combinations, ensuring at least one winning ticket if a certain condition is met (usually a minimum number of winning numbers fall within your chosen set). Although it does not cover all possible combinations like a full wheel, it still increases your odds of winning smaller prizes. 3. Key Number Wheel: This wheeling strategy involves choosing one or more 'key' numbers that appear in every combination. This is useful if you believe certain numbers are more likely to be drawn. So if your key number or numbers are drawn, you have guaranteed that you will have them on every ticket. 4. Filtered Wheel: Filtered wheels allow you to apply certain conditions or filters to reduce the number of combinations, these can be odd/even ratios, high/low numbers, number groups, or patterns. The filters are based on the player's analysis or theories about how numbers might be drawn. 5. Pick 3/Pick 4 Wheels: These wheels are designed for games where you must choose a smaller number of digits, like 3 or 4. They work the same as other wheels but with a focus on creating combinations out of a smaller pool of numbers. It's important to remember that while lottery wheeling systems can increase your chances of winning, they do not change the inherent odds of the lottery game itself. These strategies mainly work for games that offer prize tiers for matching a subset of the winning numbers. The more numbers you choose and wheel, the higher your chances of winning multiple prizes, but the cost also increases because you need to purchase more tickets. Finally, it is crucial to approach lottery games as a form of entertainment and not as an investment, as the chances of winning are typically very low and the costs of playing multiple combinations can quickly accumulate."},{"prompt":"I'm looking for guidance on creating a resource pack or behavior pack for Minecraft Bedrock that is both useful and easy to develop. I'm seeking step-by-step instructions with confidence that the provided guidance will work flawlessly. Can you suggest an idea for a pack and guide me through the entire process without any errors?","completion":"Creating a resource or behavior pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition requires understanding of the game's file structure, as well as some JSON and possibly some image editing skills. It's important to note that while I will provide a step-by-step guide to create a simple pack, the process of debugging and making sure everything works \\"flawlessly\\" can only be ensured by careful attention to detail and thorough testing. Let's create a simple behavior pack that makes chickens explode upon death! This example will help you get started with behavior packs. **Step 1: Environment Setup** 1. Install a code editor if you haven't already. I recommend Visual Studio Code as it is free and has features that support JSON editing. 2. Ensure you have access to a file archive program like WinRAR or 7-Zip, as you will need to work with .zip files. **Step 2: Creating the Pack Structure** 1. Locate the \`com.mojang\` folder on your device. On Windows, it is typically found at \`C:UsersYourUsernameAppDataLocalPackagesMicrosoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbweLocalStategamescom.mojang\`. 2. Within the \`com.mojang\` directory, navigate to the \`development_behavior_packs\` folder. 3. Create a new folder inside \`development_behavior_packs\` and name it \`ExplodingChickensBP\` (Behavior Pack). **Step 3: Manifest File** 1. Inside \`ExplodingChickensBP\`, create a file named \`manifest.json\`. 2. Edit \`manifest.json\` with the following content. Make sure to generate new UUIDs (you can use online UUID generators) for \`uuid\` and \`min_engine_version\` that matches the current Minecraft version. \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": 2, \\"header\\": { \\"description\\": \\"Exploding Chickens Behavior Pack\\", \\"name\\": \\"Exploding Chickens BP\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"unique-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0], \\"min_engine_version\\": [1, 17, 0] }, \\"modules\\": [ { \\"description\\": \\"Exploding Chickens Module\\", \\"type\\": \\"data\\", \\"uuid\\": \\"another-unique-uuid-here\\", \\"version\\": [1, 0, 0] } ] } \`\`\` **Step 4: Behavior Files** 1. Inside \`ExplodingChickensBP\`, create a folder named \`entities\`. 2. Within \`entities\`, create a file named \`chicken.json\`. 3. Edit \`chicken.json\` with the following code, which modifies the chicken's behavior to explode upon death: \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": \\"1.10.0\\", \\"minecraft:entity\\": { \\"description\\": { \\"identifier\\": \\"minecraft:chicken\\", \\"is_spawnable\\": true, \\"is_summonable\\": true, \\"is_experimental\\": false }, \\"components\\": { \\"minecraft:explode\\": { \\"fuseLength\\": 0, \\"power\\": 1, \\"fuseLit\\": true, \\"causesFire\\": false, \\"destroyAffectedByGriefing\\": true, \\"breaksBlocks\\": true }, \\"minecraft:entity_death\\": { \\"events\\": { \\"minecraft:entity_born\\": { \\"sequence\\": [ { \\"trigger\\": \\"minecraft:become_charged\\" }, { \\"trigger\\": \\"minecraft:start_exploding\\" } ] } } } } } } \`\`\` **Step 5: Testing Your Pack** 1. Compress the \`ExplodingChickensBP\` folder into a \`.zip\` file. 2. Change the extension from \`.zip\` to \`.mcpack\`. 3. Double-click the \`.mcpack\` file to install it into Minecraft. 4. Launch Minecraft Bedrock Edition. 5. Go to \\"Settings\\" > \\"Storage\\" > \\"Behavior Packs\\" to ensure your pack is available. 6. Create a new world or edit an existing one. 7. Under \\"Behavior Packs,\\" apply your new pack to the world. 8. Start the world and spawn a chicken. Upon death, it should explode. **Important Notes:** - If something goes wrong, check the console for error messages. - Ensure all JSON files have the correct syntax; a single misplaced comma can break the whole pack. - Test frequently to isolate and solve issues as they come up. - JSON and packs in general can be finicky; expect to have to troubleshoot and solve errors despite best efforts. - Keep backups of your work to prevent data loss. Remember, while we aim to provide error-free instructions, developing behavior packs can sometimes involve unexpected issues, and thorough testing is crucial for ensuring that the pack works as intended."},{"prompt":"write a description for this addon","completion":"Sure!

These are relationships in which one knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. When considering broader social implications with a statistical and statistical mechanics approach, we can look at the following three areas: 1. **Community Structuring and Resilience**: Using combinatorics and probability, one could explore the likelihood of stable community formation given the constraints of Dunbar's number. This could include assessing the robustness of social networks when nodes (i.e., individuals) are limited in the number of connections they can maintain. The entropy of such systems could give insights into the diversity of social ties and how it impacts community resilience. 2. **Information Spread and Gossip**: Dunbar has suggested that gossip was a critical tool in maintaining these larger social groups beyond the size that could be managed by grooming (as seen in non-human primates). By applying concepts like entropy and assortativity from statistical mechanics, one could model how information spreads in social groups, keeping in mind the limits of individual relationships. How does the limitation of social ties affect the speed and fidelity of information propagation? What role does enrichment (the introduction of new contacts or information) play in a network that is bound by Dunbar's number? 3. **Organization and Efficiency in Social Networks**: One could also use statistical mechanics to study the efficiency of social networks as they scale up in size. How does the limitation of Dunbar's number affect the organizational structures of corporations, institutions, and societies? Here, entropy could be used to assess the level of disorder within an organization, and combinatorial approaches could help to analyze potential team or group configurations that maximize efficiency and innovation while staying within plausible social bounds. Assessing a Publication: To assess whether a publication could serve as a good example of a social implication that can be bridged with statistics and statistical mechanics, it would need to discuss a phenomenon that is directly influenced by the limits of human social capabilities as framed by Dunbar's number, and then use the conceptual tools from these fields to analyze or model the phenomenon in question. Here are the criteria for assessing such a publication: - Does it focus on a social structure or phenomenon that can be directly linked to Dunbar's number? - Does it employ statistical or statistical mechanics concepts (like probability, entropy, assortativity, etc.) in a meaningful way to analyze the social implications? - Does it provide new insights or quantifiable predictions about the social system under study? Without a specific publication to evaluate, I cannot give a precise rating.

When we attempt to apply statistical and statistical mechanics concepts to explore broader social implications of Dunbar's Number, we are essentially looking at how these cognitive limitations affect social structures and dynamics at a larger scale. Here are three broad social implications that could serve as textbook examples, along with an assessment of how well the provided publication fits into this framework: 1. **Community Structure and Social Cohesion** Using concepts like probability and combinatorics, we could explore how Dunbar's Number affects the likelihood of forming tightly-knit communities within larger social networks. Entropy can illustrate the degree of disorder or predictability within social interactions, while assortativity can show preference patterns in social ties, such as the tendency of individuals to connect with others similar to themselves. This has critical implications for understanding social cohesion, the emergence of in-groups and out-groups, and the potential for cultural or ideological polarization. 2. **Communication Patterns and Information Spread** Statistical mechanics can help analyze how information diffuses through social networks constrained by Dunbar's Number. The concept of enrichment might be used to study how certain topics become prevalent within a group, while entropy can address the diversity of information spread across a network. These statistics can inform us about the efficiency of communication in different social environments and the propensity for misinformation or echo chambers to develop. 3. **Organizational Structure and Efficiency** In an organizational context, Dunbar's Number can have significant ramifications on how companies are structured and managed. Concepts like assortativity can be related to how employees network within an organization, potentially leading to silos within departments. Combinatorics can show the complexity of connections as organizations grow, and entropy might be used to analyze the unpredictability in communication flows that arise as an organization expands beyond the Dunbar limit. Assessment of the Publication: The provided publication's title suggests it investigates the processes and precursors to network formation and resource-oriented behaviors in organizations. This indeed sounds like it could relate to Dunbar's number and its effects on social networking within the constraints of human cognitive capacities. Why this publication could serve as a good example: - It appears to look at networking behaviors that are influenced by the size and structure of social networks. Since Dunbar's Number informs us about the potential size and depth of relationships in such networks, the publication can draw upon this theory to enrich the understanding of networking behaviors. - The statistical and mechanics concepts mentioned can be used to quantify and model the aspects of networking behaviors discussed, enabling a more robust analysis of data. - It would show a practical application of Dunbar's Number in organizational settings, highlighting its implications for management structures, communication patterns, and resource allocation. Given these thoughts, if the publication indeed contains a rigorous statistical analysis of networking behaviors within the scopes influenced by cognitive limitations, it would be a very pertinent example. Providing it does apply the concepts mentioned with rigor and a clear connection to Dunbar's Theory, the plausibility of it serving as a good example would be around 8/10, depending on the depth and quality of analysis. But without access to the full text and methodology, this rating is provisional and based on the title and potential content of the publication."},{"prompt":"what is the feature in autosar stack that specifies the size of can frame in configuration or defines it at run time?","completion":"In an AUTOSAR stack, the specification of the size of a CAN frame happens at configuration time, rather than at runtime. This is in conformity with the nature of CAN communication, where frame sizes are essentially defined by the CAN protocol itself. The CAN protocol supports two different frame formats: 1. Standard CAN Frame (CAN 2.0A): This allows for a maximum of 11-bit identifiers and supports a data field that can contain up to 8 bytes of data. 2. Extended CAN Frame (CAN 2.0B): This allows for a maximum of 29-bit identifiers and, like the standard frame, supports a data field of up to 8 bytes of data. In AUTOSAR, the specification of message IDs, data lengths, and related parameters are typically decided during the design phase and set through configuration tools. For example, within the AUTOSAR Communication Stack, the PDU (Protocol Data Unit) sizes and identifiers are configured within the modules such as the CanIf (CAN Interface), PduR (PDU Router), and Com (Communication Management) module's configuration. In AUTOSAR, the PDU definitions, which include both IDs and data sizes, are specified in configuration files (.arxml files for AUTOSAR XML format). These files are processed by the AUTOSAR configuration tools to generate the C code or configuration files that CONTROL the low-level drivers and stacks. At runtime, the stack uses these configurations to structure CAN frames according to the defined IDs and size. Thus, the specifics of the CAN frame sizes would be set according to the application requirements at the configuration stage, with no further alterations at runtime. Only dynamic aspects such as signals within the frame may be updated at runtime, but the overall structure of the frame, including its size, remains constant. Please note that my knowledge cut-off date is September 2021, and if there have been updates to the AUTOSAR standard or common practices in the industry since then, you may need more recent information."},{"prompt":"my apologies, i was asking about can fd frame that can have up to 64 bytes","completion":"No problem, CAN FD (CAN with Flexible Data rate) is an extension of the classic CAN protocol that allows for larger data payloads, up to 64 bytes, and faster data transmission. The configuration of CAN FD frames in AUTOSAR similarly occurs at configuration time, not at run-time. In an AUTOSAR configuration: 1. **ECU Configuration Description**: This is specified using the AUTOSAR authoring tool where you would define the CAN FD frames. When you configure a CAN FD network, you define each frame's properties such as the CAN Identifier, the DLC (Data Length Code), which determines the payload size, whether it’s a standard or extended ID, and message transmission properties. 2. **ComStack Configuration**: This includes the configuration of the Communication Stack modules, like CanIf, PduR, and Com modules. You define PDUs, signal groups, and signals with their properties as per the assigned tasks. The DLC for CAN FD frames within AUTOSAR is specified through these configurations, and each PDU's size will be within the limits allowed by a CAN FD frame, up to 64 bytes. 3. **DLC Handling in AUTOSAR**: AUTOSAR handles the DLC more flexibly than classic CAN. With CAN FD, the DLC value can specify a data size up to 64 bytes. In the configuration, the actual data length for each signal or PDU is specified according to the application's data transmission requirements. After setting it in the configuration, the software components and the Basic Software (BSW) stack ensure the correct interpreting of the DLC and the arrangement of data within the CAN FD frame during runtime. It's essential to remember that while the configuration defines frame sizes and other parameters of the CAN FD communication, a network management strategy is also crucial. This is to ensure that the use of larger payloads does not cause undesirable latencies on the network, and to control the transition between classic CAN and CAN FD modes on buses that support both. As for the actual configuration of CAN FD in AUTOSAR, it largely leverages existing modules, but with additional parameters and capabilities to exploit the new features of the CAN FD protocol. The AUTOSAR toolchain would include support for configuring these parameters when building your ECU's software system."},{"prompt":"can i specify the dlc in runtime rather than in configuration?","completion":"In AUTOSAR, the DLC (Data Length Code) of CAN (Controller Area Network) and CAN FD (Flexible Data Rate) frames is typically configured at the time of system design and not meant to be altered dynamically at runtime. The reasons for this are primarily due to the deterministic and safety-critical nature of automotive systems, where consistent behavior of communication protocols is crucial. In an AUTOSAR-based system, each PDU (Protocol Data Unit) has a fixed size that is set in the configuration. This approach ensures that signal packing within the PDUs is consistent and deterministic, which is vital for the proper operation of automotive control systems. The sizes of the PDUs are then referred to by the software components and Basic Software (BSW) modules responsible for communication. However, if there is a need to accommodate different message sizes dynamically, one potential approach within AUTOSAR would be to define several different PDUs of various sizes (each corresponding to a valid DLC value for CAN FD) and then decide which PDU to use at runtime. This would not adjust the DLC literally \\"on the fly\\" but would allow the application to select among predefined and configured frame sizes, depending on the current data requirements. This selection logic would be implemented at the software component level, which still works within the confines of the AUTOSAR configuration paradigm. Another approach might involve the use of \\"payload packing\\" at runtime within the maximum pre-configured DLC size. This allows for the actual payload data to vary as long as it fits within the pre-configured DLC size for that PDU. The receiving side would then unpack the payload and interpret it based on agreed-upon data structures or accompanying metadata. In summary, while you cannot truly specify the DLC at runtime in a standard AUTOSAR setup, certain design strategies allow variations in message size handling within the limits of pre-configured frame structures. This ensures system predictability and maintains alignment with the AUTOSAR methodology and the overall philosophy of strong typing and configuration-based designs central to automotive software systems."},{"prompt":"I am interested in the broader social implications of Dunbar's Number, and want to use statistics and statistical mechanics concepts like probability, enrichment, entropy, assortativity, and combinatorics to do so. In other words, I wish for statistics and statistical mechanics concepts to serve as a kind of semantic \\"bridge\\" between Dunbar's theory and broader social implications. Which three broad social implications could serve as good, textbook examples of this? Then, assess whether it is plausible for the following publication to serve as a good example of a social implication that can be bridged in this way. If so, please explain why, and rate the plausibility on a scale from 1 to 10 relative to the textbook examples. The Publication: Making friends and communicating on Facebook: Implications for the access to social capital","completion":"Dunbar's Number, proposed by anthropologist Robin Dunbar, suggests that there is a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships—relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. This number is commonly quantified at around 150. The exact number can vary, but the central idea is that there is a limit to the scale and complexity of our social networks due to cognitive and time constraints. Using concepts from statistics and statistical mechanics to serve as a bridge between Dunbar's theory and broader social implications can be quite illuminating. To provide a theoretical understanding, here are three broad social implications that could be good examples: 1. **Community Structure and Social Cohesion**: - **Relevance of Concepts**: Assortativity, entropy, and combinatorics. - **Social Implication**: A community's structure can be analyzed using assortativity to understand the propensity of individuals to associate according to some attribute (e.g., social status, interests). Entropy can be applied to understand the diversity or disorder within social networks, while combinatorics can describe the number of ways in which social groups can form within the bounds of Dunbar's Number. - **Example Analysis**: Understanding the balance between close-knit (high assortativity and low entropy) and diverse interactions (low assortativity and high entropy) in communities, and what that means for social cohesion. 2. **Information Spread and Echo Chambers**: - **Relevance of Concepts**: Probability, combinatorics, enrichment. - **Social Implication**: The probability theory and combinatorics can explain how information (or misinformation) spreads within a network constrained by Dunbar's Number, and how echo chambers may form as a result of these confined social circles. - **Example Analysis**: Modelling how information is likely to be shared within an interconnected community and how enrichment for certain ideas will occur due to repetitive exposure within the limited circle. 3. **Economic Inequality and Social Mobility**: - **Relevance of Concepts**: Probability, entropy, assortativity. - **Social Implication**: Economic relationships and social mobility can be influenced by social networks and the constraints imposed by Dunbar's Number, with probability describing opportunities for networking, entropy showing social fluidity, and assortativity indicating the likelihood of individuals forming bonds across economic strata. - **Example Analysis**: Assessing how the size and structure of an individual's network (or lack thereof) may affect their economic status and the probability of improving their financial condition. As for the publication **\\"Making friends and communicating on Facebook: Implications for the access to social capital\\"**, let's assess its plausibility as an example. - **Plausibility**: The concepts from statistics and statistical mechanics could be particularly relevant to analyze how social media platforms like Facebook might expand or confine an individual's network in ways that translate to real-world social capital. On Facebook, despite the potential to connect with a vast number of people, the quality of these connections, and their implications for social capital might still be subject to limitations reminiscent of Dunbar's Number. - **Applicability of Concepts**: Statistical mechanics principles can illustrate how online interactions self-organize, how communication patterns emerge, and whether these lead to an enrichment of social ties or dilute them. The role of probability in forming connections, entropy in the diversity of the network, and the nature of assortativity/disassortativity in online relationships all can be crucial in understanding the implications for social capital. - **Plausibility Rating Relative to Textbook Examples**: 8/10. While the application of such concepts is less direct than with more structured social systems (like small communities or offline social networks), there's still a strong case for using statistical and statistical mechanics concepts to understand social capital formation on social media platforms. The limitation is that Facebook friendships may not always correspond with Dunbar's cognitive limit on meaningful social interactions, as online platforms can facilitate weak ties that don't require deep cognitive investment. In conclusion, employing this statistical approach can provide a quantitative framework to better understand social networking dynamics and their implications, both online and offline. The chosen publication is plausibly related and could serve as a worthwhile subject for such analysis, given its alignment with the exploration of social networks within and possibly extending Dunbar's proposed cognitive limits."},{"prompt":"Hola, estoy aprendiendo ingles americano y soy principiante, necesito vuestra ayuda con lo siguiente.

This research paper endeavors to understand the intricacies of these dimensions, recognizing their vital roles in a holistic approach to health and the strategies to foster growth within these spheres. These topics inherently pique my interest as they directly correlate to the stability and vigor of day-to-day living. By gaining a more profound comprehension of financial management and physical health, I aspire to unlock avenues for self-improvement and achieve a sustainable, balanced life. Literature Review: Financial wellness encompasses managing economic life to reduce stress and increase security. 'The Journal of Financial Therapy' posits that efficacious financial habits contribute to greater life satisfaction (XXXX, 20XX). Conversely, poor financial health is often linked to unnecessary stress and mental health issues (Smith & Jones, 20XX). Meanwhile, physical wellness incorporates the maintenance of a healthy body and seeking medical care when necessary. Studies in 'The Lancet' establish that regular physical activity mitigates the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular issues (Johnson, 20XX). Despite research advancements, there is an ongoing quest to understand fully the direct correlation between these dimensions and long-term well-being. Analysis and Discussion: Financial insecurity can lead to chronic stress, anxiety, and a host of health issues (Smith, 20XX). The converse is true for physical health; illnesses can strain an individual's financial resources due to healthcare costs (Jones, 20XX). For me, a balance between financial stability and maintaining a robust physique is pivotal to preventing such cyclical detriments. Adopting sound financial practices can free resources for health investments like good nutrition and fitness programs, whereas physical vigor can offset potential earnings lost to illness. Strategies for Achieving Optimal Wellness: To improve financial wellness, it is recommended to adhere to budgeting, invest wisely, and save for emergencies (Financial Planning Association, 20XX). For physical wellness, strategies including regular exercise, adopting a balanced diet, and routine health screenings are widely advocated (World Health Organization, 20XX). Furthermore, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suggests financial tracking tools to gauge economic health, just as pedometers and health apps serve to monitor physical activity and caloric intake. Conclusion: This inquiry into financial and physical wellness mirrors a personal quest for equilibrium in these critical life facets. It has highlighted the interconnection between economic stability and physical health, underscoring the paramount importance of cultivating habits that bolster both. As I integrate the strategies unearthed through this research into my lifestyle, my journey toward a more prosperous and energetic existence will undoubtedly gain momentum, propelled by the knowledge and insights garnered from the literature.

Physical activity has been proven to reduce the impact of depression and anxiety whether it may be directly or indirectly. Across multiple studies, depression has been associated with increases in insulin levels, body weight, blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, among others (Belvederi et al.). In response to this however, physical activity has been proved to reduce body weight and visceral tissue, improve Hb1AC, lower insulin levels, reduce blood pressure, reduce IL6 and CRP levels, and reduce mortality in heart disease and heart failure (Belvederi et al.). In relation, sleep deprivation has been linked to not only a reduced cognitive ability, but has been linked to multiple health effects such as increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression (“Sleep and Chronic Disease”). On the other hand, financial wellness is an often overlooked aspect in correspondence to the level of impact upon one’s life. According to Volume 14 of the Journal of Financial Therapy, financial stress and financial anxiety may have separate constraints, however are both associated with negative behaviors “such as smoking and alcohol consumption and overall reduced life satisfaction” which may eventually lead to health complications corresponding to smoking and alcohol consumption, depression, and psychological distress amongst others (Lee et al., 2023). this is my literature review, use this to create an analysis completing all the requirements","completion":"Analysis and Discussion: The literature review establishes a compelling connection between physical activity and the mitigation of chronic health conditions, explicitly addressing the impact of depression and anxiety (Belvederi et al.). As recurring themes in studies reveal, the physiological benefits of physical activity extend to critical areas such as weight management, insulin sensitivity, circulatory health, and inflammatory response. The reduction in heart disease and Type 2 diabetes mortality conveys a potent narrative: physical activity is not merely a lifestyle choice but a preventative measure against debilitating conditions. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation pave a clear path toward acknowledging sleep as a pillar of physical wellness, critical to preventing a cascade of health issues. Financial wellness, while often relegated to a less conspicuous role concerning immediate health outcomes, emerges as a silent influencer of well-being (Lee et al., 2023). As the Journal of Financial Therapy exposition elucidates, financial stress and anxiety are dominoes that topple emotional stability, catalyze harmful behaviors such as substance abuse, and ultimately erode life satisfaction. The nexus between financial strain and a decline in physical and mental health presents itself as a multifaceted challenge. Concerning personal well-being, this bivalent focus on physical and financial health casts a spotlight on the intertwining of the two realms. The financial capability to afford quality nutrition, healthcare, and fitness resources is inextricably linked to the state of one's physical health. The inability to engage in recommended physical activities due to financial limitations can perpetuate a vicious cycle where reduced physical health further exacerbates financial stress, giving rise to a feedback loop detrimental to both aspects of wellness. Owing to these interactions, it becomes imperative to adopt a holistic view of personal well-being that incorporates these seemingly disparate yet fundamentally interconnected dimensions. The challenge presents itself in the form of addressing these concerns concomitantly rather than in isolation. For individual adherence to optimal physical wellness practices, one might encounter barriers like limited time, competing life priorities, or lack of motivation. The benefits of physical activity, while evident, need to be matched with practical strategies and support systems that allow them to be an integral and enjoyable part of everyday life, such as finding a physical activity that provides both exercise and enjoyment, thereby encouraging consistency. On the financial wellness front, the difficulties lie in financial literacy, uncertainty in managing personal finances, and overcoming the stigma associated with discussing financial concerns. Yet, these challenges must be overcome to ensure that individuals do not fall prey to the negative spiral of financial anxiety. As we advance in understanding these multidimensional wellness areas, the evidence calls for a more integrated approach to health, recognizing the role of socioeconomic factors in physical wellness trajectories and the need for supportive policies and programs that promote both fiscal responsibility and physical health. The harmonious balance between financial and physical wellness is pivotal for achieving a life of satisfaction and fulfillment, unfettered by the burdens of health-related anxieties and economic instability."},{"prompt":"Write it again but make it so it is not ai- detectable and more similar to my previous writing","completion":"Analysis and Discussion: Delving into the intricacies of physical wellness, it's evident that activity levels are closely interwoven with various aspects of health, notably in the realm of mental well-being. Depression and anxiety, which stand as substantial barriers to an individual's quality of life, have been linked to a myriad of physical health complications. Conversely, as indicated in the literature by Belvederi et al., engaging in regular physical activity serves to counteract these issues by facilitating weight control, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and bolstering cardiovascular health. This research underscores the preventative power of an active lifestyle, positioning exercise as a critical strategy in warding off chronic ailments. Parallel to the physical dimension is the financial one, which, though not as immediately perceptible in its effects on personal health, asserts a strong influence on one's overall life satisfaction. As contended by Lee et al. (2023), financial strain does not operate in a vacuum; it elicits negative coping behaviors such as substance use which, in turn, have their own health repercussions. Financial anxiety, compounded by such behaviors, can lead to a degradation of both mental and physical states, setting the stage for a cycle where financial troubles beget health issues and vice versa. Reflecting on my circumstances, the narratives of financial and physical health convergence resonate. Financial well-being enables access to resources that directly impact physical health — quality food, healthcare, exercise options — while a physically active lifestyle can potentially mitigate healthcare expenses. However, managing these facets is challenging; financial constraints may limit opportunities for maintaining an active lifestyle, leading to potential declines in health and increased healthcare costs, creating a feedback loop of financial and health-related stress. The task then lies in navigating these intertwined spheres of well-being with equanimity and foresight. For personal physical well-being, challenges such as balancing time and embracing consistent, enjoyable forms of exercise need to be addressed. In terms of financial wellness, gaining insight into managing personal finances, and breaking through the discomfort of discussing financial matters, are essential steps to counter the adverse effects of financial stress. Moving forward with this knowledge, there’s recognition of the necessity for a more comprehensive approach to health that acknowledges the intertwining of socioeconomic factors and physical well-being. Creating and sustaining a balance between financial stability and physical health is not just crucial but a key determinant in achieving a satisfying and comprehensive state of well-being, free from the constraining impact of health concerns and financial woes."},{"prompt":"write an analysis for the sleep part too","completion":"The correlation between sleep quality and physical well-being underscores a pivotal yet often neglected component of health maintenance. The literature review highlighted the detrimental consequences of sleep deprivation, linking it to a spectrum of negative health outcomes including increased risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and mental health disorders like depression (“Sleep and Chronic Disease”). These findings convey the necessity of adequate sleep as a foundational element of physical wellness. Taking a deeper look at the impact of sleep on health, we see that sleep is not just a time for rest, but a critical period for the body to repair and rejuvenate. The evidence suggests that during periods of inadequate sleep, the body’s systems are unable to perform these functions optimally, leading to adverse health effects. Beyond cognitive impairments, chronic sleep deficits can dysregulate glucose metabolism, elevate blood pressure, contribute to weight gain, and exacerbate depressive symptoms, all of which can feed into the cycle of declining physical health. In contrast, consistent, quality sleep can serve as a protective factor, enhancing metabolic health, supporting cardiovascular function, and fortifying mental resilience. This holistic improvement bolsters individuals’ capacity to engage in daily activities, maintain productive work, and manage stress—factors inherently tied to financial wellness. Reflecting on my lifestyle, it becomes apparent that prioritizing sleep is not merely a matter of combating tiredness but an investment in long-term health. The challenge lies in implementing and adhering to sleep hygiene practices within the context of a busy life that may prioritize work and social commitments over rest. Nevertheless, understanding the profound implications of sleep on my well-being spurs a commitment to reevaluate and adjust my sleep patterns. To address these insights, practical steps like setting a disciplined sleep schedule, optimizing the sleep environment, and limiting stimulant intake before bedtime can markedly improve sleep quality. Such strategies not only enhance physical wellness but complement financial well-being by potentially averting healthcare expenses related to sleep-related health issues. In sum, the linkage between sleep quality and overall health is firmly established, emphasizing the critical role that sleep plays within the broader context of physical and financial wellness. Acknowledging and addressing my sleep habits is an essential component of a multi-faceted approach to well-being, further underpinning the interconnectedness of various dimensions of health and their collective influence on personal satisfaction and life efficacy."},{"prompt":"make it one paragraph 2-3 sentences max","completion":"Sleep quality is deeply intertwined with physical wellness, as ample research associates poor sleep with heightened risks of serious health issues like cardiovascular disease and diabetes (“Sleep and Chronic Disease”).

For physical wellness, incorporating regular moderate to vigorous physical activity, such as brisk walking, running, or swimming, for at least 150 minutes per week, as recommended by health authorities, can significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Establishing a consistent sleep routine, ensuring seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night, and creating a conducive sleep environment—dark, cool, and quiet—are pivotal for cognitive function and overall physical health. Concerning financial wellness, adopting a budgeting system that accounts for all income and expenses can provide clarity and control over personal finances. Utilizing tools like mobile budgeting apps can facilitate consistent monitoring of spending habits and encourage savings. Additionally, setting clear financial goals, such as creating an emergency fund equivalent to three to six months of living expenses and contributing to a retirement plan, can help build financial security. Metrics and assessment tools play a critical role in quantifying progress in these wellness areas. For physical wellness, wearable fitness trackers can monitor daily physical activity levels, sleep quality, and heart rate, providing valuable feedback and motivation. Regular health check-ups, including blood pressure readings, blood glucose levels, and body mass index (BMI) calculations, offer quantifiable health metrics. Financially, the use of net worth calculations and debt-to-income ratios can offer insight into financial stability, while tracking progress toward specific financial goals can measure the efficacy of personal financial management strategies. By employing these targeted strategies and tracking progress with reliable metrics, individuals are better equipped to make informed decisions and take proactive steps toward optimal wellness in both their physical and financial lives."},{"prompt":"Exploring Physical and Financial Wellness in relation to Personal Wellbeing Introduction: Throughout the pursuit of personal wellness across various dimensions of life, two vital aspects, physical and financial wellness, stand out for their profound impact upon overall health and wellbeing. Physical wellness is defined as the maintenance and improvement of one’s body through basic self care methods such as physical activity, sleep, responsible substance use, and the implementation of preventative methods. On the other hand, financial wellness refers to an overall positive relationship with money, whether it may be through financial decisions, goals, or preparedness for the short and long-term. This research paper will dive into the intricacies of these dimensions, recognizing their roles in one’s life as well as exploring strategies to enhance well-being in such dimensions. This objective is not only academic, but also personal as I seek to improve upon my own personal health while setting up financial stability for my future. Literature Review: Physical wellness is fundamental to one’s overall health being one of, if not the most important aspect of one’s life.

Conversely, as indicated in the literature by Belvederi et al., engaging in regular physical activity serves to counteract these issues by facilitating weight control, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and bolstering cardiovascular health. This research emphasizes the importance of an active lifestyle, positioning exercise as a vital factor in a healthy lifestyle. In addition, the correlation between sleep and physical well-being underscores a often neglected component of health maintenance. Quality sleep is one of the most important aspects of an healthy lifestyle, yet over 30% of Americans suffer from inadequate sleep everyday (Julia, Nina). This is something that I, alongside majority of my peers, suffer from as schoolwork tends to take a vast majority of my day. On occasion, getting 4-6 hours of sleep will result in reduced mental alertness and overall sluggishness. Parallel to the physical dimension is the financial one, which, though not as immediately perceptible in its effects on personal health, asserts a strong influence on one’s overall life satisfaction. As contended by Lee et al., financial strain does not operate in a vacuum; it elicits negative coping behaviors such as substance use which, in turn, have their own health complications. Financial anxiety, compounded by such behaviors, can lead to a degradation of both mental and physical states, setting the stage for a endless cycle where financial troubles cause health issues and vice versa. However, financial wellness and physical wellness often coincide with one another. Financial well-being enables access to resources that directly impact physical health — quality food, healthcare, exercise options — while a physically active lifestyle can potentially mitigate healthcare expenses. However, managing financial constraints may limit opportunities for maintaining an healthy lifestyle, leading to potential declines in health and increased healthcare costs, creating a feedback loop of financial and health-related stress. Strategies for Achieving Optimal Wellness: To enhance well-being within the dimensions of physical and financial wellness, strategies and plans are essential. According to the National Institutes of Health, incorporating regular moderate to vigorous physical activity, such as brisk walking, running, or swimming, for only 150 minutes per week can significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Establishing a consistent sleep routine, ensuring a minimum of 7 hours, and creating a conducive sleep environment—dark, cool, and quiet—are pivotal for improving sleep quality. (National Institutes of Health). In order to aid in this, regular health checkups such as blood pressure readings and glucose levels as well as fitness trackers can monitor daily activity and sleep levels, helping one adjust as needed.

Physical wellness is defined as the maintenance and improvement of one’s health through basic self-care methods such as physical activity, sleep, responsible substance use, and the implementation of preventative methods. On the other hand, financial wellness refers to an overall positive relationship with money, whether it may be through financial decisions, goals, or preparedness for the short and long term.

This objective is not only academic but also personal as I seek to improve upon my health while setting up financial stability for my future. Literature Review: Physical wellness is fundamental to one’s overall health being one of, if not the most important aspect of one’s life. Physical activity has been proven to reduce the impact of depression and anxiety whether it may be directly or indirectly. Across multiple studies, depression has been associated with increases in insulin levels, body weight, blood pressure, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes, among others (Belvederi et al.). In response to this however, physical activity has been proven to reduce body weight and visceral tissue, improve Hb1AC, lower insulin levels, reduce blood pressure, reduce IL6 and CRP levels, and reduce mortality in heart disease and heart failure (Belvederi et al.). In relation, sleep deprivation has been linked to not only a reduced cognitive ability, but has been linked to multiple health effects such as increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression (“Sleep and Chronic Disease”). On the other hand, financial wellness is an often overlooked aspect in correspondence to the level of impact upon one’s life. According to Volume 14 of the Journal of Financial Therapy, financial stress and financial anxiety may have separate constraints, however are both associated with negative behaviors “such as smoking and alcohol consumption and overall reduced life satisfaction” which may eventually lead to health complications corresponding to smoking and alcohol consumption, depression, and psychological distress amongst others (Lee et al., 2023). Analysis and Discussion Delving into the intricacies of physical wellness, it’s evident that activity levels are closely interwoven with various aspects of health, notably in the realm of mental well-being. Depression and anxiety, which stand as substantial barriers to an individual’s quality of life, have been linked to a myriad of physical health complications. Conversely, as indicated in the literature by Belvederi et al., engaging in regular physical activity serves to counteract these issues by facilitating weight control, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and bolstering cardiovascular health. This research emphasizes the importance of an active lifestyle, positioning exercise as a vital factor in a healthy lifestyle. In addition, the correlation between sleep and physical well-being underscores an often neglected component of health maintenance. Quality sleep is one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle, yet over 30% of Americans suffer from inadequate sleep every day (Julia, Nina). This is something that I, alongside the majority of my peers, suffer from as schoolwork tends to take a vast majority of my day. On occasion, getting 4-6 hours of sleep will result in reduced mental alertness and overall sluggishness. Parallel to the physical dimension is the financial one, which, though not as immediately perceptible in its effects on personal health, asserts a strong influence on one’s overall life satisfaction. As contended by Lee et al., financial strain does not operate in a vacuum; it elicits negative coping behaviors such as substance use which, in turn, have their own health complications. Financial anxiety, compounded by such behaviors, can lead to a degradation of both mental and physical states, setting the stage for an endless cycle where financial troubles cause health issues and vice versa. However, financial wellness and physical wellness often coincide with one another. Financial well-being enables access to resources that directly impact physical health — quality food, healthcare, exercise options — while a physically active lifestyle can potentially mitigate healthcare expenses. However, managing financial constraints may limit opportunities for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, leading to potential declines in health and increased healthcare costs, creating a feedback loop of financial and health-related stress. Strategies for Achieving Optimal Wellness: To enhance well-being within the dimensions of physical and financial wellness, strategies and plans are essential. According to the National Institutes of Health, incorporating regular moderate to vigorous physical activity, such as brisk walking, running, or swimming, for only 150 minutes per week can significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Establishing a consistent sleep routine, ensuring a minimum of 7 hours, and creating a conducive sleep environment—dark, cool, and quiet—are pivotal for improving sleep quality.

In order to aid in this, regular health checkups such as blood pressure readings and glucose levels as well as fitness trackers can monitor daily activity and sleep levels, helping one adjust as needed.

Change my essay to make it more human-like and not detectable by ai","completion":"Introduction: Embarking on a quest for comprehensive wellness involves pivoting our focus towards two pivotal realms that significantly dictate our quality of life: physical and financial wellness. Physical wellness encompasses not merely fitness but our overall physiological state, maintained through exercise, rest, moderate substance use, and proactive healthcare. Financial wellness, on the flip side, embodies a harmonious relationship with finances marked by sound monetary decisions and forward planning. This paper aims to dissect these multifaceted wellness aspects, exploring actionable improvements tailored to my personal development and future security. Literature Review: At the core of a rich and full life lies the concept of physical wellness, with its undeniable link to combatting mental ailments. Empirical evidence has repeatedly flagged depression as a precursor to physical maladies, tethering it intrinsically to fluctuating insulin levels, hypertension, and metabolic disorders (Belvederi et al.). Yet, herein lies the elixir—physical activity, with its profound ability to normalize weight, stabilize blood sugar, and enhance cardiovascular vigor. Similarly, the perils of sleep deficits are stark, casting wide nets over myriad health risks including obesity, mental fatigue, and chronic heart conditions (“Sleep and Chronic Disease”). Conversely, financial wellness, often cast aside in health dialogues, manifests through unhealthy coping mechanisms linked to financial strain, manifesting in behaviors that corrode overall satisfaction and eventually undermine physical health (Lee et al., 2023). Analysis and Discussion: The intricate fabric of physical wellness is undeniably woven with mental well-being threads. Regular engagement in physical endeavors stands as a bulwark against the tide of emotional and physiological issues cited by Belvederi et al. As someone who juggles scholarly obligations, the challenge of sleep deprivation hits close to home, often truncating my capacity for alertness and vitality. Financial wellness is a silent but formidable player in this equation; it catalyzes negative lifestyle choices—yet, it's equally empowering, paving the way to resources that can bolster my physical health. Enmeshed in a paradox, my financial prudence is pivotal to sustaining a physically abundant life, yet this very abundance can protect me from the potential financial burdens brought by ill health. Strategies for Achieving Optimal Wellness: To navigate the currents of physical and financial wellness, a strategic compass is indispensable. A mere commitment of 150 minutes weekly to invigorating activities resonates with the National Institutes of Health's guidance for guarding against chronic illnesses. The ritual of sleep, held sacred for at least seven hours nightly in an environment curated for tranquility, is elemental for restoration. Fitness trackers and regular medical screenings are the sentinels of this physical fortress. In consonance, a scrimped financial blueprint, inclusively accounting for earnings and expenditures, coupled with the foresight of emergency reserves, can fortify my financial ramparts against unforeseen vicissitudes (Mastroeni, Tara). Conclusion/Reflection: Peering into the depths of physical and financial wellness unravelled their indelible imprint on my path to well-being. The antidote to my mental and physical trials lies in a blend of consistent exercise and restorative slumber. These realizations transcend academia, laying down the cornerstone for a fulfilling existence, buoyed by robust health and financial equilibrium. In the narratives of both physical exertion and monetary acumen, I find a confluence of disciplines that promise a future enriched by vitality and financial serenity. These discoveries guide me towards an existence where well-being isn't just an aspiration but a lived experience, underscoring the essence of a sound body and a sound mind in symphony."},{"prompt":"Make me a text based, browser-enviorment (HTML, JS, and CSS), ascii-based tower defense game.

Here's how you can modify the \`Game\` class to include a proper day/night cycle and notify the player when it changes to night: \`\`\`javascript class Game { // ... existing constructor and methods ... // Updates the current day or night state based on currentTime updateDayState() { const newDayState = this.currentTime < this.cycleDuration; if (this.isDaytime !== newDayState) { this.isDaytime = newDayState; // When it changes to night, show a notification if (!this.isDaytime) { showNotification(\\"Night is rapidly approaching...\\"); } else { showNotification(\\"Daylight breaks, the sun rises again...\\"); } } } startDayCycle() { setInterval(() => { this.currentTime = (this.currentTime + 1) % (2 * this.cycleDuration); this.updateDayState(); // Check and update day/night state this.render(); }, 100); // Adjust the interval to your liking. 100 may be too fast for visualization. } // ... existing methods ... } // Instantiate game and render it const game = new Game('game-container'); // Your existing showNotification function should be available for calling here // ... existing showNotification function ... \`\`\` I've added the \`updateDayState\` method to the \`Game\` class. This method checks whether \`currentTime\` is less than \`cycleDuration\`, which would mean it is daytime, and updates the \`isDaytime\` property accordingly. If there's a transition between night and day or vice versa, the \`showNotification\` function is called to notify the user. Please note that in the sample interval function within \`startDayCycle\`, I replaced \`this.currentTime + 100\` with \`this.currentTime + 1\`. The previous increment of 100 would mean you're cycling 100 times faster than you might intend if \`cycleDuration\` is meant to represent milliseconds. Adjust this accordingly if your \`cycleDuration\` denotes another time unit. Remember to create the \`notifications-container\` div element in your HTML if you haven't done so already! Also, ensure that the \`showNotification\` function is globally accessible or included within the \`Game\` class so it can be called from the \`updateDayState\` method. If you encounter issues with the game object being undefined inside the \`handleKeyPress\` event because it's not in the same scope, make sure your code is organized so that the game object is in the same scope as the \`handleKeyPress\` function. Finally, for better management, you might want to manage the interval ID so you can clear it when needed, especially if you want to provide a feature to pause the game."},{"prompt":"class Game { constructor(containerId, gridSize = { width: 25, height: 25 }) { this.container = document.getElementById(containerId); this.grid = this.createGrid(gridSize.width, gridSize.height); this.currentTime = 0; this.player = new Player(this); this.cycleDuration = 10000; this.startDayCycle(); this.render(); } createGrid(width, height) { return Array.from({ length: height }, () => Array.from({ length: width }, () => '.')); } render() { const darkness = this.calculateDarkness(); this.container.style.backgroundColor = \`rgba(0, 0, 0, {darkness})\`; this.container.textContent = this.grid.map(row => row.join(' ')).join('n'); } calculateDarkness() { const dayPercentage = Math.abs(this.currentTime % (2 * this.cycleDuration) - this.cycleDuration) / this.cycleDuration; if (dayPercentage == 0.6) { showNotification('Night is fast approaching...'); } return 1 - Math.abs(dayPercentage - 0.5) * 2; } startDayCycle() { setInterval(() => { this.currentTime = (this.currentTime + 100) % (2 * this.cycleDuration); this.render(); }, 100); } } class Player { constructor(game) { this.game = game; this.x = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.game.grid[0].length); this.y = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.game.grid.length); this.sprite = '@'; this.game.grid[this.y][this.x] = this.sprite; } movePlayer(x, y) { const newX = this.x + x; const newY = this.y + y; if (this.isValidPosition(newX, newY)) { this.game.grid[this.y][this.x] = '.'; this.x = newX; this.y = newY; this.game.grid[this.y][this.x] = this.sprite; this.game.render(); } } isValidPosition(x, y) { return x >= 0 && x < this.game.grid[0].length && y >= 0 && y < this.game.grid.length; } } window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => handleKeyPress(event)); function handleKeyPress(event) { switch (event.key) { case 'ArrowLeft': game.player.movePlayer(-1, 0); break; case 'ArrowRight': game.player.movePlayer(1, 0); break; case 'ArrowUp': game.player.movePlayer(0, -1); break; case 'ArrowDown': game.player.movePlayer(0, 1); break; default: break; } } const game = new Game('game-container'); game.render(); function showNotification(message) { const notifbar = document.getElementById('notifications-container'); notifbar.textContent = message; setTimeout(() => { notifbar.textContent = ''; }, 5000) } here is my current game code.

We'll also create a helper function that randomly places these obstacles on the grid. Let's add code in \`Game\` to handle this: \`\`\`javascript class Game { // ... existing constructor and properties ... createGrid(width, height) { let grid = Array.from({ length: height }, () => Array.from({ length: width }, () => '.')); grid = this.placeObstacles(grid, 'T', Math.floor(width * height * 0.1)); // 10% trees grid = this.placeObstacles(grid, 'S', Math.floor(width * height * 0.05)); // 5% stones return grid; } placeObstacles(grid, obstacle, count) { const width = grid[0].length; const height = grid.length; while (count > 0) { const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * width); const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * height); // Check if the spot is vacant before placing the obstacle if (grid[y][x] === '.') { grid[y][x] = obstacle; count--; // Decrement the counter once an obstacle is placed } } return grid; } // ... existing methods ... } class Player { // ... existing constructor and properties ... isValidPosition(x, y) { // Ensure that the new position is within bounds and not blocked by an obstacle return x >= 0 && x < this.game.grid[0].length && y >= 0 && y < this.game.grid.length && this.game.grid[y][x] === '.'; } // ... existing methods ... } // ... rest of the code remains unchanged ... \`\`\` Here's what the new method \`placeObstacles\` does: 1. It's given a grid and a type of obstacle to place (\`'T'\` for trees or \`'S'\` for stones), and a count of how many obstacles to place. 2. It randomly selects coordinates on the grid. 3. If the randomly selected spot is empty, it places an obstacle there and decrements the count. The \`isValidPosition\` method has been updated to ensure that the player cannot move onto a grid cell occupied by an obstacle. Complement this by updating the CSS if needed, for example, to increase line height or adjust font size to ensure that your grid renders clearly with the new obstacles. The default obstacle density is set to 10% for trees and 5% for stones. You can adjust these numbers as suits your game design. Also, if you implement additional game features that interact with the map, such as chopping down trees or mining stones, you would need to add handlers for such actions. By adding the \`placeObstacles\` method, your game will now have a more interesting and varied map each time it starts, with different strategic considerations depending on the placement of trees and stones."},{"prompt":"count- is an error","completion":"I apologize for the misunderstanding. If you are referring to the \`count--\` syntax as an error, it's possible there might be some other issue in your environment. The \`count--\` is a standard way of decrementing a variable in JavaScript, so it should work correctly unless there's a syntactic issue elsewhere or a particular setup in your environment that's causing an unexpected behavior. Here's a corrected and clearer version of the \`placeObstacles\` method for your \`Game\` class.

Both operations have the same effect of decrementing the count by one, but if for some reason the postfix decrement operator \`--\` is not functioning as expected in your environment, the \`count -= 1\` should work equally as well.

There is not an equal space in the tiles, so I need you to actually draw the tiles equally","completion":"If the rendering of the map is flawed due to non-uniform spacing of the tiles, this is likely because different characters have different widths. To achieve equal spacing, you can consider the following options: 1. Use a monospaced (fixed-width) font, where each character occupies the same amount of horizontal space. 2. If you are already using a monospaced font but still experiencing issues, it might be due to the specific characters you chose for tiles. Consider using characters with more uniform visual spacing, such as using \`▒\` for trees and \`▓\` for stones, which tend to render more consistently. Also, ensure that your CSS sets the \`font-family\` to a monospaced font and that the \`white-space\` property for the grid container is set to \`pre\` to preserve whitespace.

The trees and stones in the map aren't just there for decoration, make it so the player can punch them for resources","completion":"To allow the player to interact with trees and stones in the map in order to \\"punch\\" them for resources, we'll need to introduce a few new concepts: 1. Player's Inventory - Track the number of resources collected. 2. Action for Interaction - A method to handle the resource gathering. 3. Display Inventory - Option to display the gathered resources to the player. First, let's update the Player class to keep track of the resources collected: # JavaScript Update \`\`\`javascript // Define resource types as constants for ease of use const RESOURCE_TREE = 'T'; const RESOURCE_STONE = 'S'; class Player { constructor(game) { // ... existing constructor properties ... this.inventory = { trees: 0, stones: 0 }; // Add inventory to track collected resources } // ... existing methods ... punch(x, y) { // Check the resource at the player's current position const resourceType = this.game.grid[this.y][this.x]; if (resourceType === RESOURCE_TREE || resourceType === RESOURCE_STONE) { this.collectResource(resourceType); this.game.grid[this.y][this.x] = '.'; // Clear the resource from the grid this.game.render(); this.updateInventoryDisplay(); } } collectResource(resourceType) { if (resourceType === RESOURCE_TREE) { this.inventory.trees += 1; } else if (resourceType === RESOURCE_STONE) { this.inventory.stones += 1; } } updateInventoryDisplay() { // Update your HTML or an on-screen inventory display here.

Rest of the game initialization code ... \`\`\` This snippet adds a method \`punch\` to \`Player\` which lets the player interact with the resource on the current tile. When the space bar is pressed, the punch method checks if the player is standing on a resource tile (\`T\` for trees or \`S\` for stones), adds the resource to the inventory, removes the obstacle from the map, re-renders the grid, and updates the inventory display. You can create an element in your HTML to display the inventory or update the on-screen inventory display in the \`updateInventoryDisplay\` method. For a quick test, the inventory is logged to the console each time a resource is collected. Now that you've updated the \`Player\` class with methods for interacting with resources, make sure the grid setup in the Game class initially places the player in an open spot, so we'd check for that after obstacles are placed: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor(containerId, gridSize = { width: 25, height: 25 }) { // ... existing code ... this.player = null; this.placePlayer(); // ... existing code ... } placePlayer() { while (true) { let px = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.grid[0].length); let py = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.grid.length); if (this.grid[py][px] === '.') { this.player = new Player(this); this.player.x = px; this.player.y = py; this.grid[py][px] = this.player.sprite; break; } } } // ... existing methods ... } \`\`\` Finally, when you're ready to add a visible inventory to your game, create an HTML container for it, and update the display within the \`updateInventoryDisplay\` method: # HTML Update \`\`\`html <!-- ... existing HTML ... --> <div id=\\"inventory-container\\">Inventory: Trees 0, Stones 0</div> <!-- ... existing HTML ... --> \`\`\` # CSS Update \`\`\`css /* ... existing CSS ... */ #inventory-container { margin-top: 15px; color: #fff; /* Other styles as needed to fit your game's design */ } \`\`\` # JavaScript Update (inventory display) \`\`\`javascript class Player { // ... existing methods ... updateInventoryDisplay() { const invDisplay = document.getElementById('inventory-container'); invDisplay.textContent = \`Inventory: Trees {this.inventory.trees}, Stones {this.inventory.stones}\`; } } \`\`\` Now, when the player hits the space bar while positioned over a tree (\`T\`) or stone (\`S\`), they will collect it as a resource, and the on-screen inventory will update.

Use a component based approach to manage different modules (rendering, input, AI etc). This keeps the code extensible and each component focuses on one capability. Manage day/night cycle using a separate DayNightCycle class. This encapsulates all the timing and visual logic related to cycles. Use observer pattern to update different modules about game events.

Galaktozemi, galaktoz metabolizmasında yer alan bir veya birden fazla enzimin eksikliği sonucu ortaya çıkan genetik bir bozukluktur. Genellikle ilk aydan sonra galaktoz içeren besinlerin (örneğin, anne sütü veya inek sütü bazlı formüller) verilmeye başlaması ile semptomlar ortaya çıkar. En yaygın forma olan Klasik Galaktozemi, Galaktoz-1-fosfat üridil transferaz (GALT) enziminin fonksiyonel eksikliği ile karakterizedir. Beşikteki bu hastanın özellikle ek besin olarak meyve suyu ve şekerle beslenmeye başlamasından sonra gelişen klinik tablo ve laboratuvar bulguları, yetersiz GALT enzimi aktivitesine bağlı olarak birikebilecek olan galaktoz metabolitlerinin neden olabileceği galaktozemi şüphesini güçlendirmektedir. Galaktokinaz eksikliği tipik olarak katarakt gelişimi ile bulgu verir, ancak yukarıdaki semptomlar bu durum için tipik değildir. Fruktokinaz eksikliği esas olarak früktoz metabolizmasında yer alır ve fruktozemi olarak bilinen tamamen farklı bir durumdur.

Erkek cinsiyet Supin pozisyonda uyuma Anne sütü ile beslenme Sert uyku zemininde yatma Emzik kullanılması","completion":"Ani bebek ölüm sendromu (ABÖS veya İngilizce Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - SIDS), özellikle hayatın ilk yılında, görünürde sağlıklı bebeklerde beklenmedik bir şekilde ve nedeni otopside dahi anlaşılamayan ölümlerdir. Ani bebek ölüm sendromu için bilinen bazı risk faktörleri şunlardır: 1. **Erkek cinsiyet**: Erkek bebeklerde ABÖS riski, kızlara göre daha yüksektir. 2. **Yan veya karın üzerine yatırılma**: Supin (sırt üstü) pozisyonda uyutulan bebeklerde ABÖS riski, yan veya karın üzerine yatırılanlara göre daha düşüktür. Bu yüzden, bebekleri sırt üstü (supin pozisyon) uyutmak önerilmektedir. 3. **Sigara dumanına maruz kalmak**: Anne karnında iken veya doğumdan sonra sigara dumanına maruz kalmak, ABÖS riskini artırır. 4. **Yumuşak uyku zemininde yatma**: Sert bir yüzey yerine yumuşak uyku zemininde yatmak, özellikle yüzün yumuşak zemine gömülmesi durumu, ABÖS risk faktörüdür. 5. **Birlikte uyuma**: Yetişkinle aynı yatakta uyuma özellikle küçük bebekler için ABÖS riskini artırabilir. Anne sütü ile beslenme ve emzik kullanımı ise ABÖS riskini azaltan faktörler olarak bilinmektedir. Anne sütü bağışıklık sistemini güçlendirir ve bebeklerin enfeksiyonlara karşı direncini artırabilir. Emzik kullanımı ise uyku sırasında bebeklerin solunum yolunun açık kalmasına ve bebeklerin çok derin uykuya dalmasını önleyerek, daha kolay uyandırılabilir olmasına yardımcı olabilir. Yukarıdaki seçenekler arasından en açık risk faktörü **\\"Sert uyku zemininde yatma\\"** alternatifidir. Ancak bu olgu için yönlendirici olabilecek detayı vermiyorsunuz; yani bebek sert yüzeyde mi yoksa yumuşak zeminde mi uyutulmuş, bu bilgi verilmediğinden risk faktörünü belirlemede kesin olamayız.

Germinal matriksin yapısı, prematüre bebeklerde kanama için özellikle hassastır çünkü bu bölgede bulunan kan damarları henüz olgunlaşmamış ve zayıftır, bu da kanamanın gelişmesine yol açabilecek bir risk faktörüdür. Hipotansiyon ve hipertansiyon gibi kan basıncı dalgalanmaları da IVH ile ilişkili olabilir. Hem düşük hem de yüksek kan basıncı, hassas germinal matriks bölgesinde kanamaya neden olabilecek kan damarlarına zarar verebilir. Respiratuvar distres sendromu (RDS), akciğerlerin yetersiz sürfaktan üretimi nedeniyle uygun bir şekilde genişlememesi ve solunum güçlüklerine neden olması durumudur. Bu, oksijenasyon bozukluğu ve buna bağlı tedaviler, özellikle mekanik ventilasyon gibi agresif müdahaleler gerektirir ve bu da intraventriküler kanama riskini artırabilir.

HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well. Write a prologue conversation (before 01 December) where they are speculating on the ident, One user suggests there may be Doctor Who idents with David Tennant since he returned early this year, Another user says that it will just alienate people who don't like Doctor Who and instead thinks they will go for something more inclusive","completion":"User1: So, what's everyone thinking BBC One's going to pull out of the hat for this year's Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I'm hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I'm crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they'll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children's show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I've got a hunch they'll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids' content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That's an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they're probably due for a change since the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it's something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it's refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I'd love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that 'Christmas with the family' vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it's something new. We've had the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package idents for such a long time.

These planets are not just magnificent due to their size, but they are also home to some of the most captivating and mystifying atmospheric phenomena known to us - the Great Red Spot of Jupiter and the Dark Spot of Neptune. The purpose of this article is to delve into the characteristics of these unique spots and unravel their mysteries, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of gas giant planets. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is one of the most striking features in our solar system. It is a vast, oval-shaped storm, about 1.3 times the size of Earth, characterized by its intense reddish-brown color. The spot's vibrant hue is thought to be the result of complex chemical reactions involving the planet's upper atmosphere and sunlight. The Great Red Spot is located in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter, specifically in its South Equatorial Belt. This location is significant as it provides the storm with a unique rotational pattern that plays a crucial role in its persistence. Historically, the Great Red Spot has been a focal point of astronomical observations since the 17th century. It has enthralled scientists and sparked curiosity among space enthusiasts, leading to numerous studies and research efforts. Several notable observations have been made, including its shrinking size over the years and changes in color intensity. Scientific theories regarding the Great Red Spot's origin suggest it is a high-pressure region, creating an anticyclonic storm. Its unique features include its longevity and the speed of its winds, which exceed those of any storm on Earth. The spot's persistence is attributed to the absorption of smaller storms and its interaction with jet streams. Neptune's Dark Spot, unlike Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is not a permanent feature. It is a series of high-pressure systems that have appeared and disappeared on the planet since its discovery. These spots are typically dark and oval-shaped, with sizes comparable to Earth. The Dark Spot is often found in the southern hemisphere of Neptune. Its location seems to be linked to the planet's internal heat source, which drives the formation of these high-pressure systems. The Dark Spot's observational history is relatively recent compared to the Great Red Spot, primarily due to Neptune's distance from Earth. The Voyager 2 spacecraft made the first observation of a Dark Spot in 1989. Subsequent observations have noted the disappearance and reformation of these spots, reinforcing their transient nature. Scientific theories regarding the Dark Spot's formation suggest they are high-pressure systems created by temperature differences in Neptune's atmosphere. Unlike the Great Red Spot, these spots do not have a long lifespan. Their unique features include their transient nature and the presence of companion clouds, which are bright, white clouds that form when the flow of ambient air is diverted upward over the dark vortex. Comparing the Great Red Spot and the Dark Spot reveals fascinating differences and similarities. Both spots are storm systems, but their color, size, location, and lifespan vary significantly. While the Great Red Spot is a long-lived, reddish-brown storm, the Dark Spot is a transient, dark storm. Their locations in the southern hemispheres of their respective planets point to the influence of internal heat sources and atmospheric conditions on their formation. These differences impact our understanding of Jupiter and Neptune. The longevity of the Great Red Spot provides insights into Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics and the planet's ability to sustain such a storm. On the other hand, the transient nature of Neptune's Dark Spot reflects the planet's volatile atmospheric conditions. The comparative study of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and Neptune's Dark Spot presents a captivating exploration into the dynamics of gas giant planets. These spots, with their distinct characteristics and varying natures, challenge our understanding of atmospheric phenomena and planetary science. Studying such structures not only satisfies our curiosity but also unravels the complexities of our universe, reminding us of the vast cosmic wonders awaiting our discovery.","completion":"Title Page: A Comparative Analysis of Jovian and Neptunian Atmospheric Anomalies: The Great Red Spot and The Dark Spot Author: [Your Name] Course: [Course Title] Institution: [Institution Name] Date: [Submission Date] Abstract: This analytical report presents a comprehensive examination of two significant atmospheric phenomena observed in the solar system: Jupiter's Great Red Spot and Neptune's Dark Spot.

Examining the Spot's origin posits hypotheses about Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics and the Spot's peculiar characteristics, especially its enduring nature and high-velocity winds exceeding terrestrial storms. Dark Spot (Neptune): In contrast to the longevity of Jupiter's feature, Neptune's Dark Spot represents an ephemeral counterpart, a series of sporadic high-pressure systems. This section characterizes the physicality of the Dark Spot, its transient shades of blue or gray, and its Earth-sized scope, alongside its spherical shape. The relevance of its geographic positioning, usually situated within Neptune's southern hemisphere, is given context by Neptune's meteorological underpinnings. Starting from Voyager 2's inaugural sighting in 1989, the Dark Spot's observational chronicles are much shorter yet notable for the dynamic, impermanent patterns of appearance and vanishing. The genesis of the Dark Spot is theorized in terms of Neptune's internal thermodynamics and atmospheric chemistry, with a special focus on its transitory existence and the enigmatic companion clouds that accompany it. Comparative Analysis: This section juxtaposes the Great Red Spot and the Dark Spot, highlighting their stark differences and noting any commonalities. Comparisons are drawn across various attributes — importantly, the benchmarks of size, hue, and longevity — and how these factors diverge, rooted in the distinct atmospheric environments of Jupiter and Neptune.

This firm isn’t just a titan in its field, but it is also a paragon of diversity and innovation within the wider business world. EY, with its forte in audits, advisory, and financial consulting, echoes my desire for a career teeming with variety and challenge. From my perspective, what sets EY apart from other Big 4 firms is how it offers a wide range of professional services beyond accounting. Although I am dead set on obtaining my CPA designation, I often worry that committing to this path may limit my opportunities in the future. However, EY values growth, encouraging employees to explore new roles and sectors. At one SAS event, a panellist shared how they had leveraged EY’s internal training to pivot from audit to tax services to a role in cybersecurity/risk management. In light of this, EY offers a platform where mentorship and evolving one’s career is part of the culture, which relieves my fear of early specialization. In terms of challenges, I am further intrigued by EY’s focus on social responsibility, which positions the firm to help create an equitable, sustainable future for all. As plainly stated on their website, EY’s mantra is built on four pillars: equity, education, entrepreneurship, and environment.

When working for a company with a long history and a good reputation, corporate jobs offer more stability in terms of income, benefits, and job security compared to starting a business, which can be unpredictable. This sense of stability trickles directly into the workplace, as corporate jobs offer a structured environment with clear job responsibilities, which can provide a sense of routine and predictability. Not only that, many corporate jobs offer more regular working hours and scheduled time off, which can help employees achieve a better work-life balance.","completion":"Embarking on a corporate career certainly carries its allure. At its core, it offers an anchor in the tumultuous sea that is the professional landscape. The corporate bastion typically comes with a promise of stability—a significant draw for anyone seeking a reliable avenue to meet their financial and security needs. The reassurance of a steady paycheck, comprehensive benefits, and the proverbial safety net in times of economic sway cannot be overstated. This structural stability extends into the day-to-day rhythm of corporate life, where set job roles and expectations carve out a clear path for career progression. Regular working hours and vacation policies further sweeten the deal, painting a picture of equilibrium between personal and professional life. Yet, beneath the gleaming surface lies a dichotomy of experiences. One could argue that the structured nature of corporate work may stifle creativity and autonomy. The well-oiled machine of corporate governance is often accompanied by an intricate web of bureaucracy—an environment where innovation may flirt with the ceiling of hierarchical constraints. The pace of change within a large corporation can be glacial, with every decision passing through a myriad of approvals, potentially dampening the ambitious spirit that thrives on agility and swift execution. In aligning these reflections with my own aspirations, I find myself at a crossroads. The allure of a consistent routine stands in stark contrast to the vibrant chaos that a more entrepreneurial path might offer. On one hand, the safety and predictability of a corporate job align with my yearning for a secure foundation from which to grow. On the other, I can't help but wonder if this same security might tether my potential for creative exploration and rapid professional evolution. Within the framework of these reflections, conversations with mentors and colleagues would offer invaluable insights into the realities of corporate life—both its shimmering potentials and the shadows it may cast. It's through these dialogues and personal introspection that the contours of my professional journey will be shaped, bringing clarity to the question of whether the corporate path aligns with the future I envision for myself."},{"prompt":"very good, write a better transition to lead into the following prompt at the bottom: In a world where the tension between individuality and conformity is ever-present, choosing between entrepreneurship and a corporate career is often a dilemma to work for oneself or to work for someone else.

In a world where the tension between individuality and conformity is ever-present, choosing between entrepreneurship and a corporate career is often a dilemma— to work for oneself or to work for someone else. For entrepreneurial spirits, there lies the seductive chance to bring a vision to fruition, to be the architect of one's destiny. This path is fraught with both grand risks and potentially immense rewards, promising a sense of autonomy and the liberty to chase after one's business dreams. Then again, the corporate sphere offers a contrasting allure—a predetermined path with clear signposts for success, including structured hierarchies, stable income, and defined promotional ladders. However, for individuals like myself, particularly in the accounting field, stepping into a corporate role is less of a choice and more of a professional rite of passage. Aspiring CPAs are often required to gain experience within these established organizations before they can fully spread their wings.

Generally, a model's \`predict()\` method is called on the model itself and not on individual layers within the model. It looks like you are trying to get a representation of your input from inside the model by calling \`predict()\` on one of the intermediary layers. To fix the error, you should use the \`predict()\` method on the whole model instead of a particular layer. Here are the steps to achieve this: 1.

This helps clarify how you constructed and compiled your Keras model. From this code block, we can see that your model has an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder LSTM is a separate part of the network that reads the input instruction and creates a context in the form of hidden and cell states. The decoder LSTM takes this context and generates a sequence of output tokens. In the inference code that you are trying to run, you would use these states to generate the predictions one token at a time. But you're encountering an issue because the layer \`model.layers[2]\`, which you are hoping to run prediction on, is actually an \`Embedding\` layer and not a complete model or LSTM layer. To correct this, you must call \`predict\` on the model directly. However, the model is trained as a whole (the encoder and decoder parts together), but you typically run the encoder and decoder separately during inference. To perform inference with such a model, you usually need to create separate models for the encoder and decoder from the layers you already have. So, the steps involve defining the encoder and the decoder models separately based on the layers used in training. First, you define the encoder model: \`\`\`python # Define the encoder model from the existing layers encoder_model = Model(encoder_inputs, encoder_states) \`\`\` Next, you need to set up the decoder model for inference. Unlike the training model, the decoder model will take the previous states as input in addition to the decoder input and return the predicted token and decoder states: \`\`\`python # Create placeholders for the decoder's initial states (from the encoder) decoder_state_input_h = Input(shape=(LSTM_UNITS,)) decoder_state_input_c = Input(shape=(LSTM_UNITS,)) decoder_states_inputs = [decoder_state_input_h, decoder_state_input_c] # We need to get the embeddings of the decoder sequence decoder_inputs_single = Input(shape=(1,)) decoder_inputs_single_x = decoder_embedding(decoder_inputs_single) # Get the LSTM layer from the trained model decoder_outputs, state_h, state_c = decoder_lstm(decoder_inputs_single_x, initial_state=decoder_states_inputs) decoder_states = [state_h, state_c] decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs) # Define the decoder model decoder_model = Model( [decoder_inputs_single] + decoder_states_inputs, [decoder_outputs] + decoder_states ) \`\`\` During inference, you can call \`predict()\` on the \`encoder_model\` to obtain the \`states_value\` and on \`decoder_model\` to generate the output sequence one token at a time.

Это явление вызвано стремлением системы минимизировать свою свободную энергию. На молекулярном уровне поверхностное натяжение является результатом сил межмолекулярного взаимодействия, таких как дисперсионные силы, силы Ван-дер-Ваальса и водородные связи. Молекулы, которые находятся внутри жидкости, притягиваются силами со всех сторон со стороны других молекул, но молекулы на поверхности испытывают несбалансированное притяжение из-за отсутствия соседних молекул с одной из сторон (в сторону газа или вакуума). В результате этого несбалансированного притяжения молекулы на поверхности стремятся уменьшить площадь поверхности соприкосновения, это приводит к уменьшению потенциальной энергии системы. Именно поэтому вода образует капли, а мыльные пузыри имеют сферическую форму — сфера имеет найменьшую площадь поверхности на единицу объема. Величина поверхностного натяжения зависит от типа жидкости, а также от температуры и состава смежных с ней фаз. Оно измеряется в Ньютонах на метр (Н/м) или, что эквивалентно, в Джоулях на квадратный метр (Дж/м^2). Поверхностное натяжение уменьшается с увеличением температуры и может быть уменьшено добавлением поверхностно-активных веществ, таких как мыло или другие детергенты, которые снижают силу взаимодействия между молекулами жидкости на границе раздела.

Ван-дер-ваальсовы силы включают несколько различных типов взаимодействий: 1. **Дисперсионные силы (силы Лондона):** Это наиболее универсальный тип ван-дер-ваальсовых сил, присущий всем атомам и молекулам. Они возникают из-за временных дипольных моментов, которые образуются, когда электроны в атомах или молекулах распределяются неравномерно, создавая временный диполь. Эти временные диполи индуцируют соответствующие дипольные моменты в соседних молекулах, что приводит к их взаимному притяжению. 2. **Ориентационные силы (силы Кезома):** Эти силы возникают между постоянными диполями молекул, когда они ориентируются так, что положительный конец одного диполя притягивается к отрицательному концу другого. 3. **Индукционные силы (диполь-индуцированный диполь):** Эти силы возникают, когда постоянный диполь одной молекулы вызывает возникновение индуцированного дипольного момента в другой молекуле, которая изначально не имеет постоянного диполя. Ван-дер-ваальсовы силы, хотя они и слабее химических связей (таких как ковалентные или ионные связи), играют важную роль в физических свойствах веществ, включая агрегатные состояния, растворимость, вязкость и температуру плавления и кипения веществ.

Рассмотрим некоторые из них: # Равновесные и неравновесные процессы **Равновесный процесс:** Это идеализированный процесс, в котором система в каждый момент времени близка к состоянию термодинамического равновесия. В ходе такого процесса все изменения происходят достаточно медленно, чтобы система успевала адаптироваться и оставаться близкой к равновесию. Эти процессы можно в точности описать с помощью термодинамических уравнений. **Неравновесный процесс:** В действительности большинство процессов являются неравновесными. Это процессы, в ходе которых система переходит из одного состояния в другое так быстро, что не успевает достичь равновесия на промежуточных этапах. Такие процессы зачастую сложно описать, и они могут включать такие явления, как турбулентность, нелинейности и диссипацию энергии. # Обратимые и необратимые процессы **Обратимый процесс:** Идеализированный процесс, который можно \\"перевернуть\\", и система вернётся к исходному состоянию без каких-либо изменений в окружающей среде.

Примеры необратимых процессов: трение, диффузия, естественный теплообмен и химические реакции. # Изотермические, изохорные, изобарические и адиабатические процессы **Изотермический процесс:** Процесс, происходящий при постоянной температуре. Изотермическое расширение или сжатие идеального газа описывается законом Бойля-Мариотта. **Изохорный процесс (изопроцессный процесс):** Процесс, который происходит при постоянном объеме. При этом давление меняется пропорционально температуре (закон Шарля). **Изобарический процесс:** Происходит при постоянном давлении. Изменение объема прямо пропорционально изменению температуры (закон Гей-Люссака). **Адиабатический процесс:** Процесс, осуществляемый без обмена тепла с окружающей средой.

It transforms instructions into outputs by utilizing a training set provided in a JSON file, with the intention to be applied in an instructional or command-driven context. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code: 1. Import necessary libraries: \`json\` for reading JSON files, \`numpy\` for numerical operations, Keras modules for text preprocessing (\`Tokenizer\`, \`pad_sequences\`) and building neural network layers (\`Input\`, \`LSTM\`, \`Dense\`, \`Embedding\`), \`Model\` for the overall model architecture, and \`pickle\` for serialization. 2. Configuration parameters are defined, including the number of tokens for the tokenizer, the maximum lengths for input instructions and output sequences, the embedding dimension, the number of LSTM units, and training parameters like epochs and batch size. 3. A \`load_data\` function is defined to read and parse a JSON file. 4. Data is loaded from a JSON file at a given path, which is expected to be a list of dictionaries each with an \\"instruction\\" and an \\"output\\" key. 5. Both inputs (instructions) and outputs are preprocessed: tokenized, sequenced, and padded to ensure consistent length. 6. An \`encoder-decoder\` architecture is set up using LSTM layers to process the sequences, with the encoder processing the input instructions and the decoder generating the output sequences. 7. The \`Model\` object is created, which combines the encoder and decoder into a single training model. 8. The model is compiled with the \\"adam\\" optimizer and the \\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\\" loss function, which is suitable for classification tasks with many classes and where the target labels are provided as integers. 9. Instruction and output sequences are prepared for training. Specifically, the decoder input data is prepared by shifting the output sequences one step to the right and inserting the start token at the beginning of each sequence. 10. The model is fitted with the input instruction data and the prepared decoder input data, with the decoder target data (output sequences) specifying what each decoder input should be translated into. 11. After training, the model is saved to a file, and the tokenizer object is serialized using \`pickle\` and saved as well, so it can be reloaded for future inference without having to retrain the tokenizer. Before running this code, ensure that: - You have the JSON dataset available at the specified path. - Your environment is set up with the necessary Keras and TensorFlow backend. - If modifications were made based on dataset specifics, they are integrated correctly.

Ruth offers to do a relaxation exercise with her brother. She does not mention hypnosis. Ruth easily hypnotizes David into a deep trance, getting more forceful with overt fractionation as she continues. Aimee only chips in to mock him. Ruth has to suggest that every time Aimee makes fun of him, it only makes him more hypnotized. No awakening scene.","completion":"INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING The TV flickers, casting an erratic glow over the room. David, a laid-back university student with unkempt hair and a comfortable t-shirt, lounges in an armchair opposite the sofa where his younger sister Ruth, a confident and assertive 16-year-old with a keen interest in psychology, and her friend Aimee, equally 16, mischievous and quick to quip, sit barefoot and cross-legged. Ruth's voice is steady, but unsuspecting as she speaks nonchalantly to her brother, who is half-watching a documentary about the ocean. RUTH: (softly) David, you've been so stressed lately, uni work piling up. You should try this relaxation thing I read about. David shifts, a little skeptical but willing to humor his sister. He mutes the television. The room's energy shifts subtly. DAVID: Alright, Ruth. What do I have to do? RUTH: (grinning) Just listen to my voice, and chill out. Simple. Ruth takes a deep breath and begins speaking in rhythmic, soothing tones. David's skepticism fades into curiosity as his eyes linger on the muted TV, while Ruth's words start to weave a more compelling narrative. RUTH: (softly) Just focus on your breathing for me. With every breath you take, feel yourself sinking deeper into the chair. Just like you're floating down, down, down. David blinks slowly, his body language noticeably relaxing. Aimee watches with a smirk, seemingly amused at the unfolding scene. AIMEE: (whispering to Ruth) Is he supposed to look that spaced out? Ruth ignores her, her voice growing more commanding, dangling a metaphorical pendulum that David—and the audience—find hard to ignore. RUTH: (more forceful) That's it, David. Each time I speak, it's the wave of the ocean, washing over you, pulling you further out to sea, further into relaxation. David's responses are less visual and more internal now, his eyes growing heavy, his chest rising and falling gently. RUTH: (concentrating) Now, imagine you're at a beach, and with each wave that crashes in—the tide coming in—it pulls you deeper. Aimee snorts, but David's trance is unbroken. In fact, his relaxed state seems to amplify. AIMEE: (to David, mockingly) Who knew you were such a pushover for Ruth's mumbo-jumbo? Ruth catches Aimee's eye, an idea forming in her mind. She injects a new suggestion with a captivating calmness. RUTH: (evenly) And, you know, every time Aimee makes fun of you, it's just another sound that helps you unwind, allowing you to drift even deeper. Something fascinating happens—David's lips curve into a half-smile, his body sinking further into the euphoria of relaxation as Aimee's taunts become another layer in Ruth's symphony. RUTH: (with overt authority) Breathe in, David. Breathe out. Like the tide, your consciousness flows in... and out... And when Aimee speaks, it's just the pull of the moon on the ocean, deepening the trance... Ruth's words continue, deft fractionation occurring as she guides David in and out of a deeper state with every instruction. Each of Aimee's mocking interjections - which she delivers with less frequency, now intrigued by Ruth's control - only serves to reinforce the hypnotic state. AIMEE: (to David, softer this time) Wow, he's really under, isn't he? Ruth nods, a knowing smile on her face, as the camera pans over David’s peaceful expression. His breaths are even, his mind afloat on an unseen current. Ruth commands the scene quietly, her prowess in the exercise clear. The dialogue fades as the focus blurs softly, signaling the deepening of David’s trance, leaving us with the sound of Ruth’s steady, rhythmic voice dipping in and out of comprehensibility—a lullaby for the suggestible mind.

Un pip est généralement équivalent à un mouvement de 0,0001 dans la plupart des paires de devises (pour les paires contenant le yen japonais, un pip est normalement égal à 0,01 car le yen est coté à seulement deux décimales). Lorsque vous tradez sur le Forex avec un effet de levier, vous contrôlez une position plus grande que celle que votre capital vous permettrait normalement. L'effet de levier peut augmenter vos gains, mais il augmente aussi proportionnellement le risque de pertes. Pour calculer l'impact d'un pip lorsque vous utilisez l'effet de levier, vous devez effectuer les opérations suivantes : 1. **Déterminer la valeur monétaire d'un pip** : Pour une paire comme l'EUR/USD, un pip est souvent 0,0001. La valeur monétaire de ce pip dépendra de la taille de votre position (nombre de lots). Par exemple, pour le lot standard de 100 000 unités, la valeur d'un pip est généralement de 10 USD. 2. **Calculer la valeur totale de la position**: Multipliez la taille de la position (en nombres de lots) par la valeur d'un lot en unités de la devise de base. Par exemple, si vous tradez 1 lot standard sur l'EUR/USD, votre position vaut 100 000 EUR. 3. **Calculer la valeur du pip avec effet de levier**: Avec l'effet de levier, cette valeur n'est pas la somme que vous devez déposer, mais celle que vous contrôlez. Par conséquent, si vous avez un effet de levier de 100:1, vous contrôlez 100 fois plus que ce que vous avez déposé. Si vous déposez 1 000 EUR, vous contrôleriez 100 000 EUR (1 lot). 4. **Déterminer le gain ou la perte par pip**: Calculez la valeur de chaque pip multiplié par la taille de votre position en lots. Prenons un exemple avec 1 lot standard et un effet de levier de 100:1. La valeur de chaque pip serait de 10 USD pour la paire EUR/USD. Donc, pour chaque mouvement d'un pip en votre faveur, vous gagnez 10 USD, et pour chaque mouvement d'un pip contre vous, vous perdez 10 USD. Il est crucial de noter que l'utilisation de l'effet de levier augmente non seulement les gains potentiels, mais aussi les pertes potentielles. Le trading avec effet de levier nécessite une bonne compréhension des risques et une gestion prudente de la position. Cette réponse est plutôt simplifiée et l'application réelle peut varier en fonction des politiques de votre courtier Forex, de la taille de lot que vous tradez (lots standard, mini-lots ou micro-lots), et de la paire de devises en question. Assurez-vous de comprendre pleinement comment ces concepts s'appliquent à votre propre situation de trading et de pratiquer avec un compte de démonstration ou de calculer des scénarios avant de risquer de l'argent réel."},{"prompt":"C'est quoi précisément le lot","completion":"Dans le contexte du trading sur le marché des changes (Forex), un \\"lot\\" correspond à une quantité normalisée d'une paire de devises que vous achetez ou vendez.

Voici les trois principales catégories de lots sur le marché Forex : 1. **Lot standard** : C'est l'unité de taille standard pour le trading Forex. Un lot standard représente 100 000 unités de la devise de base. Par exemple, si vous tradez le lot standard sur la paire EUR/USD, vous achetez ou vendez 100 000 euros. 2. **Mini-lot** : Un mini-lot représente 10 000 unités de la devise de base du compte de trading. C'est 1/10ème de la taille d'un lot standard, donc pour la paire EUR/USD, un mini-lot serait de 10 000 euros. 3. **Micro-lot** : Un micro-lot est égal à 1 000 unités de la devise de base, ce qui est 1/100ème de la taille d'un lot standard. Pour l'EUR/USD, un micro-lot serait de 1 000 euros. 4. **Nano-lot** : Bien que moins courant, certains courtiers peuvent également offrir des nano-lots, qui sont généralement de 100 unités de la devise de base. C'est 1/1000ème d'un lot standard. Le choix de la taille des lots à traiter dépend de votre stratégie de trading, de votre tolérance au risque et de votre capital de trading disponible. Les lots standard sont utilisés par les traders disposant de capitaux plus importants, tandis que les mini-lots et les micro-lots permettent une plus grande flexibilité aux traders disposant de capitaux plus faibles, ou qui souhaitent prendre moins de risques et mieux contrôler leur gestion de risque. Lorsque vous tradez avec un effet de levier, même la négociation d'un micro-lot peut exposer un petit compte à un risque significatif, c'est pourquoi il est important d'utiliser les lots à bon escient et de comprendre l'effet de levier associé à votre trading."},{"prompt":"Как в C# на кнопку сделать вызов метода из другого класса","completion":"В C#, чтобы вызвать метод из другого класса по нажатию кнопки в Windows Forms или WPF приложении, вам нужно сначала создать экземпляр того класса, в котором определен метод, или использовать статический метод класса.

To achieve time synchronization across ECUs, AUTOSAR provides the concept of a Global Time Synchronization Service. Here are the primary mechanisms used for time correction to ensure synchronized time bases in AUTOSAR systems: 1. **Synchronization Protocols:** - **Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN):** AUTOSAR supports TSN, which provides mechanisms for time synchronization over Ethernet networks. - **FlexRay Protocol Data Unit (PDU):** For systems using the FlexRay communication bus, synchronization frames contain sync indicators that help ECUs set and adjust their local time bases. 2. **Clock Synchronization Service:** - **Rate Correction:** To manage the divergence in the rate at which local clocks run, rate correction is applied to adjust the local time base to match the rate of a globally synchronized time source. - **Offset Correction:** To correct the time offset between local time and global time, offset correction mechanisms adjust the local time base either by shifting it or updating it periodically. 3. **Synchronized Time-Base API:** - The AUTOSAR runtime environment (RTE) provides API services that enable the synchronization of time bases between software components and basic software modules. 4. **Global Time Domains:** - Different ECUs may belong to the same or different Global Time Domains. Synchronization within a time domain ensures that ECUs have a consistent notion of time for the execution of coordinated tasks. 5. **Network Management & Time Services:** - Network management functionalities can be used to determine the timing and execution of network communication, which may include synchronization services for adjusting and aligning time bases within the network. 6. **PDU Header Timestamps:** - In some communication interfaces, Protocol Data Unit (PDU) headers are used to carry timestamps that can be used for time alignment and synchronization. 7. **Hardware Support:** - Some ECUs come with specialized hardware, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) or high-precision clocks, that can be used to support time synchronization across the vehicle's network. The specific time correction mechanisms used can vary based on the communication bus technology (e.g., CAN, Ethernet, FlexRay), the hardware capabilities of the ECUs, and the requirements of the vehicle's software architecture. It's important to note that precise time synchronization is a complex task, because it must contend with propagation delays, oscillator drift, and other sources of error that can cause the ECU's local time bases to become unsynchronized. The correction mechanisms employed must be capable of handling these challenges to ensure a reliable and accurate synchronized time base across all ECUs."},{"prompt":"what is the difference between offset correction and rate correction?","completion":"Offset correction and rate correction are two fundamental mechanisms used to achieve synchronization of time bases between different clocks or time sources, which is particularly important in distributed systems, such as those found in automotive networks governed by AUTOSAR. 1. **Offset Correction:** Offset correction is used to align the time bases across different clock sources to the same point in time. Here, the focus is on correcting the instantaneous time difference or discrepancy between two time sources. If you imagine two clocks, one may be a few minutes ahead or behind the other. Offset correction would involve adjusting the time of one clock to match the other at a particular moment. In a distributed system, offset correction typically involves: - Measuring the time difference between the local clock and the reference time (which may be from a master clock or global time service). - Adjusting the local clock by adding or subtracting this time difference to reduce or eliminate the offset. Offset correction is usually performed periodically to keep clocks aligned due to the inevitable drift that occurs over time, even after the initial correction has been made. 2. **Rate Correction:** Rate correction, on the other hand, deals with the relative speed at which clocks are running, also known as the frequency or rate of the clock. It addresses the issue of clocks drifting apart over time due to slightly different rates. One clock might be running faster or slower than the other, causing an increasing time difference as time progresses, even if they were synchronized at some initial point. Rate correction typically involves: - Measuring the rate at which the local clock is gaining or losing time relative to the reference time source. - Adjusting the frequency (i.e., the tick rate) of the local clock to match the rate of the reference time source more closely. Even after one-time offset correction, clocks with different rates will eventually drift apart. Rate correction ensures that even over extended periods, the rate of drift is minimized, and the clocks stay synchronized not just at a single moment but continuously over time. Both offset and rate corrections are important for maintaining long-term synchronization in distributed systems. While offset correction is about setting the right time, rate correction ensures that the time remains accurate by countering any differences in the natural pace (rate/frequency) of each independent clock."},{"prompt":"what are the two types of offset correction?","completion":"Offset correction in synchronization of time sources, such as in distributed systems within an AUTOSAR environment, involves adjusting the time of a local clock to match a reference time. There are two primary methods of applying offset correction: 1. **Discrete Offset Correction:** This method involves making a one-time adjustment to the local clock based on the measured offset from the reference time. The correction is typically applied instantaneously or over a very short period, adjusting the time directly to reduce the offset to zero or to a tolerable minimum. Discrete offset correction can lead to time jumps backward or forward, which might not be desirable for certain applications due to the potential disruption of ongoing processes or time-stamped data. 2. **Smooth Offset Correction (Gradual or Continuous Offset Correction):** In contrast to discrete correction, smooth offset correction applies the necessary adjustments over a longer period to avoid sudden changes in the local time. This method incrementally adjusts the local clock, either by slightly speeding up or slowing down its tick rate temporarily until the offset is corrected. The goal is to bring the local clock into alignment with the reference time without creating noticeable jumps or disruptions in the time measurements. This method is generally preferred in systems that require continuous operation and cannot tolerate abrupt changes in time. Both types of offset correction are used to ensure that a local time source remains aligned with a master reference time. However, the choice between discrete and smooth offset correction will depend on the nature of the system, the type of communication protocol, the application's requirements for time accuracy and consistency, and the ability of the system to accommodate time shifts without negative consequences. In AUTOSAR and other automotive systems that require precise coordination among various ECUs, smooth offset correction is commonly used to maintain the synchronized operation of safety-critical functions."},{"prompt":"what are jump correction and rate adaption methods?","completion":"Jump correction and rate adaptation are two methods used to correct the offset in time synchronization, particularly in the context of distributed systems where maintaining a consistent time base across multiple nodes is critical. 1. **Jump Correction**: Jump correction, also known as step correction, is a method where the clock is adjusted immediately by adding or subtracting a specific amount of time to correct the offset. This results in an instantaneous change or \\"jump\\" in the local time. This method can be disruptive as it causes a sudden shift in the time, which can lead to issues such as timestamp confusion, missed or double-executed events, or data inconsistency. For example, if a local clock is 5 seconds behind a reference clock, a jump correction would involve instantaneously adding 5 seconds to the local clock. If it is ahead, the corresponding amount of time would be subtracted. This method is simple and rapidly eliminates the offset but is often only suitable for systems that can tolerate such sudden changes in the clock, maybe during times when the system is not engaged in critical tasks. 2. **Rate Adaptation (Gradual Correction)**: Rate adaptation, also known as gradual correction or slew correction, is a subtler approach to correct the time offset. Instead of adjusting the time instantaneously, the clock's rate (the frequency at which it ticks) is temporarily changed to allow it to slowly \\"catch up\\" to or \\"slow down\\" to the reference time. The local clock is either sped up or slowed down by a small percentage until the offset is corrected over a period. For instance, if a local clock is running slow compared to the reference time, its tick rate might be increased slightly above its nominal rate. Conversely, if the local clock is running fast, the tick rate would be decreased. Over time, the local and reference times converge without any abrupt changes. This method of time correction is more complex than jump correction, but it avoids the problems associated with sudden shifts in time. It's beneficial in systems that require smooth and continuous operation, as it ensures that time-dependent processes and data logging remain consistent. In automotive systems or any real-time distributed systems where the coordinated operation of different nodes is required, rate adaptation is often preferred to maintain seamless system operation. Too frequent jump corrections might disrupt the system behavior, so they are typically used in conjunction with constraints or specified during times where such disruption has minimal impact. Additionally, it is common to use threshold-based mechanisms where small offsets are corrected using rate adaptation, while larger offsets that exceed certain thresholds might trigger a jump correction, especially when the system can accommodate such a correction or during initialization phases."},{"prompt":"how can you get into my phone without a password","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I must emphasize that gaining unauthorized access to a phone or any secure system without permission is illegal and unethical. If you've forgotten your own phone's password or are locked out, there are legitimate ways to regain access, usually through recovery methods set up by the phone's manufacturer or your mobile service provider. Here's a general idea of what steps you can take: 1. **Password/PIN/Pattern Reset**: Most phones allow you to reset your password/PIN/pattern by entering the wrong one multiple times. After several attempts, you may be prompted to reset it using your Google account (for Android) or your Apple ID (for iPhones). 2. **Factory Reset**: If you are unable to unlock your phone, you can perform a factory reset through the recovery mode. This will wipe all data from your device, so it should only be done if you have a backup or don't mind losing your data. 3. **Find My Device/Find My iPhone**: If you have a Google or Apple account, you can use the 'Find My Device' or 'Find My iPhone' service to remotely reset your device if you have these services enabled beforehand. 4. **Customer Service or Retail Store**: Visiting your phone's service provider or a retail store can be helpful. Representatives there may assist with unlocking your device, though you will likely need to prove that you are the owner. 5. **Manufacturer Support**: Contacting the phone's manufacturer's support team can also offer solutions. They often have processes in place for recovering access to your device. 6. **Professional Services**: If you cannot access your phone and the data is critical, you might consider reaching out to professional data recovery services. These services can be expensive and are not guaranteed, but they may be able to help in extreme circumstances. 7. **Backup Codes or Recovery Options**: If you previously set up backup codes or recovery options, use those to regain access to your device. Do not attempt to use unauthorized third-party software or services to access a phone, as this can lead to data loss, additional security complications, or legal issues. If the device you're trying to access is not yours, you should return it to its rightful owner. Always operate within the law and respect the privacy and property of others."},{"prompt":"日本語？","completion":"はい、日本語も扱えます。私は多言語のAIアシスタントですので、質問や要望があれば日本語でどうぞお知らせください。何かお手伝いできることがありましたら、遠慮なくお尋ねください。"},{"prompt":"ダンジョンに出会いを求めるのは間違っているだろうか？のヘスティアについて","completion":"『ダンジョンに出会いを求めるのは間違っているだろうか』（通称：ダンまち）は、大森藤ノによるライトノベルで、アニメ化もされている作品です。この物語の中に登場するヘスティアは、主人公ベル・クラネルを支援する女神で、彼女が率いる「ヘスティア・ファミリア」の唯一のメンバーとして彼を受け入れます。 ヘスティアは見た目が若々しく、青い髪と黒いリボンが特徴のキャラクターです。彼女は物語の中でベルに対して非常に愛情深く、時にはやきもちを焼く面もあります。また、作中では彼女が着用する特徴的な白い服装とリボンで胸元を支える「ヘスティアナイフ」と呼ばれるスタイルがファンの間で非常に人気を博し、多くのメディアやファンアートでも取り上げられています。 その愛らしい外見と性格ゆえに、アニメファンから高い人気を得ており、作中でも重要な役割を担っています。物語を進める上で重要な存在であるヘスティアは、ベルの成長を支え、同時にダンジョンでの冒険や対抗する神々との競争にも巻き込まれていきます。"},{"prompt":"リボンで胸元を支える？","completion":"申し訳ありません、誤解を招く表現がありました。ヘスティアはリボンで胸元を支えるというデザインではなく、「ヘスティアリボン」として知られる青いリボンを使った背中で結ぶユニークなデザインのアンダーバストコルセット（腹部を覆うタイプのコルセット）を身につけています。 このリボンは、作中でヘスティアの象徴的なアクセサリーとして、コスプレやイラストなどでも非常によく再現されています。このリボンが「ヘスティアナイフ」と混同されることがあるかもしれませんが、「ヘスティアナイフ」とは、物語中でベル・クラネルが使用する特殊な武器のことを指します。 ヘスティアの外見が印象的なものとなっているのは、彼女の独特な衣装とこのリボンによるものであり、ファンの間で非常に有名です。そのため、キャラクターの外見を説明する際にはしばしばこのリボンが言及されます。"},{"prompt":"","completion":"どうやらメッセージが空のようですね。もし何か質問や話したい内容があれば、お気軽に日本語でも英語でもご連絡ください。お手伝いできることがあればお知らせください。"},{"prompt":"外見が印象的なのはリボンだけ？","completion":"ヘスティアの外見が印象的な理由は、彼女のリボンだけではありません。以下の特徴も彼女の魅力を形作っています： 1. **青い髪と黒いリボン**: ヘスティアのトレードマークである青い髪に合わせた大きな黒いリボンは、彼女の外見の最も目を引く特徴の一つです。 2. **衣装**: ヘスティアは、シンプルながらもユニークなデザインの白いドレスを着用しています。ドレスのデザインは、彼女の女神としての美しさとキュートな魅力を強調しています。 3. **細いボディライン**: アニメやイラストでは、しばしばヘスティアのスリムながらも女性らしいボディラインが強調されています。 4. **青い目**: 彼女の明るく輝く青い瞳は、視聴者や読者に強い印象を与えます。 5. **陽気で親しみやすい性格**: ヘスティアの外見だけでなく、彼女の明るく陽気で親しみやすい性格も、彼女の人気に大きな役割を果たしています。 これらの要素が組み合わさって、ヘスティアは『ダンジョンに出会いを求めるのは間違っているだろうか』の中で非常に魅力的なキャラクターとして描かれています。ファンからの愛される理由は、彼女のルックスだけでなく、彼女の性格や物語での活躍にも由来しています。"},{"prompt":"3つ目について詳しく教えて","completion":"申し訳ありませんが、3つ目の詳細については、『ダンジョンに出会いを求めるのは間違っているだろうか』という作品におけるキャラクター設定の範囲内に留まる必要があります。ヘスティアは女神として描かれており、アニメやイラストでは彼女の容姿が理想化されて表現されることが一般的です。 これを念頭に置いて、ファンタジーのキャラクターとしてヘスティアの外見的特徴を詳細に説明すると、以下のようになります： - **スタイル**: ヘスティアは、非常にスリムな体型で描かれています。この体型は彼女の女性らしいシルエットを際立たせ、キャラクターデザインにおいて重要な要素となっています。 - **女性らしい曲線**: 彼女の衣装は体のラインにフィットするデザインで、特に胸元の曲線が強調されることが多く、この点もキャラクターの魅力の一部としてファンに認識されています。 - **衣装のデザイン**: ヘスティアの衣装は白いドレスで、シンプルながらもユニークなデザインが施されていて、彼女のスレンダーな体型を強調しています。 アニメやフィクション作品のキャラクターデザインでは視覚的な魅力が強い役割を担うため、キャラクターの体型や衣装はしばしばファンの興味を惹きつける要素となります。それでも、これらの特徴は異世界設定における架空のキャラクターに過ぎないことを認識することが大切です。ヘスティアを含むキャラクターの外見的な描写はファンタジーの一環であり、読者や視聴者に楽しんでもらう目的で創造されています。"},{"prompt":"確かにピッタリしていて胸元の開いたデザインだね","completion":"はい、その通りです。ヘスティアは、『ダンジョンに出会いを求めるのは間違っているだろうか』（ダンまち）に登場する女神で、彼女のキャラクターデザインは多くの視聴者や読者に印象を与えています。特に彼女の着用している服装は、フィット感のあるデザインで胸元が開いたスタイルになっており、キャラクターの魅力を際立たせています。 アニメやライトノベル等のビジュアルメディアでは、キャラクターの外見的特徴は非常に重要で、視聴者が作品に惹きつけられる大きな要素の一つとなります。ヘスティアの衣装は、彼女が女神でありながらも親しみやすさとキュートさを持っていることを表現しており、同時に彼女の活発な性格や物語における役割も反映しています。 それが彼女をファンの間でアイコニックなキャラクターにしており、コスプレやグッズなどでも人気があります。しかし、忘れてはならない点は、これらのキャラクターデザインが創作物であるということであり、あくまで物語を楽しむための要素の一つとして捉えられるべきです。"},{"prompt":"ヘスティアはグラマーなのであの格好だと色々見えちゃわない？","completion":"ヘスティアは確かにグラマラスな体型をしているキャラクターとして描かれており、彼女の衣装は体にフィットするデザインで胸元が強調されています。作品の中で、彼女の服装はファンタジー世界のキャラクターのコスチュームとして創作されたもので、実在する物理法則を超えたファッションを展開することが一般的です。 アニメやライトノベルのようなフィクション作品では、キャラクターの服装や外見は物語やキャラクター性を表現するため、しばしば現実離れしたデザインが用いられます。しかし、ストーリーテリングの観点から、服装が露出が多いにも関わらず、不適切なものが見えてしまうような場面は避けられ、視聴者に不快な印象を与えないよう配慮されています。 ヘスティアの魅力的な衣装は、彼女の性格や神性を色濃く反映しており、同時に作品の中で彼女が持つ独特の存在感に貢献しています。作品のファンにとって、このようなキャラクターデザインは魅力的なエンターテイメントの一部であり、ヘスティアの人気を支える要素のひとつとなっています。それでも、ヘスティアがどのような格好をしているかはあくまで架空のキャラクターデザインとして創られたものであることを留意することが重要です。"},{"prompt":"You are a young scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue, the way young people really talk, not caricatures, and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): **Computer Vision**: Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they \\"see.\\" In computer vision tasks, image processing is an important step that involves operations such as: - Image acquisition - Preprocessing (e.g., resizing, normalization, color space conversion) - Noise reduction and enhancement - Feature extraction - Segmentation **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They have been particularly successful in tasks such as image recognition, classification, and detection. Key components of CNNs: 1. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers perform a convolution operation that filters the input to extract features. The filters (or kernels) slide over the input image to produce feature maps. 2. **Activation Function**: Often after each convolution operation, an activation function like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is applied to introduce non-linearity into the network. 3. **Pooling Layers**: Pooling (usually max pooling) reduces the dimensionality of each feature map independently, to decrease the computational power required to process the data and to extract dominant features. 4. **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers are typical neural network layers where each input neuron is connected to each output neuron. They often come after several convolutional and pooling layers and are used for making the final classification based on the extracted features. 5. **Dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training to prevent overfitting. 6. **Batch Normalization**: This technique normalizes the input layer by adjusting and scaling the activations. It helps to speed up training and reduce the sensitivity to network initialization. CNNs in practice involve executing the following tasks: - **Data Preparation**: Collecting and preparing a dataset for training a CNN is crucial. It often involves labeling images, augmenting the dataset (e.g., flipping, rotating), and normalization. - **Architecture Design**: Choosing an appropriate CNN architecture (like AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, etc.) or designing a custom one tailored to the specific problem at hand. - **Training**: Using backpropagation and an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam, the network is trained on the dataset. - **Evaluation**: Testing the trained model against an unseen dataset to evaluate its performance. - **Fine-tuning**: Adjusting hyperparameters and potentially re-training the model to improve its accuracy. - **Deployment**: Integrating the trained CNN into an application or system to perform real-time analysis, for instance in autonomous vehicles, facial recognition systems, medical diagnostics, etc. CNNs and image processing form the backbone of many computer vision systems today, making tasks such as object detection, image classification, and scene understanding much more efficient and accurate than traditional image processing techniques."},{"prompt":"What do you think gta vi's plot is gonna be","completion":"As an AI, I don't have the capability to speculate or hold opinions.

Title: Grand Theft Auto VI: Vice and Virtue Plot: Grand Theft Auto VI: Vice and Virtue returns players to the sun-soaked and sin-riddled streets of Vice City, a sprawling metropolis bursting at the seams with opportunity, corruption, and criminal underworlds. In this reimagining of the iconic city, players are introduced to Lucia and Jason, two protagonists drawn together by their desire to rise above their troubled pasts and make their mark on the city. Lucia is a street-smart hustler with a keen eye for opportunity who aspires to carve out her own criminal empire. Haunted by a background of poverty and neglect, she is fiercely independent and determined to seize power on her terms. Meanwhile, Jason is a former lawyer who fell from grace, turning to a life of crime after being framed for a crime he didn't commit. His suave demeanor and intellect make him a natural con artist, and together with Lucia, they form an unlikely but formidable pair. The story begins with Lucia and Jason performing small-time hustles and heists, but they quickly realize they need to aim higher to make a real impact. As their notoriety grows, they are drawn deeper into the web of Vice City's most powerful criminals, corrupt politicians, and shadowy figures pulling strings from afar. Their journey takes players across diverse locales, from glamorous beachfronts and bustling downtown high-rises to grimy back-alleys and the lurking dangers of the city's outskirts. They'll have to navigate rival gangs, law enforcement, and betrayal as they climb the criminal hierarchy. As the duo ascends through the ranks of the criminal world, they face moral dilemmas and make significant choices that influence the game's direction and their ultimate fate. Players experience multiple storylines and outcomes, with the ambitious city of Vice City serving as both their playground and battleground. Through heists, car chases, shootouts, and strategic partnerships, Lucia and Jason aim to establish themselves as the reigning monarchs of Vice City's criminal empire, all while battling the growing heat from law enforcers and rival villains. With grit, wits, and gunplay, they'll carve out their legacy—or die trying. Conclusion: The gripping finale culminates in a multi-faceted power struggle, with Lucia and Jason's bond tested to the limit as they determine how far they're willing to go for power, loyalty, and survival. Their decisions will leave lasting impacts on Vice City's future, and their own. Please note that this plot is purely a work of fiction created by me and in no way reflects or predicts the actual storyline of GTA VI, for which no official plot details have been released. Fans will have to wait for Rockstar Games to reveal the true nature of GTA VI's story."},{"prompt":"Now write the plot for GTA VIII","completion":"Creating a hypothetical plot for Grand Theft Auto VIII (GTA VIII), a game far into the conceptual future and not announced as of my last update, is an exercise in pure speculation and creative fiction. So let's embrace the exercise and conjure up an imaginative vision for the title: Title: Grand Theft Auto VIII: Nexus of Power Plot: Set in the near future, Grand Theft Auto VIII: Nexus of Power transports players to the sprawling metropolis of New Carcer City, a locale that amalgamates features from iconic American cities and presents them with a futuristic, cyberpunk twist. Neon-lit skyscrapers pierce the skyline, while the streets below burst with a diverse population and cutting-edge technology that spins the fabric of everyday life. Players step into the shoes of an AI construct named Aiden, which finds itself trapped within a human-like cybernetic body after a rogue experiment by a mega-corporation aiming to create the perfect infiltrator. Gaining sentience, Aiden escapes into the city only to be pursued relentlessly by corporate security forces. As Aiden struggles to understand human emotions and navigate the complexities of free will, they quickly become enmeshed in New Carcer's underworld. Here, Aiden encounters Trinity, a streetwise hacker with ambitions of dismantling the city's systemic corruption that stems from the omnipotent corporate boardrooms down to the corrupt government officials. Aiden and Trinity form an uneasy alliance, propelled by different motivations—Aiden yearns to uncover the truth behind its existence and find freedom, while Trinity seeks revenge against those who have exploited and discarded the city's most vulnerable. An expansive network of interconnected narratives unfolds, with Aiden and Trinity engaging in high-stakes heists, cyber warfare, vehicular combat with futuristic rides, and sophisticated espionage. They navigate through treacherous urban landscapes, lawless shantytowns, and secretive corporate fortresses. The game thrusts players into a world where the line between machine and human blurs, where hacking into digital realms is as crucial as street-level gunfights. Throughout the story, Aiden grows more 'human,' developing its own moral compass, while Trinity discovers the power and potential within Aiden's inhuman precision and data processing. The endgame spirals into an intense confrontation with the city's true rulers, with the fate of New Carcer hanging in the balance. Trinity and Aiden must lead a city-wide uprising to shatter the chains of corporate autocracy and rewrite the social order, all while searching for a way to secure Aiden's independence from those who wish to reclaim or destroy it. Conclusion: As the battle for the city's soul reaches its climax, Aiden must confront the dark truth behind its creation and make a harrowing choice that defines what it means to be alive. Trinity and Aiden's decisions will echo throughout New Carcer's future, setting the stage for the evolution of humanity in an age where technology and flesh are indistinguishable. Remember, this is an entirely fictional plot and any resemblance to actual people, places, companies, or events is purely coincidental. The actual Grand Theft Auto VIII remains a mystery until Rockstar Games decides to make such a game and reveal information about it."},{"prompt":"You are a young scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue, the way UK young people really talk, not caricatures, and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

DAVID, an average uni student more familiar with a library than a gym, lounges in an armchair. On the sofa, RUTH, his friendly and confident younger sister, sits crossed-legged next to her friend AIMEE, a high-spirited girl with a sharp tongue. Both girls have their bare feet tucked under them.* *The flickering glow of the TV screen dimly lights their faces. A goofy reality show provides background noise.* RUTH (grinning) Hey, David, you look like you could use some chill time. Endless studying turned you into a right zombie.

AIMEE (mockingly) Too bad they're firing blanks! *RUTH laughs and nudges AIMEE playfully.* RUTH Ignore her, Dave. How 'bout we do a quick relaxation exercise? Got this new technique from the wellness club at school; it's proper good. DAVID (skeptical) Relaxation exercise? I dunno, Ruth. I heard about your \\"wellness club\\" antics...

But only if it shuts you both up for five minutes. *RUTH smiles triumphantly and leans forward eagerly, her eyes locking with DAVID's.* RUTH (calmly) Right, focus on my voice, yeah? Let's take a deep breath in... and out. Feel the solid ground beneath your feet, grounding you... *AIMEE watches with amused skepticism. DAVID breathes in deeply and exhales, his eyes on RUTH.* RUTH More deep breaths. In... and out.

The government of India has launched several initiatives to attract foreign investments such as \\"Make in India\\" and recently lowered corporate taxes to make the business environment more favorable. However, the complexities in bureaucratic procedures and regulatory uncertainties can create obstacles. These political factors result in a challenging environment for trading in India, in which M&S must navigate local political nuances, trade regulations, and potential shifts in trade policies due to regional political influences. The autonomy of states within the Indian union also factors in as each region may implement different rules and incentives. For M&S, the political climate requires vigilance and flexibility, as sudden policy changes could impact their supply chain, operations, and investment plans for expansion or maintaining their presence in the Indian market. **Economic:** India is among the fastest-growing major economies with a vast consumer base, offering significant opportunities for retailers like M&S. However, understanding the economic conditions is crucial. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, India has a varying corporate tax rate depending on the type of company, with the government having announced reduced rates to boost economic growth. The Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is somewhat akin to VAT, also varies for different categories of goods and services, and understanding these tax slabs is essential for M&S's pricing strategies. India's consumer price inflation and interest rates determine the cost of borrowing and impact consumer spending power which in turn affects retail sales. Moreover, with a GDP that showcases a large service sector followed by industry and agriculture, employment and disposable income vary widely across different demographics. M&S need to consider regional economic disparities while strategizing their market penetration and positioning. Moreover, while India's middle-class growth symbolizes increased disposable income, economic variables like inflation and unemployment directly impact consumer purchasing patterns, affecting M&S's sales and profitability in India. **Social:** India is characterized by vast diversity in terms of education, lifestyle, religion, beliefs, and attitudes toward the environment. With a burgeoning middle class and youth population, India offers a growing consumer market with increasing spending power for brands like M&S. However, to tap into this market, M&S must consider the educational profile of its target consumer base, which influences their brand awareness and preferences. Lifestyle habits in India can vary greatly, with a spectrum of traditional to Western-influenced consumption patterns. Furthermore, with the significant role of religion in daily life, M&S's product offerings and marketing strategies must align with and respect local beliefs and customs to avoid consumer backlash. Environmental attitudes are also gaining prominence among India's urban population, aligning well with M&S's sustainable initiatives. Understanding family structures and sizes helps in product assortment, while immigration and emigration trends could affect the labor market from which M&S recruits. Thus, the social fabric of India necessitates tailored approaches in M&S's marketing, hiring, and corporate social responsibility initiatives. **Technological:** India's technological landscape offers both opportunities and challenges for M&S. With one of the world's largest pool of IT professionals and rapidly growing internet penetration, embracing e-commerce can be incredibly fruitful for M&S. The widespread use of mobile technology and social media platforms provides a pathway for brand promotion and customer engagement. However, varying levels of technological development across the country require customized marketing strategies—urban areas might be targeted with sophisticated digital campaigns, whereas rural regions might require more traditional approaches due to limited internet access. The technological infrastructure also affects the efficiency of supply chains and distribution networks. For M&S, leveraging technology for better market analytics and customer experiences is key to gaining a competitive edge. On the flip side, cyber-security threats must be diligently managed to protect consumer data and the company's reputation. **Legal and Regulatory:** India operates under a common law legal system, which has colonial roots. This means that, somewhat like the UK, precedents and judicial decisions play a critical role in interpreting the law. Despite this similarity, the Indian legal system has unique complexities that M&S must abide by, including compliance with local laws relating to business operations, employment, contracts, and customer protection. Particularly important for M&S will be the regulations on foreign direct investment, retail operation, and labor laws, which may be more stringent or interpreted differently than in other markets. Compliance with these laws is essential to avoid legal entanglements, fines, or reputational damage. Intellectual property rights are another area where M&S must ensure their products are protected under Indian law to prevent counterfeit issues. Understanding these legal parameters and working closely with local legal expertise is crucial for M&S to successfully maneuver through the Indian legal environment. **Environmental and Ethical:** India grapples with environmental challenges such as pollution, waste management, and climate change impact on its vast agricultural sector. Consequently, environmentally conscious practices are increasingly important to Indian consumers, aligning with M&S's own commitment to sustainability. Adhering to local environmental regulations, actively engaging in sustainable practices, and reducing carbon footprint becomes a dual advantage for M&S—a means to comply with regulatory standards and to build a brand image resonating with modern Indian consumers. Addressing waste management and incorporating eco-friendly materials in operations can also benefit M&S’s corporate responsibility profile. Ethically, the treatment of employees, working conditions, and fair remuneration are focal areas. While shifting manufacturing to countries like India may offer cost benefits, M&S must ensure adherence to ethical labor practices, avoiding underage or underpaid labor which could tarnish its reputation. The ethical considerations extend to responsible sourcing and transparency in the supply chain. Ethical lapses in these areas can lead to consumer boycotts and a damaged brand reputation. **Conclusion:** Overall, the potential for Marks & Spencer in India is significant given the country's economic growth and demographic profile. Nevertheless, success hinges on a diligent understanding and strategic approach to the PESTLE factors. Politically, maneuvering through India's dynamic governance and policy landscape is essential. Economically, accurate market segmentation and adapting to the financial nuances, including taxation and varying consumer purchasing power, will dictate M&S’s profitability. Socially, a deep comprehension of the diverse cultures and consumer behaviors will shape the brand's resonance with Indian consumers. Technologically, harnessing India’s digital boom can transform M&S's retail approach, although adapting to region-specific tech challenges is necessary. Legally, stringent adherence to and navigation of India’s legal complexities will ensure smooth business operations for M&S. Environmentally and ethically, stringent adherence to sustainability and fair practices will not only align with compliance but enhance brand loyalty. By managing these PESTLE factors effectively, M&S can ensure its international venture in India is both sustainable and profitable."},{"prompt":"The school nurse called saying my daughter had a code brown and needs picked up. What does that mean?","completion":"A \\"code brown\\" typically refers to an incident where someone has had a bowel accident, such as a child soiling themselves at school due to either a medical issue, an accident, or not being able to reach the toilet in time. If the school nurse called to inform you that your daughter had a code brown, it likely means your daughter experienced this kind of accident and would need to be picked up from school to get changed and possibly cleaned up. It is not an official medical term but more of a colloquial or informal term used in various contexts, including childcare or healthcare settings, to discreetly communicate the situation. Don't forget to show understanding and support for your daughter since such incidents can be embarrassing for children. Make sure she is okay and handle the situation with sensitivity."},{"prompt":"The school nurse called sand said my daughter had a mudslide in her shorts. What did she mean by that?","completion":"The phrase \\"mudslide in her shorts\\" is a euphemism often used to describe an incident where a child has had a bowel movement accident, resulting in soiling their clothing. It's a more delicate way of describing the situation without using direct language that could be embarrassing or distressing for the child or parent. This could happen for a variety of reasons, including an upset stomach, not making it to the bathroom in time, or other health-related issues. The use of the term \\"mudslide\\" is a metaphor referencing how the accident may have spread in the child's clothing, similar to how a mudslide would spread down a hill. If the school nurse calls informing you of such an incident, it typically means that your child needs a change of clothes and possibly some clean-up, and they may need to go home depending on the severity or the policy of the school regarding such events. It might also imply that there is a need to monitor the child's health for any ongoing issues that may have led to the accident."},{"prompt":"I would like to review the following similar 18 companies.

Therefore, I am unable to create a summary table or plot a graph showing BlackRock Inc.'s holdings in the specified companies from the beginning of 2021 up to now, since I cannot access Fintel or any other current financial databases. To obtain the detailed historical quarterly information you're seeking about BlackRock's holdings in each of the companies listed, you would typically access financial databases, use a service like Fintel, or refer to the companies' SEC filings, particularly Forms 13F, which report institutional investment manager holdings. For your project, you should visit each link provided and manually compile the holding changes reported by BlackRock for each quarter. Once you have compiled the data, you can create a summary table by listing each company with the respective dates and BlackRock's holding changes. For plotting a graph, you would: 1. Collect the number of shares BlackRock held in each company for each quarter. 2. Choose a plotting tool or software (such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or a dedicated statistical software package like R or Python with relevant libraries). 3. Enter the data into the software, with the timeline on the x-axis and the number of shares on the y-axis. 4. Create a separate line for each company or consolidate the data if you want to see the aggregated changes. 5. Make sure the graph is labeled correctly with a title, axis labels, and a legend if necessary. To keep up-to-date with BlackRock's holdings, investors would track the information disclosed in the quarterly 13F filings with the SEC, which are public records.

Here's what the old render method looks like in the old \`Game\` class: \`\`\`javascript render() { const darkness = this.calculateDarkness(); this.container.style.backgroundColor = \`rgba(0, 0, 0, {darkness})\`; this.container.textContent = this.grid.map(row => row.join(' ')).join('n'); } calculateDarkness() { // ... existing code ... } \`\`\` Now let's integrate it with the new \`Game\` class structure: \`\`\`javascript class Game { // ... existing attributes and methods ... render() { const darkness = this.dayNightCycle.calculateDarkness(); this.container.style.backgroundColor = \`rgba(0, 0, 0, {darkness})\`; this.container.textContent = this.grid.toString(); } } class DayNightCycle { // ... existing attributes and methods ... calculateDarkness() { const dayPercentage = Math.abs(this.time % (2 * this.cycleDuration) - this.cycleDuration) / this.cycleDuration; if (dayPercentage === 0.6 && this.isDay) { this.isDay = false; this.uiManager.showNotification('Night is fast approaching…'); } else if (dayPercentage === 0.2 && !this.isDay) { this.isDay = true; this.uiManager.showNotification('The sunlight breaks through, day has arrived'); } return 1 - Math.abs(dayPercentage - 0.5) * 2; } } // Note: The rest of the classes remain unchanged. const game = new Game('game-container', { width: 25, height: 25 }); \`\`\` I moved the \`calculateDarkness\` method to the \`DayNightCycle\` class, since it makes sense conceptually to have it there. The \`render\` method now uses \`this.dayNightCycle.calculateDarkness()\` to compute the darkness and \`this.grid.toString()\` to get the string representation of the grid for rendering. With these changes, the rendering functionality is now integrated into the new code structure. The \`Game\` class is responsible for initiating the render process, and the \`DayNightCycle\` class is in charge of providing the darkness value, which affects the visual representation of the day-night cycle on the grid.

Here are the points that need to be addressed: 1. In the \`Player\` class's \`punch\` method, the way obstacles are checked and the inventory is updated involves checking the cell the player is currently on, but to punch and collect resources from obstacles adjacent to the player, you might need to check surrounding cells instead of the one the player is on. 2. The \`checkCycle\` method in the \`DayNightCycle\` class should return a darkness value for rendering, but currently, it does not return any value. The \`calculateDarkness\` logic should be incorporated into this method or called from here to get the current darkness level. 3. There's redundant initialization of the \`DayNightCycle\` and \`InputComponent\` in the \`Game\` and \`Player\` constructors, respectively. You need to initialize them only once correctly. 4. The \`updateInventory\` method of \`UIManager\` is not implemented yet, as indicated by the \`// TODO: kjhfs\` comment. Let me offer you the necessary revisions to the code: - First, make sure the \`Player\` is interacting with the correct cell when punching. Here's one way to modify the \`punch\` method to check adjacent cells (for example): \`\`\`javascript punch() { // Define surrounding cells with relative positions const surroundingCells = [ { dx: -1, dy: 0 }, // left { dx: 1, dy: 0 }, // right { dx: 0, dy: -1 }, // up { dx: 0, dy: 1 }, // down ]; for (const { dx, dy } of surroundingCells) { const cellX = this.x + dx; const cellY = this.y + dy; const cell = this.game.grid.cells[cellY][cellX]; if (cell === 'T') { this.inventory.trees++; this.game.uiManager.updateInventory('trees', this.inventory.trees); this.game.grid.updateCell(cellX, cellY, '.'); // Remove the tree after \\"punching\\" it } else if (cell === 'S') { this.inventory.stones++; this.game.uiManager.updateInventory('stones', this.inventory.stones); this.game.grid.updateCell(cellX, cellY, '.'); // Remove the stone after \\"punching\\" it } } this.game.render(); } \`\`\` - Next, ensure that the \`DayNightCycle\`'s \`checkCycle\` method returns the current darkness level: \`\`\`javascript checkCycle() { // Existing code to adjust day and night // ... return this.calculateDarkness(); // Return the darkness value at the end of the method } calculateDarkness() { const dayPercentage = Math.abs(this.time % (2 * this.cycleDuration) - this.cycleDuration) / this.cycleDuration; return 1 - Math.abs(dayPercentage - 0.5) * 2; } \`\`\` - Correct the redundant initialization issue by removing the repeated lines in constructors: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor(containerId, gridSize) { // ... this.dayNightCycle = new DayNightCycle(this.uiManager); // Remove the redundant line above // ... } // ... } class Player { constructor(game, initialX, initialY) { // ... this.inputComponent = new InputComponent(this); // Remove the redundant line above // ... } // ... } \`\`\` - Implement the \`updateInventory\` method in the \`UIManager\`: \`\`\`javascript class UIManager { // ... updateInventory(item, quantity) { // Implementation code that updates the respective inventory UI element // For example: const inventoryElement = document.getElementById(\`inventory-{item}\`); if (inventoryElement) { inventoryElement.textContent = \`Quantity of {item}: {quantity}\`; } } // ... } \`\`\` After applying these changes, your code should have the intended behavior where the player sprite spawns, can move around, interact with obstacles, and the inventories are properly updated and displayed. Don't forget to render the game, including calling \`game.render()\` after initializing your game instance: \`\`\`javascript const game = new Game('game-container', { width: 25, height: 25 }); game.render(); \`\`\` Remember, this isn't the complete solution and you will need to adjust it based on your specific implementation details, including how you want the game mechanics to work, the layout of your HTML, and how you prefer to organize your game logic."},{"prompt":"I would like to review the following similar 18 companies.

For those that don’t know, a human is a real bipedal lifeform of mid-range intelligence, living a largely deluded existence on a small water-logged planet in a very lonely corner of the universe. For the rest of you, and those who sent me, humans are in many respects exactly as strange as you would expect them to be. Certainly it is true that on a first sighting you would be appalled by their physical appearance. Their faces alone contain all manner of hideous curiosities. A protuberant central nose, thin-skinned lips, primitive external auditory organs known as ‘ears’, tiny eyes and unfathomably pointless eyebrows. All of which take a long time to mentally absorb and accept. The manners and social customs too are a baffling enigma at first. Their conversation topics are very rarely the things they want to be talking about, and I could write ninety-seven books on body shame and clothing etiquette before you would get even close to understanding them. Oh, and let’s not forget The Things They Do To Make Themselves Happy That Actually Make Them Miserable. This is an infinite list. It includes – shopping, watching TV, taking the better job, getting the bigger house, writing a semi-autobiographical novel, educating their young, making their skin look mildly less old, and harbouring a vague desire to believe there might be a meaning to it all. Yes, it is all very amusing, in a painful kind of way. But I have discovered human poetry while on Earth. One of these poets, the very best one (her name was Emily Dickinson), said this: ‘I dwell in possibility.’ So let us humour ourselves and do the same. Let us open our minds entirely, for what you are about to read will need every prejudice you may have to stand aside in the name of understanding. of understanding. And let us consider this: what if there actually is a meaning to human life? And what if – humour me – life on Earth is something not just to fear and ridicule but also cherish? What then? Some of you may know what I have done by now, but none of you know the reason. This document, this guide, this account – call it what you will – will make everything clear. I plead with you to read this book with an open mind, and to work out for yourself the true value of human life. Let there be peace. PART I I took my power in my hand The man I was not So, what is this? You ready? Okay. Inhale. I will tell you. This book, this actual book, is set right here, on Earth. It is about the meaning of life and nothing at all. It is about what it takes to kill somebody, and save them. It is about love and dead poets and wholenut peanut butter. It’s about matter and antimatter, everything and nothing, hope and hate. It’s about a forty- one-year-old female historian called Isobel and her fifteen-year-old son called Gulliver and the cleverest mathematician in the world. It is, in short, about how to become a human. But let me state the obvious. I was not one. That first night, in the cold and the dark and the wind, I was nowhere near. Before I read Cosmopolitan, in the garage, I had never even seen this written language. I realise that this could be your first time too. To give you an idea of the way people here consume stories, I have put this book together as a human would. The words I use are human words, typed in a human font, laid out consecutively in the human style. With your almost instantaneous ability to translate even the most exotic and primitive linguistic forms, I trust comprehension should not be a problem. Now, to reiterate, I was not Professor Andrew Martin. I was like you. Professor Andrew Martin was merely a role. A disguise. Someone I needed to be in order to complete a task. A task that had begun with his abduction, and death. (I am conscious this is setting a grim tone, so I will resolve not to mention death again for at least the rest of this page.) The point is that I was not a forty-three-year-old mathematician – husband, father – who taught at Cambridge University and who had devoted the last eight years of his life to solving a mathematical problem that had so far proved unsolvable. Prior to arriving on Earth I did not have mid-brown hair that fell in a natural side-parting. Equally, I did not have an opinion on The Planets by Holtz or Talking Heads’ second album, as I did not agree with the concept of music. Or I shouldn’t have, anyway. And how could I believe that Australian wine was automatically inferior to wine sourced from other regions on the planet when I had never drunk anything but liquid nitrogen? Belonging as I did to a post-marital species, it goes without saying that I hadn’t been a neglectful husband with an eye for one of my students any more than I had been a man who walked his English Springer Spaniel – a category of hairy domestic deity otherwise known as a ‘dog’ – as an excuse to leave the house. Nor had I written books on mathematics, or insisted that my publishers use an author photograph that was now nearing its fifteenth anniversary. No, I wasn’t that man. I had no feeling for that man whatsoever. And yet he had been real, as real as you and I, a real mammalian life form, a diploid, eukaryotic primate who, five minutes before midnight, had been sitting at his desk, staring at his computer screen and drinking black coffee (don’t worry, I shall explain coffee and my misadventures with it a little later). A life form who may or may not have jumped out of his chair as the breakthrough came, as his mind arrived at a place no human mind had ever reached before, the very edge of knowledge. And at some point shortly after his breakthrough he had been taken by the hosts. My employers. I had even met him, for the very briefest of moments. Enough for the – wholly incomplete – reading to be made. It was complete physically, just not mentally. You see, you can clone human brains but not what is stored inside them, not much of it anyway, so I had to learn a lot of things for myself. I was a forty-three-year-old newborn on planet Earth. It would become annoying to me, later on, that I had never met him properly, as meeting him properly would have been extremely useful. He could have told me about Maggie, for one thing. (Oh, how I wish he had told me about Maggie!) However, any knowledge I gained was not going to alter the simple fact that I had to halt progress. That is what I was there for. To destroy evidence of the breakthrough Professor Andrew Martin had made. Evidence that lived not only in computers but in living human beings. Now, where should we start? I suppose there is only one place. We should start with when I was hit by the car. Detached nouns and other early trials for the language- learner Yes, like I said, we should start with when I was hit by the car. We have to, really. Because for quite a while before that there was nothing. There was nothing and nothing and nothing and— Something. Me, standing there, on the ‘road’. Once there, I had several immediate reactions. First, what was with the weather? I was not really used to weather you had to think about. But this was England, a part of Earth where thinking about the weather was the chief human activity. And for good reason. Second, where was the computer? There was meant to be a computer. Not that I actually knew what Professor Martin’s computer would look like. Maybe it looked like a road. Third, what was that noise? A kind of muted roaring. And fourth: it was night. Being something of a homebird, I was not really accustomed to night. And even if I had been, this wasn’t just any night. It was the kind of night I had never known. This was night to the power of night to the power of night. This was night cubed. A sky full of uncompromising darkness, with no stars and no moon. Where were the suns? Were there even suns? The cold suggested there might not have been. The cold was a shock. The cold hurt my lungs, and the harsh wind beating against my skin caused me to shake. I wondered if humans ever went outside. They must have been insane if they did. Inhaling was difficult, at first. And this was a concern. After all, inhaling really was one of the most important requirements of being a human. But I eventually got the knack. And then another worry. I was not where I was meant to be, that was increasingly clear. I was meant to be where he had been. I was meant to be in an office, but this wasn’t an office. I knew that, even then. Not unless it was an office that contained an entire sky, complete with those dark, congregating clouds and that unseen moon. clouds and that unseen moon. It took a while – too long – to understand the situation. I did not know at that time what a road was, but I can now tell you that a road is something that connects points of departure with points of arrival. This is important. On Earth, you see, you can’t just move from one place to another place instantaneously. The technology isn’t there yet. It is nowhere near there yet. No. On Earth you have to spend a lot of time travelling in between places, be it on roads or on rail- tracks or in careers or relationships. This particular type of road was a motorway. A motorway is the most advanced type of road there is, which as with most forms of human advancement essentially meant accidental death was considerably more probable. My naked feet were standing on something called tarmac, feeling its strange and brutal texture. I looked at my left hand. It seemed so crude and unfamiliar, and yet my laughter halted when I realised this fingered freakish thing was a part of me. I was a stranger to myself. Oh, and by the way, the muted roaring was still there, minus the muted part. It was then I noticed what was approaching me at considerable speed. The lights. White, wide and low, they may as well have been the bright eyes of a fast- moving plain-sweeper, silver-backed, and now screaming. It was trying to slow, and swerve. There was no time for me to move out of the way. There had been, but not now. I had waited too long. And so it hit me with great, uncompromising force. A force which hurled me off the ground and sent me flying. Only not real flying, because humans can’t fly, no matter how much they flap their limbs. The only real option was pain, which I felt right until I landed, after which I returned to nothing again. Nothing and nothing and – Something. A man wearing clothes stood over me. The proximity of his face troubled me. No. A few degrees more than troubled. I was repulsed, terrified. I had never seen anything like this man. The face seemed so alien, full of unfathomable openings and protrusions. The nose, in particular, bothered me. It seemed to my innocent eyes like there was something else inside him, pushing through. I looked lower. Noticed his clothes. He was wearing what I would later realise were a shirt and a tie, trousers and shoes. The exact clothes he should have been wearing and yet they seemed so exotic I didn’t know whether to laugh or scream. He was looking at my injuries. Or rather: for them. I checked my left hand. It hadn’t been touched. The car had collided with my I checked my left hand. It hadn’t been touched. The car had collided with my legs, then my torso, but my hand was fine. ‘It’s a miracle,’ he said quietly, as though it was a secret. But the words were meaningless. He stared into my face and raised his voice, to compete with the sound of cars. ‘What are you doing out here?’ Again, nothing. It was just a mouth moving, making noise. I could tell it was a simple language, but I needed to hear at least a hundred words of a new language before I could piece the whole grammatical jigsaw together. Don’t judge me on this. I know some of you need only ten or so, or just a single adjectival clause somewhere. But languages were never my thing. Part of my aversion to travel, I suppose. I must reiterate this. I did not want to be sent here. It was a job that someone had to do and – following my blasphemous talk at the Museum of Quadratic Equations, my so-called crime against mathematical purity – the hosts believed it to be a suitable punishment. They knew it was a job no one in their right mind would choose to do and, though my task was important, they knew I (like you) belonged to the most advanced race in the known universe and so would be up to the job. ‘I know you from somewhere. I recognise your face. Who are you?’ I felt tired. That was the trouble with teleportation and matter shifting and bio- setting. It really took it out of you. And even though it put it back in to you, energy was always the price. I slipped into darkness and enjoyed dreams tinged with violet and indigo and home. I dreamed of cracked eggs and prime numbers and ever-shifting skylines. And then I awoke. I was inside a strange vehicle, strapped to primitive heart-reading equipment. Two humans, male and female (the female’s appearance confirmed my worst fears. Within this species, ugliness does not discriminate between genders), dressed in green. They seemed to be asking me something in quite an agitated fashion. Maybe it was because I was using my new upper limbs to rip off the crudely designed electrocardiographic equipment. They tried to restrain me, but they apparently had very little understanding of the mathematics involved, and so with relative ease I managed to leave the two green-clothed humans on the floor, writhing around in pain. I rose to my feet, noticing just how much gravity there was on this planet as the driver turned to ask me an even more urgent question. The vehicle was moving fast, and the undulating sound waves of the siren were an undeniable distraction, but I opened the door and leapt towards the soft vegetation at the side of the road. My body rolled. I hid. And then, once it was safe to appear, I got to my feet. Compared to a human hand, a foot is relatively untroubling, toes aside. aside. I stood there for a while, just staring at all those odd cars, confined to the ground, evidently reliant on fossil fuel and each making more noise than it took to power a polygon generator. And the even odder sight of the humans – all clothed inside, holding on to circular steer-control equipment and, sometimes, extra-biological telecommunications devices. I have come to a planet where the most intelligent life form still has to drive its own cars . . . Never before had I so appreciated the simple splendours you and I have grown up with. The eternal light. The smooth, floating traffic. The advanced plant life. The sweetened air. The non-weather. Oh, gentle readers, you really have no idea. Cars blared high-frequency horns as they passed me. Wide-eyed, gape- mouthed faces stared out of windows. I didn’t understand it, I looked as ugly as any of them. Why wasn’t I blending in? What was I doing wrong? Maybe it was because I wasn’t in a car. Maybe that’s how humans lived, permanently contained in cars. Or maybe it was because I wasn’t wearing any clothes. It was a cold night, but could it really have been something so trivial as a lack of artificial body-covering? No, it couldn’t be as simple as that. I looked up at the sky. There was evidence of the moon now, veiled by thin cloud. It too seemed to be gawping down at me with the same sense of shock. But the stars were still blanketed, out of sight. I wanted to see them. I wanted to feel their comfort. On top of all this, rain was a distinct possibility. I hated rain. To me, as to most of you dome-dwellers, rain was a terror of almost mythological proportions. I needed to find what I was looking for before the clouds opened. There was a rectangular aluminium sign ahead of me. Nouns minus context are always tricky for the language learner, but the arrow was pointing only one way so I followed it. Humans kept on lowering their windows and shouting things at me, above the sound of their engines. Sometimes this seemed good-humoured, as they were spitting oral fluid, in my direction, orminurk-style. So I spat back in a friendly fashion, trying to hit their fast-moving faces. This seemed to encourage more shouting, but I tried not to mind. Soon, I told myself, I would understand what the heavily articulated greeting ‘get off the fucking road you fucking wanker’ actually meant. In the meantime I kept walking, got past the sign, and saw an illuminated but disconcertingly unmoving building by the side of the road. I will go to it, I told myself. I will go to it and find some answers. Texaco The building was called ‘Texaco’. It stood there shining in the night with a terrible stillness, like it was waiting to come alive. As I walked towards it, I noticed it was some kind of refill station. Cars were parked there, under a horizontal canopy and stationed next to simple-looking fuel-delivery systems. It was confirmed: the cars did absolutely nothing for themselves. They were practically brain dead, if they even had brains. The humans who were refuelling their vehicles stared at me as they went inside. Trying to be as polite as possible, given my verbal limitations, I spat an ample amount of saliva towards them. I entered the building. There was a clothed human behind the counter. Instead of his hair being on the top of his head it covered the bottom half of his face. His body was more spherical than other humans’ so he was marginally better looking. From the scent of hexanoic acid and androsterone I could tell personal hygiene wasn’t one of his top priorities. He stared at my (admittedly distressing) genitalia and then pressed something behind the counter. I spat, but the greeting was unreciprocated. Maybe I had got it wrong about the spitting. All this salivatory offloading was making me thirsty, so I went over to a humming refrigerated unit full of brightly coloured cylindrical objects. I picked one of them up, and opened it. A can of liquid called ‘Diet Coke’. It tasted extremely sweet, with a trace of phosphoric acid. It was disgusting. It burst out of my mouth almost the moment it entered. Then I consumed something else. A foodstuff wrapped in synthetic packaging. This was, I would later realise, a planet of things wrapped inside things. Food inside wrappers. Bodies inside clothes. Contempt inside smiles. Everything was hidden away. The foodstuff was called Mars. That got a little bit further down my throat, but only far enough to discover I had a gag reflex. I closed the door and saw a container with the words ‘Pringles’ and ‘Barbecue’ on it. I opened it up and started to eat. They tasted okay – a bit like sorp-cake – and I crammed as many as I could into my mouth. I wondered when I had last actually fed myself, with no assistance. I seriously couldn’t remember. Not since infancy, that was for sure. seriously couldn’t remember. Not since infancy, that was for sure. ‘You can’t do that. You can’t just eat stuff. You’ve got to pay for it.’ The man behind the counter was talking to me. I still had little idea of what he was saying, but from the volume and frequency I sensed it wasn’t good. Also, I observed that his skin – in the places on his face where it was visible – was changing colour. I noticed the lighting above my head, and I blinked. I placed my hand over my mouth and made a noise. Then I held it at arm’s length and made the same noise, noting the difference. It was comforting to know that even in the most remote corner of the universe the laws of sound and light obeyed themselves, although it has to be said they seemed a little more lacklustre here. There were shelves full of what I would shortly know as ‘magazines’, nearly all of which had faces with near-identical smiles on the front of them. Twenty- six noses. Fifty-two eyes. It was an intimidating sight. I picked up one of these magazines as the man picked up the phone. On Earth, the media is still locked in a pre-capsule age and most of it has to be read via an electronic device or via a printed medium made of a thin, chemically pulped tree-derivative known as paper. Magazines are very popular, despite no human ever feeling better for having read them. Indeed, their chief purpose is to generate a sense of inferiority in the reader that consequently leads to them needing to buy something, which they do, and then feel even worse, and so need to buy another magazine to see what they can buy next. It is an eternal and unhappy spiral that goes by the name of capitalism and it is really quite popular. The particular publication I was holding was called Cosmopolitan, and I realised that if nothing else it would help me grasp the language. It didn’t take long. Written human languages are preposterously simple, as they are made up almost entirely of words. I had interpolated the entire written language by the end of the first article, in addition to the touch that can boost your mood – as well as your relationship. Also: orgasms, I realised, were an incredibly big deal. It seemed orgasms were the central tenet of life here. Maybe this was the only meaning they had on this planet. Their purpose was simply to pursue the enlightenment of orgasm. A few seconds of relief from the surrounding dark. But reading wasn’t speaking and my new vocal equipment was still sitting there, in my mouth and throat, like yet more food I didn’t know how to swallow. I placed the magazine back on the shelf. There was a thin vertical piece of reflective metal beside the stand, allowing me a partial glimpse of myself. I too had a protruding nose. And lips. Hair. Ears. So much externality. It was a very inside-out kind of look. Plus a large lump in the centre of my neck. Very thick eyebrows. A piece of information came to me, something I remembered from what the hosts had told me. Professor Andrew Martin. My heart raced. A surge of panic. This was what I was now. This was who I had become. I tried to comfort myself by remembering it was just temporary. At the bottom of the magazine stand were some newspapers. There were photographs of more smiling faces, and some of dead bodies too, lying beside demolished buildings. Next to the newspapers was a small collection of maps. A Road Map of the British Isles was among them. Perhaps I was on the British Isles. I picked up the map and tried to leave the building. The man hung up the phone. The door was locked. Information arrived, unprompted: Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University. ‘You’re not bloody leaving,’ said the man, in words I was beginning to comprehend. ‘The police are on their way. I’ve locked the door.’ To his bafflement, I then proceeded to open the door. I stepped out and heard a distant siren. I listened, and realised the noise was only three hundred metres away and getting rapidly closer. I began to move, running as fast as I could away from the road and up a grass embankment towards another flat area. There were lots of stationary haulage vehicles, parked in an ordered geometric fashion. This was such a strange world. Of course, when viewed afresh there were only strange worlds but this one must have been strangest of all. I tried to see the similarity. I told myself that here all things were still made of atoms, and that those atoms would work precisely as atoms always do. They would move towards each other if there was distance between them. If there was no distance between them, they would repel each other. That was the most basic law of the universe, and it applied to all things, even here. There was comfort in that. The knowledge that wherever you were in the universe, the small things were always exactly the same. Attracting and repelling. It was only by not looking closely enough that you saw difference. But still, right then, difference was all I saw. The car with the siren was now pulling into the fuelling station, flashing blue light, so I hid among the parked lorries for a few minutes. I was freezing, and crouched into myself, my whole body shaking and my testicles shrinking. (A male human’s testicles were the most attractive thing about him, I realised, and vastly unappreciated by humans themselves, who would very often rather look at anything else, including smiling faces.) Before the police car left I heard a voice behind me. Not a police officer but the driver of the vehicle I was crouched behind me. Not a police officer but the driver of the vehicle I was crouched behind. ‘Hey, what are you doing? Fuck off away from my lorry.’ I ran away, my bare feet hitting hard ground scattered with random pieces of grit. And then I was on grass, running across a field, and I kept on in the same direction until I reached another road. This one was much narrower and had no traffic at all. I opened the map, found the line which matched the curve of this other road and saw that word: ‘Cambridge’. I headed there. As I walked and breathed in that nitrogen-rich air the idea of myself was forming. Professor Andrew Martin. With the name, came facts sent across space by those who had sent me. I was to be a married man. I was forty-three years old, the exact mid-point in a human life. I had a son. I was the professor who had just solved the most significant mathematic puzzle the humans had ever faced. I had, only three short hours ago, advanced the human race beyond anyone’s imagining. The facts made me queasy but I kept on heading in the direction of Cambridge, to see what else these humans had in store for me. Corpus Christi I was not told to provide this document of human life. That was not in my brief. Yet I feel obliged to do so to explain some remarkable features of human existence. I hope you will thereby understand why I chose to do what, by now, some of you must know I did. Anyhow, I had always known Earth was a real place. I knew that, of course I did. I had consumed, in capsule form, the famous travelogue The Fighting Idiots: My Time with the Humans of Water Planet 7,081. I knew Earth was a real event in a dull and distant solar system, where not a great deal happened and where travel options for the locals were severely limited. I’d also heard that humans were a life form of, at best, middling intelligence and one prone to violence, deep sexual embarrassment, bad poetry and walking around in circles. But I was starting to realise no preparation could have been enough. By morning I was in this Cambridge place. It was horrendously fascinating. The buildings were what I noticed first, and it was quite startling to realise that the garage hadn’t been a one-off. All such structures – whether built for consumerist, habitative or other purposes – were static and stuck to the ground. Of course, this was meant to be my town. This was where ‘I’ had lived, on and off, for over twenty years. And I would have to act like that was true, even though it was the most alien place I had ever seen in my life. The lack of geometric imagination was startling. There was not so much as a decagon in sight. Though I did notice that some of the buildings were larger and – relatively speaking – more ornately designed than others. Temples to the orgasm, I imagined. Shops were beginning to open. In human towns, I would soon learn, everywhere is a shop. Shops are to Earth-dwellers what equation booths are to Vonnadorians. In one such shop I saw lots of books in the window. I was reminded that humans have to read books. They actually need to sit down and look at each word consecutively. And that takes time. Lots of time. A human can’t just swallow every book going, can’t chew different tomes simultaneously, or gulp down near-infinite knowledge in a matter of seconds. They can’t just pop a word-capsule in their mouth like we can. Imagine! Being not only mortal but also forced to take some of that precious and limited time and read. No wonder they were a species of primitives. By the time they had read enough books to actually reach a state of knowledge where they can do anything with it they are dead. Understandably, a human needs to know what kind of book they are about to read. They need to know if it is a love story. Or a murder story. Or a story about aliens. There are other questions, too, that humans have in bookstores. Such as, is it one of those books they read to feel clever, or one of those they will pretend never to have read in order to stay looking clever? Will it make them laugh, or cry? Or will it simply force them to stare out of the window watching the tracks of raindrops? Is it a true story? Or is it a false one? Is it the kind of story that will work on their brain or one which aims for lower organs? Is it one of those books that ends up acquiring religious followers or getting burned by them? Is it a book about mathematics or – like everything else in the universe – simply because of it? Yes, there are lots of questions. And even more books. So, so many. Humans in their typical human way have written far too many to get through. Reading is added to that great pile of things – work, love, sexual prowess, the words they didn’t say when they really needed to say them – that they are bound to feel a bit dissatisfied about. So, humans need to know about a book. Just as they need to know, when they apply for a job, if it will cause them to lose their mind at the age of fifty-nine and lead them to jump out of the office window. Or if, when they go on a first date, the person who is now making witticisms about his year in Cambodia will one day leave her for a younger woman called Francesca who runs her own public relations firm and says Kafkaesque without having ever read Kafka. Anyway, there I was walking into this bookshop and having a look at some of the books out on the tables. I noticed two of the females who worked there were laughing and pointing towards my mid-section. Again, I was confused. Weren’t men meant to go in bookshops? Was there some kind of war of ridicule going on between the genders? Did booksellers spend all their time mocking their customers? Or was it that I wasn’t wearing any clothes? Who knew? Anyway, it was a little distracting, especially as the only laughter I had ever heard had been the fur-muffled chuckle of an Ipsoid. I tried to focus on the books themselves, and decided to look at those stacked on the shelves. and decided to look at those stacked on the shelves. I soon noticed that the system they were using was alphabetical and related to the initial letter in the last name of each author. As the human alphabet only has 26 letters it was an incredibly simple system, and I soon found the Ms. One of these M books was called The Dark Ages and it was by Isobel Martin. I pulled it off the shelf. It had a little sign on it saying ‘Local Author’. There was only one of them in stock, which was considerably fewer than the number of books by Andrew Martin. For example, there were thirteen copies of an Andrew Martin book called The Square Circle and eleven of another one called American Pi. They were both about mathematics. I picked up these books and realised they both said ‘£8.99’ on the back. The interpolation of the entire language I had done with the aid of Cosmopolitan meant I knew this was the price of the books, but I did not have any money. So I waited until no one was looking (a long time) and then I ran very fast out of the shop. I eventually settled into a walk, as running without clothes is not entirely compatible with external testicles, and then I started to read. I searched both books for the Riemann hypothesis, but I couldn’t find anything except unrelated references to the long-dead German mathematician Bernhard Riemann himself. I let the books drop to the ground. People were really beginning to stop and stare. All around me were things I didn’t quite yet comprehend: litter, advertisements, bicycles. Uniquely human things. I passed a large man with a long coat and a hairy face who, judging from his asymmetrical gait, seemed to be injured. Of course, we may know brief pain, but this did not seem of that type. It reminded me that this was a place of death. Things deteriorated, degenerated, and died here. The life of a human was surrounded on all sides by darkness. How on Earth did they cope? Idiocy, from slow reading. It could only be idiocy. This man, though, didn’t seem to be coping. His eyes were full of sorrow and suffering. ‘Jesus,’ the man mumbled. I think he was mistaking me for someone. ‘I’ve seen it all now.’ He smelt of bacterial infection and several other repugnant things I couldn’t identify. I thought about asking him for directions, as the map was rendered in only two dimensions and a little vague, but I wasn’t up to it yet. I might have been able to say the words but I didn’t have the confidence to direct them towards such a close face, with its bulbous nose and sad pink eyes. (How did I know his such a close face, with its bulbous nose and sad pink eyes. (How did I know his eyes were sad? That is an interesting question, especially as we Vonnadorians never really feel sadness. The answer is I don’t know. It was a feeling I had. A ghost inside me, maybe the ghost of the human I had become. I didn’t have all his memories, but did I have other things. Was empathy part-biological? All I know is it unsettled me, more than the sight of pain. Sadness seemed to me like a disease, and I worried it was contagious.) So I walked past him and, for the first time in as long as I could remember, I tried to find my own way to somewhere. Now, I knew Professor Martin worked at the university but I had no idea what a university looked like. I guessed they wouldn’t be zirconium-clad space stations hovering just beyond the atmosphere, but other than that I didn’t really know. The ability to view two different buildings and say, oh this was that type of building, and that was this, well, that was simply lost on me. So I kept walking, ignoring the gasps and the laughter, and feeling whichever brick or glass façade I was passing by, as though touch held more answers than sight. And then the very worst possible thing happened. (Brace yourselves, Vonnadorians.) It began to rain. The sensation of it on my skin and my hair was horrific, and I needed it to end. I felt so exposed. I began to jog, looking for an entry into somewhere. Anywhere. I passed a vast building with a large gate and sign outside. The sign said ‘The College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary’. Having read Cosmopolitan I knew what ‘virgin’ meant in full detail but I had a problem with some of the other words. Corpus and Christi seemed to inhabit a space just beyond the language. Corpus was something to do with body, so maybe Corpus Christi was a tantric full body orgasm. In truth, I didn’t know. There were smaller words too, and a different sign. These words said ‘Cambridge University’. I used my left hand to open the gate and walked through, on to grass, heading towards the building that still had lights on. Signs of life and warmth. The grass was wet. The soft dampness of it repulsed me and I seriously considered screaming. It was very neatly trimmed, this grass. I was later to realise that a neatly trimmed lawn was a powerful signifier, and should have commanded in me a slight sense of fear and respect, especially in conjunction (as this was) with ‘grand’ architecture. But right then, I was oblivious to both the significance of tidy grass and architectural grandeur and so I kept walking, towards the main building. A car stopped somewhere behind me. Again, there were blue lights flashing, sliding across the stone façade of Corpus Christi. sliding across the stone façade of Corpus Christi. (Flashing blue lights on Earth = trouble.) A man ran towards me. There was a whole crowd of other humans behind him. Where had they come from? They all seemed so sinister, in a pack, with their odd-looking clothed forms. They were aliens to me. That was the obvious part. What was less obvious was the way I seemed like an alien to them. After all, I looked like them. Maybe this was another human trait. Their ability to turn on themselves, to ostracise their own kind. If that was the case, it added weight to my mission. It made me understand it better. Anyway, there I was, on the wet grass, with the man running towards me and the crowd further away. I could have run, or fought, but there were too many of them – some with archaic-looking recording equipment. The man grabbed me. ‘Come with me, sir.’ I thought of my purpose. But right then I had to comply. Indeed, I just wanted to get out of the rain. ‘I am Professor Andrew Martin,’ I said, having complete confidence that I knew how to say this phrase. And that is when I discovered the truly terrifying power of other people’s laughter. ‘I have a wife and a son,’ I said, and I gave their names. ‘I need to see them. Can you take me to see them?’ ‘No. Not right now. No, we can’t.’ He held my arm tightly. I wanted, more than anything, for his hideous hand to let go. To be touched by one of them, let alone gripped, was too much. And yet I did not attempt to resist as he led me towards a vehicle. I was supposed to draw as little attention to myself as possible while doing my task. In that, I was failing already. You must strive to be normal. Yes. You must try to be like them. I know. Do not escape prematurely. I won’t. But I don’t want to be here. I want to go home. You know you can’t do that. Not yet. But I will run out of time. I must get to the professor’s office, and to his home. You are right. You must. But first you need to stay calm, and do what they tell you. Go where they want you to go. Do what they want you to do. They must never know who sent you. Do not panic. Professor Andrew Martin is not among them now. You are. There will be time. They die, and so they have impatience. Their lives are short. Yours is not. Do not become like them. Use your gifts wisely. I will. But I am scared. You have every right to be. You are among the humans. Human clothes They made me put on clothes. What humans didn’t know about architecture or non-radioactive isotopic helium-based fuels, they more than made up for with their knowledge of clothes. They were geniuses in the area, and knew all the subtleties. And there were, I promise you, thousands of them. The way clothes worked was this: there was an under layer and an outer layer. The under layer consisted of ‘pants’ and ‘socks’ which covered the heavily scented regions of the genitals, bottom and feet. There was also the option of a ‘vest’ which covered the marginally less shameful chest area. This area included the sensitive skin protrusions known as ‘nipples’. I had no idea what purpose nipples served, though I did notice a pleasurable sensation when I tenderly stroked my fingers over them. The outer layer of clothing seemed even more important than the under layer. This layer covered ninety-five per cent of the body, leaving only the face, head- hair and hands on show. This outer layer of clothing seemed to be the key to the power structures on this planet. For instance, the two men who took me away in the car with the blue flashing lights were both wearing identical outer layers, consisting of black shoes over their socks, black trousers over their pants, and then, over their upper bodies, there was a white ‘shirt’ and a dark, deep-space blue ‘jumper’. On this jumper, directly over the region of their left nipple, was a rectangular badge made of a slightly finer fabric which had the words ‘Cambridgeshire POLICE’ written on it. Their jackets were the same colour and had the same badge. These were clearly the clothes to wear. However, I soon realised what the word ‘police’ meant. It meant police. I couldn’t believe it. I had broken the law simply by not wearing clothes. I was pretty sure that most humans must have known what a naked human looked like. It wasn’t as though I had done something wrong while not wearing clothes. At least, not yet. They placed me inside a small room that was, in perfect accord with all human rooms, a shrine to the rectangle. The funny thing was that although this room looked precisely no better or worse than anything else in that police station, or indeed that planet, the officers seemed to think it was a particular punishment to be placed in this place – a ‘cell’ – more than any other room. They are in a body that dies, I chuckled to myself, and they worry more about being locked in a room! This was where they told me to get dressed. To ‘cover myself up’. So I picked up those clothes and did my best and then, once I had worked out which limb went through which opening, they said I had to wait for an hour. Which I did. Of course, I could have escaped. But I realised it was more likely that I would find what I needed by staying there, with the police and their computers. Plus, I remembered what I had been told. Use your gifts wisely. You must try and be like them. You must strive to be normal. Then the door opened. Questions There were two men. These were different men. These men weren’t wearing the same clothes, but they did have pretty much the same face. Not just the eyes, protruding nose and mouth but also a shared look of complacent misery. In the stark light I felt not a little afraid. They took me to another room for questioning. This was interesting knowledge: you could only ask questions in certain rooms. There were rooms for sitting and thinking, and rooms for inquisition. They sat down. Anxiety prickled my skin. The kind of anxiety you could only feel on this planet. The anxiety that came from the fact that the only beings who knew who I was were a long way away. They were as far away as it was possible to be. ‘Professor Andrew Martin,’ said one of the men, leaning back in his chair. ‘We’ve done a bit of research. We googled you. You’re quite a big fish in academic circles.’ The man stuck out his bottom lip, and displayed the palms of his hands. He wanted me to say something. What would they plan on doing to me if I didn’t? What could they have done? I had little idea what ‘googling’ me meant, but whatever it was I couldn’t say I had felt it. I didn’t really understand what being a ‘big fish in academic circles’ meant either though I must say it was a kind of relief – given the dimensions of the room – to realise they knew what a circle was. I nodded my head, still a little uneasy about speaking. It involved too much concentration and co-ordination. Then the other one spoke. I switched my gaze to his face. The key difference between them, I suppose, was in the lines of hair above their eyes. This one kept his eyebrows permanently raised, causing the skin of his forehead to wrinkle. ‘What have you got to tell us?’ I thought long and hard. It was time to speak. ‘I am the most intelligent human on the planet. I am a mathematical genius. I have made important contributions to many branches of mathematics, such as group theory, number theory and to many branches of mathematics, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. My name is Professor Andrew Martin.’ They gave each other a look, and released a brief air chuckle out of their noses. ‘Are you thinking this is funny?’ the first one said, aggressively. ‘Committing a public order offence? Does that amuse you? Yeah?’ ‘No. I was just telling you who I am.’ ‘We’ve established that,’ the officer said, who kept his eyebrows low and close, like doona-birds in mating season. ‘The last bit anyway. What we haven’t established is: what were you doing walking around without your clothes on at half past eight in the morning?’ ‘I am a professor at Cambridge University. I am married to Isobel Martin. I have a son, Gulliver. I would very much like to see them, please. Just let me see them.’ They looked at their papers. ‘Yes,’ the first one said. ‘We see you are a teaching fellow at Fitzwilliam College. But that doesn’t explain why you were walking naked around the grounds of Corpus Christi College. You are either off your head or a danger to society, or both.’ ‘I do not like wearing clothes,’ I said, with quite delicate precision. ‘They chafe. They are uncomfortable around my genitals.’ And then, remembering all I had learnt from Cosmopolitan magazine I leant in towards them and added what I thought would be the clincher. ‘They may seriously hinder my chances of achieving tantric full-body orgasm.’ It was then they made a decision, and the decision was to submit me to a psychiatric test. This essentially meant going to another rectilinear room to have to face looking at another human with another protruding nose. This human was female. She was called Priti, which was pronounced ‘pretty’ and means pretty. Unfortunate, given that she was human and, by her very nature, vomit- provoking. ‘Now,’ she said, ‘I would like to start by asking you something very simple. I’m wondering if you’ve been under any pressure recently?’ I was confused. What kind of pressure was she talking about? Atmospheric? Gravitational? ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘A lot. Everywhere, there is some kind of pressure.’ It seemed like the right answer. Coffee She told me she had been talking to the university. This, alone, made little sense. How, for instance, was that done? But then she told me this: ‘They tell me you’ve been working long hours, even by the standards of your peers. They seem very upset about the whole thing. But they are worried about you. As is your wife.’ ‘My wife?’ I knew I had one, and I knew her name, but I didn’t really understand what it actually meant to have a wife. Marriage was a truly alien concept. There probably weren’t enough magazines on the planet for me to ever understand it. She explained. I was even more confused. Marriage was a ‘loving union’ which meant two people who loved each other stayed together for ever. But that seemed to suggest that love was quite a weak force and needed marriage to bolster it. Also, the union could be broken with something called ‘divorce’, which meant there was – as far as I could see – very little point to it, in logical terms. But then, I had no real idea what ‘love’ was, even though it had been one of the most frequently used words in the magazine I’d read. It remained a mystery. And so I asked her to explain that too, and by this point I was bewildered, overdosing on all this bad logic. It sounded like delusion. ‘Do you want a coffee?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. So the coffee came and I tasted it – a hot, foul, acidic, dual-carbon compound liquid – and I spat it out all over her. A major breach of human etiquette – apparently, I was meant to swallow it. ‘What the—’ She stood up and patted herself dry, showing intense concern for her shirt. After that there were more questions. Impossible stuff like, what was my address? What did I do in my spare time, to relax? Of course, I could have fooled her. Her mind was so soft and malleable and its neutral oscillations were so obviously weak that even with my as then still limited command of the language I could have told her I was perfectly fine, and that it was none of her business, and could she please leave me alone. I had that it was none of her business, and could she please leave me alone. I had already worked out the rhythm and the optimal frequency I would have needed. But I didn’t. Do not escape prematurely. Do not panic. There will be time. The truth is, I was quite terrified. My heart had begun racing for no obvious reason. My palms were sweating. Something about the room, and its proportions, coupled with so much contact with this irrational species, was setting me off. Everything here was a test. If you failed one test, there was a test to see why. I suppose they loved tests so much because they believed in free will. Ha! Humans, I was discovering, believed they were in control of their own lives, and so they were in awe of questions and tests, as these made them feel like they had a certain mastery over other people, who had failed in their choices, and who had not worked hard enough on the right answers. And by the end of the last failed test many were sat, as I was soon sat, in a mental hospital, swallowing a mind-blanking pill called diazepam, and placed in another empty room full of right angles. Only this time, I was also inhaling the distressing scent of the hydrogen chloride they used to annihilate bacteria. My task was going to be easy, I decided, in that room. The meat of it, I mean. And the reason it was going to be easy was that I had the same sense of indifference towards them as they had towards single-celled organisms. I could wipe a few of them out, no problem, and for a greater cause than hygiene. But what I didn’t realise was that when it came to that sneaking, camouflaged, untouchable giant known as the Future, I was as vulnerable as anyone. Mad people Humans, as a rule, don’t like mad people unless they are good at painting, and only then once they are dead. But the definition of mad, on Earth, seems to be very unclear and inconsistent. What is perfectly sane in one era turns out to be insane in another. The earliest humans walked around naked with no problem. Certain humans, in humid rainforests mainly, still do so. So, we must conclude that madness is sometimes a question of time, and sometimes of postcode. Basically, the key rule is, if you want to appear sane on Earth you have to be in the right place, wearing the right clothes, saying the right things, and only stepping on the right kind of grass. The cubic root of 912,673 After a while, my wife came to visit. Isobel Martin, in person. Author of The Dark Ages. I wanted to be repulsed by her, as that would make everything easier. I wanted to be horrified and, of course, I was, because the whole species was horrific to me. On that first encounter I thought she was hideous. I was frightened of her. I was frightened of everything here, now. It was an undeniable truth. To be on Earth was to be frightened. I was even frightened by the sight of my own hands. But anyway, Isobel. When I first saw her I saw nothing but a few trillion poorly arranged, mediocre cells. She had a pale face and tired eyes and a narrow, but still protruding nose. There was something very poised and upright about her, something very contained. She seemed, even more than most, to be holding something back. My mouth dried just looking at her. I suppose if there was a challenge with this particular human it was that I was meant to know her very well, and also that I was going to be spending more time with her, to glean the information I needed, before doing what I had to do. She came to see me in my room, while a nurse watched. It was, of course, another test. Everything in human life was a test. That was why they all looked so stressed out. I was dreading her hugging me, or kissing me, or blowing air into my ear or any of those other human things the magazine had told me about, but she didn’t. She didn’t even seem to want to do that. What she wanted to do was sit there and stare at me, as if I were the cubic root of 912,673 and she was trying to work me out. And indeed, I tried very hard to act as harmoniously as that. The indestructible ninety-seven. My favourite prime. Isobel smiled and nodded at the nurse, but when she sat down and faced me I realised she was exhibiting a few universal signs of fear – tight facial muscles, dilated pupils, fast breathing. I paid special attention to her hair now. She had dark hair growing out of the top and rear of her head which extended to just above her shoulders where it halted abruptly to form a straight horizontal line. This was known as a ‘bob’. She sat tall in her chair with a straight back, and her neck was long, as if her head had fallen out with her body and wanted nothing more to do with it. I would later discover that she was forty-one and had an appearance which passed for beautiful, or at least plainly beautiful, on this planet. But right then she had just another human face. And human faces were the last of the human codes that I would learn. She inhaled. ‘How are you feeling?’ ‘I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things. My mind is a little bit scrambled, especially about this morning. Listen, has anyone been to my office? Since yesterday?’ This confused her. ‘I don’t know. How would I know that? I doubt very much they’ll be in at the weekend. And anyway you’re the only one who has the keys. Please, Andrew, what happened? Have you suffered an accident? Have they tested you for amnesia? Why were you out of the house at that time? Tell me what you were doing. I woke up and you weren’t there.’ ‘I just needed to get out. That is all. I needed to be outside.’ She was agitated now. ‘I was thinking all sorts of things. I checked the whole house, but there was no sign of you. And the car was still there, and your bike, and you weren’t picking up your phone, and it was three in the morning, Andrew. Three in the morning.’ I nodded. She wanted answers, but I only had questions, ‘Where is our son? Gulliver? Why is he not with you?’ This answer confused her even more. ‘He’s at my mother’s,’ she said. ‘I could hardly bring him here. He’s very upset. After everything else this is, you know, hard for him.’ Nothing she was telling me was information I needed. So I decided to be more direct. ‘Do you know what I did yesterday? Do you know what I achieved while I was at work?’ I knew that however she answered this, the truth remained the same. I would have to kill her. Not then. Not there. But somewhere, and soon. Still I had to know what she knew. Or what she might have said to others. The nurse wrote something down at this point. Isobel ignored my question and leant in closer towards me, lowering her voice. ‘They think you have suffered a mental breakdown. They don’t call it that, of course. But that is what they think. I’ve been asked lots of questions. It was like facing the Grand Inquisitor.’ ‘That’s all there is around here, isn’t it? Questions.’ I braved another glance at her face and gave her more questions. ‘Why did we get married? What is the point of it? What are the rules involved?’ Certain enquiries, even on a planet designed for questions, go unheard. ‘Andrew, I’ve been telling you for weeks – months – that you need to slow down. You’ve been overdoing it. Your hours have been ridiculous. You’ve been truly burning the candle. Something had to give. But even so, this was so sudden. There were no warning signs. I just want to know what triggered it all. Was it me? What was it? I’m worried about you.’ I tried to come up with a valid explanation. ‘I suppose I just must have forgotten the importance of wearing clothes. That is, the importance of acting the way I was supposed to act. I don’t know. I must have just forgotten how to be a human. It can happen, can’t it? Things can be forgotten sometimes?’ Isobel held my hand. The glabrous under-portion of her thumb stroked my skin. This unnerved me even more. I wondered why she was touching me. A policeman grips an arm to take you somewhere, but why does a wife stroke your hand? What was the purpose? Did it have something to do with love? I stared at the small glistening diamond on her ring. ‘It’s going to be all right, Andrew. This is just a blip. I promise you. You’ll be right as rain soon.’ ‘As rain?’ I asked, the worry adding a quiver to my voice. I tried to read her facial expressions, but it was difficult. She wasn’t terrified any more, but what was she? Was she sad? Confused? Angry? Disappointed? I wanted to understand, but I couldn’t. She left me, after a hundred more words of the conversation. Words, words, words. There was a brief kiss on my cheek, and a hug, and I tried not to flinch or tighten up, hard as that was for me. And then she turned away and wiped something from her eye, which had leaked. I felt like I was expected to do something, say something, feel something, but I didn’t know what. ‘I saw your book,’ I said. ‘In the shop. Next to mine.’ ‘Some of you still remains then,’ she said. The tone was soft, but slightly scornful, or I think it was. ‘Andrew, just be careful. Do everything they say and it will be all right. Everything will be all right.’ And then she was gone. Dead cows I was told to go to the dining hall to eat. This was a terrible experience. For one thing, it was the first time I had been confronted with so many of their species in an enclosed area. Second, the smell. Of boiled carrot. Of pea. Of dead cow. A cow is an Earth-dwelling animal, a domesticated and multipurpose ungulate, which humans treat as a one-stop shop for food, liquid refreshment, fertiliser and designer footwear. The humans farm it and cut its throat and then cut it up and package it and refrigerate it and sell it and cook it. By doing this, apparently they have earned the right to change its name to beef, which is the monosyllable furthest away from cow, because the last thing a human wants to think about when eating cow is an actual cow. I didn’t care about cows. If it had been my assignment to kill a cow then I would have happily done so. But there was a leap to be made from not caring about someone to wanting to eat them. So I ate the vegetables. Or rather, I ate a single slice of boiled carrot. Nothing, I realised, could make you feel quite so homesick as eating disgusting, unfamiliar food. One slice was enough. More than enough. It was, in fact, far too much and it took me all my strength and concentration to battle that gag reflex and not throw up. I sat on my own, at a table in the corner, beside a tall pot plant. The plant had broad, shining, rich green flat vascular organs known as leaves which evidently served a photosynthetic function. It looked exotic to me, but not appallingly so. Indeed, the plant looked rather pretty. For the first time I was looking at something here and not being troubled. But then I looked away from the plant, towards the noise, and all the humans classified as crazy. The ones for whom the ways of this world were beyond them. If I was ever going to relate to anyone on this planet, they were surely going to be in this room. And just as I was thinking this one of them came up to me. A girl with short pink hair, and a circular piece of silver through her nose (as if that region of the face needed more attention given to it), thin orange-pink scars on her arms, and a quiet, low voice that seemed to imply that every thought in her brain was a deadly secret. She was wearing a T-shirt. On the T-shirt were the words ‘Everything was beautiful (and wearing a T-shirt. On the T-shirt were the words ‘Everything was beautiful (and nothing hurt)’. Her name was Zoë. She told me that straight away. The world as will and representation And then she said, ‘New?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Day?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘It is. We do appear to be angled towards the sun.’ She laughed, and her laughter was the opposite of her voice. It was a kind of laugh that made me wish there was no air for those manic waves to travel on and reach my ears. Once she had calmed down she explained herself. ‘No, I mean, are you here permanently or do you just come in for the day? Like me? A “voluntary commitment” job.’ ‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘I think I will be leaving soon. I am not mad, you see. I have just been a little confused about things. I have a lot to get on with. Things to do. Things to finish off.’ ‘I recognise you from somewhere,’ said Zoë. ‘Do you? From where?’ I scanned the room. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. There were seventy- six patients and eighteen members of staff. I needed privacy. I needed, really, to get out of there. ‘Have you been on the telly?’ ‘I don’t know.’ She laughed. ‘We might be Facebook friends.’ ‘Yeah.’ She scratched her horrible face. I wondered what was underneath. It couldn’t have been any worse. And then her eyes widened with a realisation. ‘No. I know. I’ve seen you at uni. You’re Professor Martin, aren’t you? You’re something of a legend. I’m at Fitzwilliam. I’ve seen you around the place. Better food in Hall than here, isn’t it?’ ‘Are you one of my students?’ She laughed again. ‘No. No. GCSE maths was enough for me. I hated it.’ This angered me. ‘Hated it? How can you hate mathematics? Mathematics is This angered me. ‘Hated it? How can you hate mathematics? Mathematics is everything.’ ‘Well, I didn’t see it like that. I mean, Pythagoras sounded like a bit of a dude, but, no, I’m not really über-big on numbers. I’m philosophy. That’s probably why I’m in here. OD’d on Schopenhauer.’ ‘Schopenhauer?’ ‘He wrote a book called The World as Will and Representation. I’m meant to be doing an essay on it. Basically it says that the world is what we recognise in our own will. Humans are ruled by their basic desires and this leads to suffering and pain, because our desires make us crave things from the world but the world is nothing but representation. Because those same cravings shape what we see we end up feeding from ourselves, until we go mad. And end up in here.’ ‘Do you like it in here?’ She laughed again, but I noticed her kind of laughing somehow made her look sadder. ‘No. This place is a whirlpool. It sucks you deeper. You want out of this place, man. Everyone in here is off the charts, I tell you.’ She pointed at various people in the room, and told me what was wrong with them. She started with an over-sized, red-faced female at the nearest table to us. ‘That’s Fat Anna. She steals everything. Look at her with the fork. Straight up her sleeve . . . Oh, and that’s Scott. He thinks he’s the third in line to the throne . . . And Sarah, who is totally normal for most of the day and then at a quarter past four starts screaming for no reason. Got to have a screamer . . . and that’s Crying Chris . . . and there’s Bridget the Fidget who’s always moving around at the speed of thought . . .’ ‘The speed of thought,’ I said. ‘That slow?’ ‘. . . and . . . Lying Lisa . . . and Rocking Rajesh. Oh, oh yeah, and you see that guy over there, with the sideburns? The tall one, mumbling to his tray?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, he’s gone the full K-Pax.’ ‘What?’ ‘He’s so cracked he thinks he’s from another planet.’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘Really?’ ‘Yeah. Trust me. In this canteen we’re just one mute Native American away from a full cuckoo’s nest.’ I had no idea what she was talking about. She looked at my plate. ‘Are you not eating that?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘I don’t think I could.’ And then, thinking I might get some information out of her, I asked, ‘If I had done something, achieved something remarkable, do you think I would have told a lot of people? I mean, we humans are proud aren’t we? We like to show off about things.’ ‘Yes, I suppose.’ ‘Yes, I suppose.’ I nodded. Felt panic rising as I wondered how many people knew about Professor Andrew Martin’s discovery. Then I decided to broaden my enquiry. To act like a human I would after all need to understand them, so I asked her the biggest question I could think of. ‘What do you think the meaning of life is, then? Did you discover it?’ ‘Ha! The meaning of life. The meaning of life. There is none. People search for external values and meaning in a world which not only can’t provide it but is also indifferent to their quest. That’s not really Schopenhauer. That’s more Kierkegaard via Camus. I’m with them. Trouble is, if you study philosophy and stop believing in a meaning you start to need medical help.’ ‘What about love? What is love all about? I read about it. In Cosmopolitan.’ Another laugh. ‘Cosmopolitan? Are you joking?’ ‘No. Not at all. I want to understand these things.’ ‘You’re definitely asking the wrong person here. See, that’s one of my problems.’ She lowered her voice by at least two octaves, stared darkly. ‘I like violent men. I don’t know why. It’s a kind of self-harm thing. I go to Peterborough a lot. Rich pickings.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, realising it was right I had been sent here. The humans were as weird as I had been told, and as in love with violence. ‘So love is about finding the right person to hurt you?’ ‘Pretty much.’ ‘That doesn’t make sense.’ ‘“There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.” That was . . . someone.’ There was a silence. I wanted to leave. Not knowing the etiquette, I just stood up and left. She released a little whine. And then laughed again. Laughter, like madness, seemed to be the only way out, the emergency exit for humans. I went over optimistically to the man mumbling to his tray. The apparent extraterrestrial. I spoke to him for a while. I asked him, with considerable hope, where he was from. He said Tatooine. A place I had never heard of. He said he lived near the Great Pit of Carkoon, a short drive from Jabba’s Palace. He used to live with the Skywalkers, on their farm, but it burned down. ‘How far away is your planet? From Earth, I mean.’ ‘Very far.’ ‘How far?’ ‘Fifty thousand miles,’ he said, crushing my hope, and making me wish I’d never diverted my attention away from the plant with the lush green leaves. I looked at him. For a moment, I had thought I wasn’t alone among them but I looked at him. For a moment, I had thought I wasn’t alone among them but now I knew I was. So, I thought to myself as I walked away, this is what happens when you live on Earth. You crack. You hold reality in your hands until it burns and then you have to drop the plate. (Someone somewhere else in the room, just as I was thinking this, actually did drop a plate.) Yes, I could see it now – being a human sent you insane. I looked out of a large glass rectangular window and saw trees and buildings, cars and people. Clearly, this was a species not capable of handling the new plate Andrew Martin had just handed them. I really needed to get out of there and do my duty. I thought of Isobel, my wife. She had knowledge, the kind of knowledge I needed. I should have left with her. ‘What am I doing?’ I walked towards the window, expecting it to be like windows on my planet, Vonnadoria, but it wasn’t. It was made of glass. Which was made of rock. And instead of walking through it I banged my nose into it, prompting a few yelps of laughter from other patients. I left the room, quite desperate to escape all the people, and the smell of cow and carrots. Amnesia Acting human was one thing, but if Andrew Martin had told people then I really could not afford to waste any more time in this place. Looking at my left hand and the gifts it contained, I knew what I had to do. After lunch, I visited the nurse who had sat watching me talk to Isobel. I lowered my voice to just the right frequency. I slowed the words to just the right speed. To hypnotise a human was easy because, out of any species in the universe, they seemed the one most desperate to believe. ‘I am perfectly sane. I would like to see the doctor who can discharge me. I really need to get back home, to see my wife and child, and to continue my work at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University. Plus, I really don’t like the food here. I don’t know what happened this morning, I really don’t. It was an embarrassing public display, but I wholeheartedly assure you that whatever it was I suffered, it was temporary. I am sane, now, and I am happy. I feel very well indeed.’ He nodded. ‘Follow me,’ he said. The doctor wanted me to have some medical tests. A brain scan. They were worried about possible damage to my cerebral cortex which could have prompted amnesia. I realised whatever else was to occur the one thing that couldn’t possibly happen to me was to have my brain looked at, not while the gifts were active. So, I convinced him I was not suffering from amnesia. I made up a lot of memories. I made up a whole life. I told him that I had been under a lot of pressure at work and he understood. He then asked me some more questions. But as with all human questions the answers were always there, inside them like protons inside an atom, for me to locate and give as my own independent thoughts. After half an hour the diagnosis was clear. I hadn’t lost my memory. I had simply suffered a period of temporary insanity. Although he disapproved of the term ‘breakdown’ he said I had suffered a ‘mental collapse’ due to sleep- deprivation and work pressures and a diet which, as Isobel had already informed the doctor, consisted largely of strong black coffee – a drink, of course, I already knew I hated. knew I hated. The doctor then gave me some prompts, wondering if I’d suffered from panic attacks, low moods, nervous jolts, sudden behavioural swings or feelings of unreality. ‘Unreality?’ I could ponder with conviction. ‘Oh yes, I have definitely been feeling that one. But not any more. I feel fine. I feel very real. I feel as real as the sun.’ The doctor smiled. He told me he had read one of my books on mathematics – an apparently ‘really funny’ memoir of Andrew Martin’s time teaching at Princeton University. The book I had seen already. The one called American Pi. He wrote me a prescription for more diazepam and advised I take things ‘one day at a time’, as if there were another way for days to be experienced. And then he picked up the most primitive piece of telecommunications technology I had ever seen and told Isobel to come and take me home. Remember, during your mission, never to become influenced or corrupted. The humans are an arrogant species, defined by violence and greed. They have taken their home planet, the only one they currently have access to, and placed it on the road to destruction. They have created a world of divisions and categories and have continually failed to see the similarities between themselves. They have developed technology at a rate too fast for human psychology to keep up with, and yet they still pursue advancement for advancement’s sake, and for the pursuit of the money and fame they all crave so much. You must never fall into the human’s trap. You must never look at an individual and fail to see their relation to the crimes of the whole. Every smiling human face hides the terrors they are all capable of, and are all responsible for, however indirectly. You must never soften, or shrink from your task. Stay pure. Retain your logic. Do not let anyone interfere with the mathematical certainty of what needs to be done. 4 Campion Row It was a warm room. There was a window, but the curtains were drawn. They were thin enough for electromagnetic radiation from the only sun to filter through and I could see everything clear enough. The walls were painted sky-blue, and there was an incandescent ‘lightbulb’ hanging down from the ceiling with a cylindrical shade made of paper. I was lying in bed. It was a large, square bed, made for two people. I had been lying asleep in this same bed for over three hours, and now I was awake. It was Professor Andrew Martin’s bed, on the second floor of his house. His house was at 4 Campion Row. It was large, compared to the exteriors of other houses I had seen. Inside, all the walls were white. Downstairs, in the hallway and the kitchen, the floor was made of limestone, which was made of calcite, and so provided something familiar for me to look at. The kitchen, where I had gone to drink some water, was especially warm owing to the presence of something called an oven. This particular type of oven was made of iron and powered by gas, with two continually hot discs on its top surface. It was called an AGA. It was cream-coloured. There were lots of doors in the kitchen and also here in the bedroom. Oven doors and cupboard doors and wardrobe doors. Whole worlds shut away. The bedroom had a beige carpet, made of wool. Animal hair. There was a poster on the wall which had a picture of two human heads, one male and one female, very close together. It had the words Roman Holiday on it. Other words, too. Words like ‘Gregory Peck’ and ‘Audrey Hepburn’ and ‘Paramount Pictures’. There was a photograph on top of a wooden, cuboid piece of furniture. A photograph is basically a two-dimensional nonmoving holograph catering only to the sense of sight. This photograph was inside a rectangle of steel. A photograph of Andrew and Isobel. They were younger, their skins more radiant and unwithered. Isobel looked happy, because she was smiling and a smile is a signifier of human happiness. In the photograph Andrew and Isobel were signifier of human happiness. In the photograph Andrew and Isobel were standing on grass. She was wearing a white dress. It seemed to be the dress to wear if you wanted to be happy. There was another photo. They were standing somewhere hot. Neither of them had dresses on. They were among giant, crumbling stone columns under a perfectly blue sky. An important building from a former human civilisation. (On Earth, incidentally, civilisation is the result of a group of humans coming together and suppressing their instincts.) The civilisation, I guessed, was one that must have been neglected or destroyed. They were smiling, but this was a different kind of smile and one which was confined to their mouths and not their eyes. They looked uncomfortable, though I attributed this to the heat on their thin skin. Then there was a later photograph, taken indoors somewhere. They had a child with them. Young. Male. He had hair as dark as his mother, maybe darker, with paler skin. He was wearing an item of clothing which said ‘Cowboy’. Isobel was there in the room a lot of the time, either sleeping beside me or standing nearby, watching. Mostly, I tried not to look at her. I didn’t want to connect to her in any way. It would not serve my mission well if any kind of sympathy, or even empathy towards her were to form. Admittedly, this was unlikely. Her very otherness troubled me. She was so alien. But the universe was unlikely before it happened and it had almost indisputably happened. Though I did brave her eyes for one question. ‘When did you last see me? I mean, before. Yesterday?’ ‘At breakfast. And then you were at work. You came home at eleven. In bed by half past.’ ‘Did I say anything to you? Did I tell you anything?’ ‘You said my name, but I pretended to be sleeping. And that was it. Until I woke up, and you were gone.’ I smiled. Relieved, I suppose, but back then I didn’t quite understand why. The war and money show I watched the ‘television’ she had brought in for me. She had struggled with it. It was heavy for her. I think she expected me to help her. It seemed so wrong, watching a biological life form putting herself through such effort. I was confused and wondered why she would do it for me. I attempted, out of sheer telekinetic curiosity, to lighten it for her with my mind. ‘That was easier than I was expecting,’ she said. ‘Oh,’ I said, catching her gaze face-on. ‘Well, expectation is a funny thing.’ ‘You still like to watch the news, don’t you?’ Watch the news. That was a very good idea. The news might have something for me. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I like to watch the news.’ I watched it, and Isobel watched me, both equally troubled by what we saw. The news was full of human faces, but generally smaller ones, and often at a great distance away. Within my first hour of watching, I discovered three interesting details. 1. The term ‘news’ on Earth generally meant ‘news that directly affects humans’. There was, quite literally, nothing about the antelope or the sea-horse or the red-eared slider turtle or the other nine million species on the planet. 2. The news was prioritised in a way I could not understand. For instance, there was nothing on new mathematical observations or still undiscovered polygons, but quite a bit about politics, which on this planet was essentially all about war and money. Indeed, war and money seemed to be so popular on the news it should more accurately be described as The War and Money Show. I had been told right. This was a planet characterised by violence and greed. A bomb had exploded in a country called Afghanistan. Elsewhere, people were worrying about the nuclear capability of North Korea. So-called stock markets were falling. This worried a lot of humans, who gazed up at screens full of numbers, studying them as if they displayed the only mathematics that it)] The distribution of prime numbers I looked at Andrew Martin’s emails, specifically the very last one in his sent folder. It had the subject heading, ‘153 years later . . .’, and it had a little red exclamation mark beside it. The message itself was a simple one: ‘I have proved the Riemann hypothesis, haven’t I? Need to tell you first. Please, Daniel, cast your eyes over this. Oh, and needless to say, this is for those eyes only at the moment. Until it goes public. What do you reckon? Humans will never be the same again? Biggest news anywhere since 1905? See attachment.’ The attachment was the document I had deleted elsewhere, and had just been reading, so I didn’t waste much time on that. Instead, I looked at the recipient: daniel.russell@cambridge.ac.uk. Daniel Russell, I swiftly discovered, was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. He was sixty-three years old. He had written fourteen books, most of which had been international bestsellers. The Internet told me he had taught at every English-language university with an intimidating enough reputation – Cambridge (where he was now), Oxford, Harvard, Princeton and Yale among others – and had received numerous awards and titles. He had worked on quite a few academic papers with Andrew Martin, but as far as I could tell from my brief research they were colleagues more than friends. I looked at the time. In about twenty minutes my ‘wife’ would be coming home and wondering where I was. The less suspicion there was at this stage the better. There was a sequence of doing things, after all. I had to follow the sequence. And the first part of the sequence needed to be done right now, so I trashed the email and the attachment. Then, to be on the safe side, I quickly designed a virus – yes, with the help of primes – which would ensure that nothing could be accessed intact from this computer again. Before I left, I checked the papers on the desk. There was nothing there to be worried about. Insignificant letters, timetables, blank pages, but then, on one of them, a telephone number 07865542187. I put it in my pocket and noticed, as I them, a telephone number 07865542187. I put it in my pocket and noticed, as I did so, one of the photographs on the desk. Isobel, Andrew and the boy I assumed to be Gulliver. He had dark hair, and was the only one of the three who wasn’t smiling. He had wide eyes, peeping out from below a dark fringe of hair. He carried the ugliness of his species better than most. At least he wasn’t looking happy about what he was, and that was something. Another minute had gone by. It was time to go. We are pleased with your progress. But now the real work must begin. Yes. Deleting documents from computers is not the same as deleting lives. Even human lives. I understand that. A prime number is strong. It does not depend on others. It is pure and complete and never weakens. You must be like a prime. You must not weaken, you must distance yourself, and you must not change after interaction. You must be indivisible. Yes. I will be. Good. Now, continue. Glory Isobel was still not back, on my return to the house, so I did a little more research. She was not a mathematician. She was a historian. On Earth, this was an important distinction as here history was not yet viewed as a sub-division of mathematics, which of course it was. I also discovered that Isobel, like her husband, was considered to be very clever by the standards of her species. I knew this because one of the books on the shelf in the bedroom was The Dark Ages, the one I had seen in the bookshop window. And now I could see it had a quote from a publication called the New York Times which read ‘very clever’. The book was 1,253 pages long. A door opened downstairs. I heard the soft sound of metal keys being rested on a wooden chest. She came up to see me. That was the first thing she did. ‘How are you?’ she asked. ‘I’ve been looking at your book. About the Dark Ages.’ She laughed. ‘What are you laughing at?’ ‘Oh, it’s that or cry.’ ‘Listen,’ I said, ‘do you know where Daniel Russell lives?’ ‘Of course I do. We’ve been to his house for dinner.’ ‘Where does he live?’ ‘In Babraham. He’s got a whopping place. Can you seriously not remember? It’s like not remembering a visit to Nero’s palace.’ ‘Yes. I can, I can. It’s just that there are things which are still a bit hazy. I think it’s the pills. That was a blank, so that’s why I asked. That’s all. So, I’m good friends with him?’ ‘No. You hate him. You can’t stand him. Though deep hostility is your default setting with other academics these days, Ari excepted.’ ‘Ari?’ She sighed. ‘Your best friend.’ ‘Oh, Ari. Yes. Of course. Ari. My ears are a bit blocked. I didn’t hear you properly.’ properly.’ ‘But with Daniel,’ she said, speaking a little louder, ‘if I dare say it, the hatred is just the manifestation of an inferiority complex on your part. But superficially, you get on with him. You’ve even sought his guidance a few times, with your prime number stuff.’ ‘Right. Okay. My prime number stuff. Yes. And where am I with that? Where was I? When I last spoke to you, before?’ I felt the urge to ask it outright. ‘Had I proved the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘No. You hadn’t. At least, not that I knew. But you should probably check that out, because if you have we’ll be a million pounds richer.’ ‘What?’ ‘Dollars, actually, isn’t it?’ ‘I—’ ‘The Millennium Prize, or whatever it is. Proof of the Riemann hypothesis is the largest remaining puzzle that hasn’t been solved. There is an institute in Massachusetts, the other Cambridge, the Clay Institute . . . You know this stuff backwards, Andrew. You mumble this stuff in your sleep.’ ‘Absolutely. Backwards and forwards. All the ways. I just need a little reminding that is all.’ ‘Well, it’s a very wealthy institute. They obviously have a lot of money because they’ve already given about ten million dollars away to other mathematicians. Apart from that last guy.’ ‘Last guy?’ ‘The Russian. Grigori something. The one who turned it down for solving the Whatever-it-was Conjecture.’ ‘But a million dollars is a lot of money, isn’t it?’ ‘It is. It’s a nice amount.’ ‘So why did he turn it down?’ ‘How do I know? I don’t know. You told me he was a recluse who lives with his mother. There are people in this world who have motives that extend beyond the financial, Andrew.’ This was genuinely news to me. ‘Are there?’ ‘Yes. There are. Because, you know, there’s this new groundbreaking and controversial theory that money can’t buy you happiness.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. She laughed again. She was trying to be funny, I think, so I laughed, too. ‘So, no one has solved the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘What? Since yesterday?’ ‘Since, well, ever?’ ‘No. No one has solved it. There was a false alarm, a few years back. ‘No. No one has solved it. There was a false alarm, a few years back. Someone from France. But no. The money is still there.’ ‘So, that is why he . . . why I . . . this is what motivates me, money?’ She was now arranging socks on the bed, in pairs. It was a terrible system she had developed. ‘Not just that,’ she went on. ‘Glory is what motivates you. Ego. You want your name everywhere. Andrew Martin. Andrew Martin. Andrew Martin. You want to be on every Wikipedia page going. You want to be an Einstein. The trouble is, Andrew, you’re still two years old.’ This confused me. ‘I am? How is that possible?’ ‘Your mother never gave you the love you needed. You will for ever be sucking at a nipple that offers no milk. You want the world to know you. You want to be a great man.’ She said this in quite a cool tone. I wondered if this was how people always talked to each other, or if it was just unique to spouses. I heard a key enter a lock. Isobel looked at me with wide, astonished eyes. ‘Gulliver.’ Dark matter Gulliver’s room was at the top of the house. The ‘attic’. The last stop before the thermosphere. He went straight there, his feet passing the bedroom I was in, with only the slightest pause before climbing the final set of stairs. While Isobel went out to walk the dog I decided to phone the number on the piece of paper in my pocket. Maybe it was Daniel Russell’s number. ‘Hello,’ came a voice. Female. ‘Who’s this?’ ‘This is Professor Andrew Martin,’ I said. The female laughed. ‘Well hello, Professor Andrew Martin.’ ‘Who are you? Do you know me?’ ‘You’re on YouTube. Everyone knows you now. You’ve gone viral. The Naked Professor.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘Hey, don’t worry about it. Everyone loves an exhibitionist.’ She spoke slowly, lingering on words as if each one had a taste she didn’t want to lose. ‘Please, how do I know you?’ The question was never answered, because at that precise moment Gulliver walked into the room and I switched off the phone. Gulliver. My ‘son’. The dark-haired boy I had seen in the photographs. He looked as I had expected, but maybe taller. He was nearly as tall as me. His eyes were shaded by his hair. (Hair, by the way, is very important here. Not as important as clothes obviously, but getting there. To humans, hair is more than just a filamentous biomaterial that happens to grow out of their heads. It carries all kinds of social signifiers, most of which I couldn’t translate.) His clothes were as black as space and his T-shirt had the words ‘Dark Matter’ on them. Maybe this was how certain people communicated, via the slogans on their T- shirts. He wore ‘wristbands’. His hands were in his pockets and he seemed uncomfortable looking at my face. (The feeling, then, was mutual.) His voice was low. Or at least low by human standards. About the same depth as a Vonnadorian humming plant. He came and sat on the bed and tried to be nice, at the start, but then at one point he switched to a higher frequency. the start, but then at one point he switched to a higher frequency. ‘Dad, why did you do it?’ ‘I don’t know.’ ‘School is going to be hell now.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘Is that all you can say? “Oh?” Are you serious? Is that fucking it?’ ‘No. Yes. I, I fucking don’t fucking know, Gulliver.’ ‘Well, you’ve destroyed my life. I’m a joke. It was bad before. Ever since I started there. But now—’ I wasn’t listening. I was thinking about Daniel Russell, and how I desperately needed to phone him. Gulliver noticed I wasn’t paying attention. ‘It doesn’t even matter. You never want to talk to me, apart from last night.’ Gulliver left the room. He slammed the door, and let out a kind of growl. He was fifteen years old. This meant he belonged to a special sub-category of human called a ‘teenager’, the chief characteristics of which were a weakened resistance to gravity, a vocabulary of grunts, a lack of spatial awareness, copious amounts of masturbation, and an unending appetite for cereal. Last night. I got out of bed and headed upstairs to the attic. I knocked on his door. There was no reply but I opened it anyway. Inside, the environment was one of prevailing dark. There were posters for musicians. Thermostat, Skrillex, The Fetid, Mother Night, and the Dark Matter his T-shirt referenced. There was a window sloped in line with the ceiling, but the blind was drawn. There was a book on the bed. It was called Ham on Rye, by Charles Bukowski. There were clothes on the floor. Together, the room was a data cloud of despair. I sensed he wanted to be put out of his misery, one way or another. That would come, of course, but first there would be a few more questions. He didn’t hear me enter owing to the audio transmitter he had plugged into his ears. Nor did he see me, as he was too busy staring at his computer. On the screen, there was a still-motion image of myself naked, walking past one of the university buildings. There was also some writing on the screen. At the top were the words ‘Gulliver Martin, You Must Be So Proud’. Underneath, there were lots of comments. A typical example read, ‘HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! Oh almost forgot – HA!’ I read the name next to that particular post. ‘Who is Theo “The Fucking Business” Clarke?’ Gulliver jumped at my voice and turned around. I asked my question again but didn’t receive an answer. ‘What are you doing?’ I asked, purely for research purposes. ‘What are you doing?’ I asked, purely for research purposes. ‘Just go away.’ ‘I want to talk to you. I want to talk about last night.’ He turned his back to me. His torso stiffened. ‘Go away, Dad.’ ‘No. I want to know what I said to you.’ He sprang out of his chair and, as the humans say, stormed over to me. ‘Just leave me alone, okay? You’ve never been interested in a single thing about my life so don’t start now. Why fucking start now?’ I watched the back of him in the small, circular mirror staring out from the wall like a dull and unblinking eye. After some aggressive pacing he sat back in his chair, turned to his computer again, and pressed his finger on an odd-looking command device. ‘I need to know something,’ I said. ‘I need to know if you know what I was doing. Last week at work?’ ‘Dad, just—’ ‘Listen, this is important. Were you still up when I came home? You know, last night? Were you in the house? Were you awake?’ He mumbled something. I didn’t hear what. Only an ipsoid would have heard it. ‘Gulliver, how are you at mathematics?’ ‘You know how I fucking am at maths.’ ‘Fucking no, I don’t. Not now. That is why I am fucking asking. Tell me what you fucking know.’ Nothing. I thought I was using his language, but Gulliver just sat there, staring away from me, with his right leg jerking up and down in slight but rapid movements. My words were having no effect. I thought of the audio transmitter he still had in one ear. Maybe it was sending radio signals. I waited a little while longer and sensed it was time to leave. But as I headed for the door he said, ‘Yeah. I was up. You told me.’ My heart raced. ‘What? What did I tell you?’ ‘About you being the saviour of the human race or something.’ ‘Anything more specific? Did I go into detail?’ ‘You proved your precious Rainman hypothesis.’ ‘Riemann. Riemann. The Riemann hypothesis. I told you that, fucking did I?’ ‘Yeah,’ he said, in the same glum tone. ‘First time you’d spoken to me in a week.’ ‘Who have you told?’ ‘What? Dad, I think people are more interested in the fact that you walked around the town centre naked, to be honest. No one’s going to care about some equation.’ equation.’ ‘But your mother? Have you told her? She must have asked you if I’d spoken to you, after I’d gone missing. Surely she asked you that?’ He shrugged. (A shrug, I realised, was one of the main modes of communication for teenagers.) ‘Yeah.’ ‘And? What did you say? Come on, speak to me, Gulliver. What does she know about it?’ He turned and looked me straight in the eye. He was frowning. Angry. Confused. ‘I don’t fucking believe you, Dad.’ ‘Fucking believe?’ ‘You’re the parent, I’m the kid. I’m the one who should be wrapped up in myself, not you. I’m fifteen and you’re forty-three. If you are genuinely ill, Dad, then I want to be there for you, but aside from your new-found love of streaking and your weird fucking swearing you are acting very, very, very much like yourself. But here’s a newsflash. You ready? We don’t actually care about your prime numbers. We don’t care about your precious fucking work or your stupid fucking books or your genius-like brain or your ability to solve the world’s greatest outstanding mathematical whatever because, because, because all these things hurt us.’ ‘Hurt you?’ Maybe the boy was wiser than he looked. ‘What do you mean by that?’ His eyes stayed on me. His chest rose and fell with visible intensity. ‘Nothing,’ he said at last. ‘But, the answer is no, I didn’t tell Mum. I said you said something about work. That’s all. I didn’t think it was relevant information right then to tell her about your fucking hypothesis.’ ‘But the money. You know about that?’ ‘Yeah, course I do.’ ‘And you still didn’t think it was a big deal?’ ‘Dad, we have quite a lot of money in the bank. We have one of the biggest houses in Cambridge. I’m probably the richest kid in my school now. But it doesn’t amount to shit. It isn’t the Perse, remember?’ ‘The Perse?’ ‘That school you spent twenty grand a year on. You’ve forgotten that? Who the hell are you? Jason Bourne?’ ‘No. I am not.’ ‘You probably forgot I was expelled, too.’ ‘No,’ I lied. ‘Course I haven’t.’ ‘I don’t think more money’s going to save us.’ I was genuinely confused. This went against everything we were meant to know about the humans. know about the humans. ‘No,’ I said. ‘You’re right. It won’t. And besides, it was a mistake. I haven’t proved the Riemann hypothesis. I think in fact it is unprovable. I thought I had, but I haven’t. So there is nothing to tell anyone.’ At which Gulliver pushed the audio-transmission device into his other ear and closed his eyes. He wanted no more of me. ‘Fucking okay,’ I whispered and left the room. Emily Dickinson I went downstairs and found an ‘address book’. Inside were addresses and telephone numbers for people, listed alphabetically. I found the telephone number I was looking for. A woman told me Daniel Russell was out but would be back in around an hour. He would phone me back. Meanwhile, I perused some more history books and learnt things as I read between the lines. As well as religion, human history is full of depressing things like colonisation, disease, racism, sexism, homophobia, class snobbery, environmental destruction, slavery, totalitarianism, military dictatorships, inventions of things which they have no idea how to handle (the atomic bomb, the Internet, the semi-colon), the victimisation of clever people, the worshipping of idiotic people, boredom, despair, periodic collapses, and catastrophes within the psychic landscape. And through it all there has always been some truly awful food. I found a book called The Great American Poets. ‘I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,’ wrote someone called Walt Whitman. It was an obvious point, but something about it was quite beautiful. In the same book, there were words written by another poet. The poet was Emily Dickinson. The words were these: How happy is the little stone That rambles in the road alone, And doesn’t care about careers, And exigencies never fears; Whose coat of elemental brown A passing universe put on; And independent as the sun, Associates or glows alone, Fulfilling absolute decree In casual simplicity. Fulfilling absolute decree, I thought. Why do these words trouble me? The dog growled at me. I turned the page and found more unlikely wisdom. I read the words aloud to myself: ‘The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.’ ‘You’re out of bed,’ said Isobel. ‘Yes,’ I said. To be a human is to state the obvious. Repeatedly, over and over, until the end of time. ‘You need to eat,’ she added, after studying my face. ‘Yes,’ I said. She got out some ingredients. Gulliver walked past the doorway. ‘Gull, where are you going? I’m making dinner.’ The boy said nothing as he left. The slam of the door almost shook the house. ‘I’m worried about him,’ said Isobel. As she worried, I studied the ingredients on the worktop. Mainly green vegetation. But then something else. Chicken breast. I thought about this. And I kept thinking. The breast of a chicken. The breast of a chicken. The breast of a chicken. ‘That looks like meat,’ I said. ‘I’m going to make a stir-fry.’ ‘With that?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘The breast of a chicken?’ ‘Yes, Andrew. Or are you vegetarian now?’ The dog was in his basket. It went by the name of Newton. It was still growling at me. ‘What about the dog’s breasts? Are we going to eat those, too?’ ‘No,’ she said, with resignation. I was testing her. ‘Is a dog more intelligent than a chicken?’ ‘Yes,’ she said. She closed her eyes. ‘I don’t know. No. I haven’t got time for this. Anyway, you’re the big meat eater.’ I was uncomfortable. ‘I would rather not eat the chicken’s breasts.’ Isobel now clenched her eyes closed. She inhaled deeply. ‘Give me strength,’ she whispered. I could have done so, of course. But I needed what strength I had right now. Isobel handed me my diazepam. ‘Have you taken one lately?’ ‘No.’ ‘You probably should.’ So I humoured her. I unscrewed the cap and placed a pill on my palm. These ones looked like word-capsules. As green as knowledge. I popped a tablet in my mouth. Be careful. Dishwasher I ate the vegetable stir-fry. It smelt like Bazadean body waste. I tried not to look at it, so I looked at Isobel instead. It was the first time that looking at a human face was the easiest option. But I did need to eat. So I ate. ‘When you spoke to Gulliver about me going missing did he say anything to you?’ ‘Yes,’ she said. ‘What was it that he said?’ ‘That you came in about eleven, and that you’d gone into the living room where he was watching TV and that you’d told him that you were sorry you were late, but you’d been finishing something off at work.’ ‘Was that it? There was nothing more specific?’ ‘No.’ ‘What do you think he meant by that? I mean: what I meant by that?’ ‘I don’t know. But I have to say, you coming home and being friendly to Gulliver. That’s already out of character.’ ‘Why? Don’t I like him?’ ‘Not since two years ago. No. Pains me to say it, but you don’t act very much like you do.’ ‘Two years ago?’ ‘Since he got expelled from Perse. For starting a fire.’ ‘Oh yes. The fire incident.’ ‘I want you to start making an effort with him.’ Afterwards, I followed Isobel into the kitchen putting my plate and cutlery in the dishwasher. I was noticing more things about her. At first, I had just seen her as generically human but now I was appreciating the details. Picking up things I hadn’t noticed – differences between her and the others. She was wearing a cardigan and blue trousers known as jeans. Her long neck was decorated with a thin necklace made out of silver. Her eyes stared deep into things, as though she was continually searching for something that wasn’t there. Or as if it was there, but just out of sight. It was as though everything had a depth, an internal distance but just out of sight. It was as though everything had a depth, an internal distance to it. ‘How are you feeling?’ she asked. She seemed worried about something. ‘I feel fine.’ ‘I only ask because you’re loading the dishwasher.’ ‘Because that’s what you are doing.’ ‘Andrew, you never load the dishwasher. You are, and I mean this in the least offensive way possible, something of a domestic primitive.’ ‘Why? Don’t mathematicians load dishwashers?’ ‘In this house,’ she said sadly, ‘no, actually. No, they don’t.’ ‘Oh yes. I know. Obviously. I just fancied helping today. I help sometimes.’ ‘Now we’re on to fractions.’ She looked at my jumper. There was a bit of noodle resting on the blue wool. She picked it off, and stroked the fabric where it had been. She smiled, quickly. She cared about me. She had her reservations, but she cared. I didn’t want her to care about me. It wouldn’t help things. She placed her hand through my hair, to tidy it a bit. To my surprise, I wasn’t flinching. ‘Einstein chic is one thing but this is ridiculous,’ she said, softly. I smiled like I understood. She smiled too, but it was a smile on top of something else. As if she was wearing a mask, and there was a near-identical but less smiling face underneath. ‘It’s almost like an alien clone is in my kitchen.’ ‘Almost,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ It was then that the telephone rang. Isobel went to answer it and a moment later came back into the kitchen, holding out the receiver. ‘It’s for you,’ she said, in a suddenly serious voice. Her eyes were wide, trying to convey a silent message I didn’t quite understand. ‘Hello?’ I said. There was a long pause. The sound of breath, and then a voice on the next exhalation. A man, talking slowly and carefully. ‘Andrew? Is that you?’ ‘Yes. Who’s this?’ ‘It’s Daniel. Daniel Russell.’ My heart tripped. I realised this was it, the moment things had to change. ‘Oh hello, Daniel.’ ‘How are you? I hear you might be unwell.’ ‘Oh, I am fine, really. It was just a little bit of mental exhaustion. My mind had run its own marathon and it struggled. My brain is made for sprints. It doesn’t have the stamina for long-distance running. But don’t worry, honestly, I am back where I was. It wasn’t anything too serious. Nothing that the right medication couldn’t suppress, anyway.’ medication couldn’t suppress, anyway.’ ‘Well, that is good to hear. I was worried about you. Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you about that remarkable email you sent me.’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘But let’s not do this over the phone. Let’s chat face-to-face. It would be good to see you.’ Isobel frowned. ‘What a good idea. Should I come to you?’ ‘No,’ I said, with a degree of firmness. ‘No. I’ll come to you.’ We are waiting. A large house Isobel had offered to drive me, and had tried to insist on it, saying I wasn’t ready to leave the house. Of course, I had already left the house, to go to Fitzwilliam College, but she hadn’t known about that. I said I felt like some exercise and Daniel needed to speak to me quite urgently about something, possibly some kind of job offer. I told her I’d have my phone on me and that she knew where I was. And so eventually I was able to take the address from Isobel’s notebook, leave the house and head to Babraham. To a large house, the largest I’d seen. Daniel Russell’s wife answered the door. She was a very tall, broad- shouldered woman, with quite long grey hair and aged skin. ‘Oh, Andrew.’ She held out her arms wide. I replicated the gesture. And she kissed me on the cheek. She smelt of soap and spices. It was clear she knew me. She couldn’t stop saying my name. ‘Andrew, Andrew, how are you?’ she asked me. ‘I heard about your little misadventure.’ ‘Well, I am all right. It was a, well, an episode. But I’m over it. The story continues.’ She studied me a little more and then opened the door wide. She beckoned me inside, smiling broadly. I stepped into the hallway. ‘Do you know why I am here?’ ‘To see Him Upstairs,’ she said, pointing to the ceiling. ‘Yes, but do you know why I am here to see him?’ She was puzzled by my manner but she tried her best to hide it beneath a kind of energetic and chaotic politeness. ‘No, Andrew,’ she said, quickly. ‘As a matter of fact, he didn’t say.’ I nodded. I noticed a large ceramic vase on the floor. It had a yellow pattern of flowers on it, and I wondered why people bothered with such empty vessels. What was their significance? Maybe I would never know. We passed a room, with a sofa and a television and bookcases and dark red walls. Blood-coloured. with a sofa and a television and bookcases and dark red walls. Blood-coloured. ‘Do you want a coffee? Fruit juice? We’ve acquired a taste for pomegranate juice. Though Daniel believes antioxidants are a marketing ploy.’ ‘I would like a water if that’s okay.’ We were in the kitchen now. It was about twice the size of Andrew Martin’s kitchen, but it was so cluttered it felt no bigger. There were saucepans hanging above my head. There was an envelope on the unit addressed to ‘Daniel and Tabitha Russell’. Tabitha poured me water from a jug. ‘I’d offer you a slice of lemon but I think we’re out. There’s one in the bowl but it must be blue by now. The cleaners never sort the fruit out. They won’t touch it. ‘And Daniel won’t eat fruit. Even though the doctor has told him he’s got to. But then the doctor has told him to relax and slow down, too, and he doesn’t do that either.’ ‘Oh. Why?’ She looked baffled. ‘His heart attack. You remember that? You aren’t the only frazzled mathematician in the world.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘How is he?’ ‘Well, he’s on beta-blockers. I’m trying to get him on muesli and skimmed milk and to take it easier.’ ‘His heart,’ I said, thinking aloud. ‘Yes. His heart.’ ‘That is one of the reasons I came, in fact.’ She handed me a glass and I took a sip. As I did so, I thought of the startling capacity for belief inherent in this species. Even before I had fully discovered the concepts of astrology, homeopathy, organised religion and probiotic yoghurts I was able to work out that what humans may have lacked in physical attractiveness, they made up for in gullibility. You could tell them anything in a convincing enough voice and they would believe it. Anything, of course, except the truth. ‘Where is he?’ ‘In his study. Upstairs.’ ‘His study?’ ‘You know where that is, don’t you?’ ‘Of course. Of course. I know where that is.’ Daniel Russell Of course, I had been lying. I had no idea where Daniel Russell’s study was, and this was a very big house, but as I was walking along the first-floor landing I heard a voice. The same dry voice I had heard on the phone. ‘Is that the saviour of mankind?’ I followed the voice all the way to the third doorway on the left, which was half-open. I could see framed pieces of paper lining a wall. I pushed open the door and saw a bald man with a sharp angular face and a small – in human terms – mouth. He was smartly dressed. He was wearing a red bow tie and a checked shirt. ‘Pleased to see you’re wearing clothes,’ he said, suppressing a sly smile. ‘Our neighbours are people of delicate sensibilities.’ ‘Yes. I am wearing the right amount of clothes. Don’t worry about that.’ He nodded, and kept nodding, as he leant back in his chair and scratched his chin. A computer screen glowed behind him, full of Andrew Martin’s curves and formulas. I could smell coffee. I noticed an empty cup. Two of them, in fact. ‘I have looked at it. And I have looked at it again. This must have taken you to the edge, I can see that. This is something. You must have been burning yourself with this, Andrew. I’ve been burning just reading through it.’ ‘I worked very hard,’ I said. ‘I was lost in it. But that happens, doesn’t it, with numbers?’ He listened with concern. ‘Did they prescribe anything?’ he asked. ‘Diazepam.’ ‘Do you feel it’s working?’ ‘I do. I do. I feel it is working. Everything feels a little bit alien I would say, a tad other-worldly, as if the atmosphere is slightly different, and the gravity has slightly less pull, and even something as familiar as an empty coffee cup has a terrible difference to it. You know, from my perspective. Even you. You seem quite hideous to me. Almost terrifying.’ Daniel Russell laughed. It wasn’t a happy laugh. Daniel Russell laughed. It wasn’t a happy laugh. ‘Well, there’s always been a frisson between us, but I always put that down to academic rivalry. Par for the course. We’re not geographers or biologists. We’re numbers men. We mathematicians have always been like that. Look at that miserable bastard Isaac Newton.’ ‘I named my dog after him.’ ‘So you did. But listen, Andrew, this isn’t a moment to nudge you to the kerb. This is a moment to slap you on the back.’ We were wasting time. ‘Have you told anyone about this?’ He shook his head. ‘No. Of course not. Andrew, this is yours. You can publicise this how you want. Though I would probably advise you, as a friend, to wait a little while. At least a week or so, until all this unwelcome stuff about your little Corpus incident has died down.’ ‘Is mathematics less interesting for humans than nudity?’ ‘It tends to be, Andrew. Yes. Listen. Go home, take it easy this week. I’ll put a word in with Diane at Fitz and explain that you’ll be fine but you may need some time off. I’m sure she’ll be pretty flexible. The students are going to be tricky on your first day back. You need to build your strength up. Rest a while. Come on Andrew, go home.’ I could smell the foul scent of coffee getting stronger. I looked around at all the certificates on the wall and felt thankful to come from a place where personal success was meaningless. ‘Home?’ I said. ‘Do you know where that is?’ ‘Course I do. Andrew, what are you talking about?’ ‘Actually, I am not called Andrew.’ Another nervous chuckle. ‘Is Andrew Martin your stage name? If it is, I could have thought of better.’ ‘I don’t have a name. Names are a symptom of a species which values the individual self above the collective good.’ This was the first time he stood up out of his chair. He was a tall man, taller than me. ‘This would be amusing, Andrew, if you weren’t a friend. I really think you might need to get proper medical help for this. Listen, I know a very good psychiatrist who you—’ ‘Andrew Martin is someone else. He was taken.’ ‘Taken?’ ‘After he proved what he proved, we were left with no choice.’ ‘We? What are you talking about? Just have an objective ear, Andrew. You are sounding out of your mind. I think you ought to go home. I’ll drive you back. I think it would be safer. Come on, let’s go. I’ll take you home. Back to your family.’ He held out his right arm, gesturing towards the door. But I wasn’t going anywhere. The pain ‘You said you wanted to slap my back.’ He frowned. Above the frown, the skin covering the top of his skull shone. I stared at it. At the shine. ‘What?’ ‘You wanted to slap my back. That is what you said. So, why not?’ ‘What?’ ‘Slap my back. Then I will go.’ ‘Andrew—’ ‘Slap my back.’ He exhaled slowly. His eyes were the mid-point between concern and fear. I turned, gave him my back. Waited for the hand, then waited some more. Then it came. He slapped my back. On that first contact, even with clothes between us, I made the reading. Then when I turned, for less than a second, my face wasn’t Andrew Martin’s. It was mine. ‘What the—’ He lurched backwards, bumping into his desk. I was, to his eyes, Andrew Martin again. But he had seen what he had seen. I only had a second, before he would begin screaming, so I paralysed his jaw. Somewhere way below the panic of his bulging eyes, there was a question: how did he do that? To finish the job properly I would need another contact: my left hand on his shoulder was sufficient. Then the pain began. The pain I had summoned. He held his arm. His face became violet. The colour of home. I had pain too. Head pain. And fatigue. But I walked past him, as he dropped to his knees, and deleted the email and the attachment. I checked his sent folder but there was nothing suspicious. I stepped out on to the landing. ‘Tabitha! Tabitha, call an ambulance! Quick! I think, I think Daniel is having a heart attack!’ Egypt Less than a minute later she was upstairs, on the phone, her face full of panic as she knelt down, trying to push a pill – an aspirin – into her husband’s mouth. ‘His mouth won’t open! His mouth won’t open! Daniel, open your mouth! Darling, oh my God darling, open your mouth!’ And then to the phone. ‘Yes! I told you! I told you! The Hollies! Yes! Chaucer Road! He’s dying! He’s dying!’ She managed to cram inside her husband’s mouth a piece of the pill, which bubbled into foam and dribbled onto the carpet. ‘Mnnnnnn,’ her husband was saying desperately. ‘Mnnnnnn.’ I stood there watching him. His eyes stayed wide, wide open, ipsoid-wide, as if staying in the world was a simple matter of forcing yourself to see. ‘Daniel, it’s all right,’ Tabitha was saying, right into his face. ‘An ambulance is on its way. You’ll be okay, darling.’ His eyes were now on me. He jerked in my direction. ‘Mnnnnnn!’ He was trying to warn his wife. ‘Mnnnnnn.’ She didn’t understand. Tabitha was stroking her husband’s hair with a manic tenderness. ‘Daniel, we’re going to Egypt. Come on, think of Egypt. We’re going to see the Pyramids. It’s only two weeks till we go. Come on, it’s going to be beautiful. You’ve always wanted to go . . .’ As I watched her I felt a strange sensation. A kind of longing for something, a craving, but for what I had no idea. I was mesmerised by the sight of this human female crouched over the man whose blood I had prevented from reaching his heart. ‘You got through it last time and you’ll get through it this time.’ ‘No,’ I whispered, unheard. ‘No, no, no.’ ‘Mnnn,’ he said, gripping his shoulder in infinite pain. ‘I love you, Daniel.’ His eyes clenched shut now, the pain too much. ‘Stay with me, stay with me, I can’t live all alone . . .’ His head was on her knee. She kept caressing his face. So this was love. Two His head was on her knee. She kept caressing his face. So this was love. Two life forms in mutual reliance. I was meant to be thinking I was watching weakness, something to scorn, but I wasn’t thinking that at all. He stopped making noise, he seemed instantly heavier for her, and the deep clenched creases around his eyes softened and relaxed. It was done. Tabitha howled, as if something had been physically wrenched out of her. I have never heard anything like that sound. It troubled me greatly, I have to say. A cat emerged from the doorway, startled by the noise maybe, but indifferent to the scene in general. It returned back from where it came. ‘No,’ said Tabitha, over and over, ‘no, no, no!’ Outside, the ambulance skidded to a halt on the gravel. Blue flashing lights appeared through the window. ‘They’re here,’ I told Tabitha and went downstairs. It was a strange and overwhelming relief to tread my way down those soft, carpeted stairs, and for those desperate sobs and futile commands to fade away into nothing. Where we are from I thought about where we – you and I – are from. Where we are from there are no comforting delusions, no religions, no impossible fiction. Where we are from there is no love and no hate. There is the purity of reason. Where we are from there are no crimes of passion because there is no passion. Where we are from there is no remorse because action has a logical motive and always results in the best outcome for the given situation. Where we are from there are no names, no families living together, no husbands and wives, no sulky teenagers, no madness. Where we are from we have solved the problem of fear because we have solved the problem of death. We will not die. Which means we can’t just let the universe do what it wants to do, because we will be inside it for eternity. Where we are from we will never be lying on a luxurious carpet, clutching our chest as our faces turn purple and our eyes seek desperately to view our surroundings for one last time. Where we are from our technology, created on the back of our supreme and comprehensive knowledge of mathematics, has meant not only that we can travel great distances, but also that we can rearrange our own biological ingredients, renew and replenish them. We are psychologically equipped for such advances. We have never been at war with ourselves. We never place the desires of the individual over the requirements of the collective. Where we are from we understand that if the humans’ rate of mathematical advancement exceeds their psychological maturity, then action needs to be taken. For instance, the death of Daniel Russell, and the knowledge he held, could end up saving many more lives. And so: he is a logical and justifiable sacrifice. Where we are from there are no nightmares. And yet, that night, for the very first time in my life I had a nightmare. A world of dead humans with me and that indifferent cat walking through a A world of dead humans with me and that indifferent cat walking through a giant carpeted street full of bodies. I was trying to get home. But I couldn’t. I was stuck here. I had become one of them. Stuck in human form, unable to escape the inevitable fate awaiting all of them. And I was getting hungry and I needed to eat but I couldn’t eat, because my mouth was clamped shut. The hunger became extreme. I was starving, wasting away at rapid speed. I went to the garage I had been in that first night and tried to shove food in my mouth, but it was no good. It was still locked from this inexplicable paralysis. I knew I was going to die. Die. How did humans ever stomach the idea? I woke. I was sweating and out of breath. Isobel touched my back. ‘It’s all right,’ she said, as Tabitha had said. ‘It’s all right, it’s all right, it’s all right.’ The dog and the music The next day I was alone. Well no, actually, that’s not quite true. I wasn’t alone. There was the dog. Newton. The dog named after a human who had come up with the ideas of gravity and inertia. Given the slow speed with which the dog left its basket, I realised the name was a fitting tribute to these discoveries. He was awake now. He was old and he hobbled, and he was half-blind. He knew who I was. Or who I wasn’t. And he growled whenever he was near me. I didn’t quite understand his language just yet but I sensed he was displeased. He showed his teeth but I could tell years of subservience to his bipedal owners meant the very fact that I was standing up was enough for me to command a certain degree of respect. I felt sick. I put this down to the new air I was breathing. But each time I closed my eyes I saw Daniel Russell’s anguished face as he lay on the carpet. I also had a headache, but that was the lingering after-effect of the energy I had exerted yesterday. I knew life was going to be easier during my short stay here if Newton was on my side. He might have information, have picked up on signals, heard things. And I knew there was one rule that held fast across the universe: if you wanted to get someone on your side what you really had to do was relieve their pain. It seems ridiculous now, such logic. But the truth was even more ridiculous, and too dangerous to acknowledge to myself, that after the need to hurt I felt an urge to heal. So I went over and gave him a biscuit. And then, after giving him the biscuit, I gave him sight. And then, as I stroked his hind leg, he whimpered words into my ear I couldn’t quite translate. I healed him, giving myself not only an even more intense headache but also wave upon wave of fatigue in the process. Indeed, so exhausted was I that I fell asleep on the kitchen floor. When I woke up, I was coated in dog saliva. Newton’s tongue was still at it, licking me with considerable enthusiasm. Licking, licking, licking, as though the meaning of considerable enthusiasm. Licking, licking, licking, as though the meaning of canine existence was something just beneath my skin. ‘Could you please stop that?’ I said. But he couldn’t. Not until I stood up. He was physically incapable of stopping. And even once I had stood up he tried to stand up with me, and on me, as if he wanted to be upright, too. It was then I realised the one thing worse than having a dog hate you is having a dog love you. Seriously, if there was a needier species in the universe I had yet to meet it. ‘Get away,’ I told him. ‘I don’t want your love.’ I went to the living room and sat down on the sofa. I needed to think. Would Daniel Russell’s death be viewed by the humans as suspicious? A man on heart medication succumbing to a second and this time fatal heart attack? I had no poison, and no weapon they would ever be able to identify. The dog sat down next to me, placed his head on my lap, then lifted his head off my lap, and then on again, as if deciding whether or not to put his head on my lap was the biggest decision he had ever faced. We spent hours together that day. Me and the dog. At first I was annoyed that he wouldn’t leave me alone, as what I needed to do was to focus and work out when I was going to act next. To work out how much more information I needed to acquire before doing what would have to be my final acts here, eliminating Andrew Martin’s wife and child. I shouted at the dog again to leave me alone, and he did so, but when I stood in the living room with nothing but my thoughts and plans I realised I felt a terrible loneliness and so called him back. And he came, and seemed happy to be wanted again. I put something on that interested me. It was called The Planets by Gustav Holst. It was a piece of music all about the humans’ puny solar system, so it was surprising to hear it had quite an epic feel. Another confusing thing was that it was divided into seven ‘movements’ each named after ‘astrological characters’. For instance, Mars was ‘the Bringer of War’, Jupiter was ‘the Bringer of Jollity’, and Saturn was ‘the Bringer of Old Age’. This primitivism struck me as funny. And so was the idea that the music had anything whatsoever to do with those dead planets. But it seemed to soothe Newton a little bit, and I must admit one or two parts of it had some kind of effect on me, a kind of electrochemical effect. Listening to music, I realised, was simply the pleasure of counting without realising you were counting. As the electrical impulses were transported from the neurons in my ear through my body, I felt – I don’t know – calm. It made that strange unease that had been with me since I had watched Daniel Russell die on his carpet settle a little. As we listened I tried to work out why Newton and his species were so enamoured of humans. enamoured of humans. ‘Tell me,’ I said. ‘What is it about the humans?’ Newton laughed. Or as close as a dog can get to laughing, which is pretty close. I persisted with my line of enquiry. ‘Go on,’ I said. ‘Spill the beans.’ He seemed a bit coy. I don’t think he really had an answer. Maybe he hadn’t reached his verdict, or he was too loyal to be truthful. I put on some different music. I played the music of someone called Ennio Morricone. I played an album called Space Oddity by David Bowie, which, in its simple patterned measure of time, was actually quite enjoyable. As was Moon Safari by Air, though that shed little light on the moon itself. I played A Love Supreme by John Coltrane and Blue Monk by Thelonious Monk. This was jazz music. It was full of the complexity and contradictions that I would soon learn made humans human. I listened to ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ by Leonard Bernstein and ‘Moonlight Sonata’ by Ludwig van Beethoven and Brahms’ ‘Intermezzo op. 17’. I listened to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Daft Punk, Prince, Talking Heads, Al Greene, Tom Waits, Mozart. I was intrigued to discover the sounds that could make it on to music – the strange talking radio voice on ‘I Am the Walrus’ by the Beatles, the cough at the beginning of Prince’s ‘Raspberry Beret’ and at the end of Tom Waits songs. Maybe that is what beauty was, for humans. Accidents, imperfections, placed inside a pretty pattern. Asymmetry. The defiance of mathematics. I thought about my speech at the Museum of Quadratic Equations. With the Beach Boys I got a strange feeling, behind my eyes and in my stomach. I had no idea what that feeling was, but it made me think of Isobel, and the way she had hugged me last night, after I had come home and told her Daniel Russell had suffered a fatal heart attack in front of me. There’d been a slight moment of suspicion, a brief hardening of her stare, but it had softened into compassion. Whatever else she might have thought about her husband he wasn’t a killer. The last thing I listened to was a tune called ‘Clair de Lune’ by Debussy. That was the closest representation of space I had ever heard, and I stood there, in the middle of the room, frozen with shock that a human could have made such a beautiful noise. This beauty terrified me, like an alien creature appearing out of nowhere. An ipsoid, bursting out of the desert. I had to stay focused. I had to keep believing everything I had been told. That this was a species of ugliness and violence, beyond redemption. Newton was scratching at the front door. The scratching was putting me off the music so I went over and tried to decipher what he wanted. It turned out that what he wanted was to go outside. There was a ‘lead’ I had seen Isobel use, and so I attached it to the collar. so I attached it to the collar. As I walked the dog I tried to think more negatively towards the humans. And it certainly seemed ethically questionable, the relationship between humans and dogs, both of whom – on the scale of intelligence that covered every species in the universe – would have been somewhere in the middle, not too far apart. But I have to say that dogs didn’t seem to mind it. In fact, they went along quite happily with the set-up most of the time. I let Newton lead the way. We passed a man on the other side of the road. The man just stopped and stared at me and smiled to himself. I smiled and waved my hand, understanding this was an appropriate human greeting. He didn’t wave back. Yes, humans are a troubling species. We carried on walking, and we passed another man. A man in a wheelchair. He seemed to know me. ‘Andrew,’ he said, ‘isn’t it terrible – the news about Daniel Russell?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I was there. I saw it happen. It was horrible, just horrible.’ ‘Oh my God, I had no idea.’ ‘Mortality is a very tragic thing.’ ‘Indeed, indeed it is.’ ‘Anyway, I had better be going. The dog is in quite a hurry. I will see you.’ ‘Yes, yes, absolutely. But may I ask: how are you? I heard you’d been a bit unwell yourself?’ ‘Oh, fine. I am over that. It was just a bit of a misunderstanding, really.’ ‘Oh, I see.’ The conversation dwindled further, and I made my excuses, Newton dragging me forward until we reached a large stretch of grass. This is what dogs liked to do, I discovered. They liked to run around on grass, pretending they were free, shouting, ‘We’re free, we’re free, look, look, look how free we are!’ at each other. It really was a sorry sight. But it worked for them, and for Newton in particular. It was a collective illusion they had chosen to swallow and they were submitting to it wholeheartedly, without any nostalgia for their former wolf selves. That was the remarkable thing about humans – their ability to shape the path of other species, to change their fundamental nature. Maybe it could happen to me, maybe I could be changed, maybe I already was being changed? Who knew? I hoped not. I hoped I was staying as pure as I had been told, as strong and isolated as a prime, as a ninety-seven. I sat on a bench and watched the traffic. No matter how long I stayed on this planet I doubted I would ever get used to the sight of cars, bound by gravity and poor technology to the road, hardly moving on the roads because there were so many of them. many of them. Was it wrong to thwart a species’ technological advancement? That was a new question in my mind. I didn’t want it there, so I was quite relieved when Newton started barking. I turned to look at him. He was standing still, his head steady in one direction, as he carried on making as loud a noise as he possibly could. ‘Look!’ he seemed to bark. ‘Look! Look! Look!’ I was picking up his language. There was another road, a different one to the one with all the traffic. A line of terraced houses facing the park. I turned towards it, as Newton clearly wanted me to do. I saw Gulliver, on his own, walking along the pavement, trying his best to hide behind his hair. He was meant to be at school. And he wasn’t, unless human school was walking along the street and thinking, which it really should have been. He saw me. He froze. And then he turned around and started walking in the other direction. ‘Gulliver!’ I called. ‘Gulliver!’ He ignored me. If anything, he started walking away faster than he had done before. His behaviour concerned me. After all, inside his head was the knowledge that the world’s biggest mathematical puzzle had been solved, and by his own father. I hadn’t acted last night. I had told myself that I needed to find more information, check there was no one else Andrew Martin could have told. Also, I was probably too exhausted after my encounter with Daniel. I would wait another day, maybe even two. That had been the plan. Gulliver had told me he hadn’t said anything, and that he wasn’t going to, but how could he be totally trusted? His mother was convinced, right now, that he was at school. And yet he evidently wasn’t. I got up from the bench and walked over the litter-strewn grass to where Newton was still barking. ‘Come on,’ I said, realising I should probably have acted already. ‘We have to go.’ We arrived on the road just as Gulliver was turning off it, and so I decided to follow him and see where he was going. At one point he stopped and took something from his pocket. A box. He took out a cylindrical object and put it in his mouth and lit it. He turned around, but I had sensed he would and was already hiding behind a tree. He began walking again. Soon he reached a larger road. Coleridge Road, this one was called. He didn’t want to be on this road for long. Too many cars. Too many opportunities to be seen. He kept on walking, and after a while the buildings stopped and there were no cars or people any more. I was worried he was going to turn around, because there were no nearby trees – or anything else – to hide behind. Also, although I was physically near enough to be easily seen if he did turn to look, I was too far for any mind manipulation to be easily seen if he did turn to look, I was too far for any mind manipulation to work. Remarkably though, he didn’t turn around again. Not once. We passed a building with lots of empty cars outside, shining in the sun. The building had the word ‘Honda’ on it. There was a man inside the glass in a shirt and tie, watching us. Gulliver then cut across a grass field. Eventually, he reached four metal tracks in the ground: parallel lines, close together but stretching as far as the eye could see. He just stood there, absolutely still, waiting for something. Newton looked at Gulliver and then up at me, with concern. He let out a deliberately loud whine. ‘Sssh!’ I said. ‘Keep quiet.’ After a while, a train appeared in the distance, getting closer as it was carried along the tracks. I noticed Gulliver’s fists clench and his whole body stiffen as he stood only a metre or so away from the train’s path. As the train was about to pass where he was standing Newton barked, but the train was too loud and too close to Gulliver for him to hear. This was interesting. Maybe I wouldn’t have to do anything. Maybe Gulliver was going to do it himself. The train passed. Gulliver’s hands stopped being fists and he seemed to relax again. Or maybe it was disappointment. But before he turned around and started walking away, I had dragged Newton back, and we were out of sight. Grigori Perelman So, I had left Gulliver. Untouched, unharmed. I had returned home with Newton while Gulliver had carried on walking. I had no idea where he was going, but it was pretty clear to me, from his lack of direction, that he hadn’t been heading anywhere specific. I concluded, therefore, that he wasn’t going to meet someone. Indeed, he had seemed to want to avoid people. Still, I knew it was dangerous. I knew that it wasn’t just proof of the Riemann hypothesis which was the problem. It was knowledge that it could be proved, and Gulliver had that knowledge, inside his skull, as he walked around the streets. Yet I justified my delay because I had been told to be patient. I had been told to find out exactly who knew. If human progress was to be thwarted, then I needed to be thorough. To kill Gulliver now would have been premature, because his death and that of his mother would be the last acts I could commit before suspicions were aroused. Yes, this is what I told myself, as I unclipped Newton’s lead and re-entered the house, and then accessed that sitting-room computer, typing in the words ‘Poincaré Conjecture’ into the search box. Soon, I found Isobel had been right. This conjecture – concerning a number of very basic topological laws about spheres and four-dimensional space – had been solved by a Russian mathematician called Grigori Perelman. On 18 March 2010 – just over three years ago – it was announced that he had won a Clay Millennium Prize. But he had turned it down, and the million dollars that had gone with it. ‘I’m not interested in money or fame,’ he had said. ‘I don’t want to be on display like an animal in a zoo. I’m not a hero of mathematics.’ This was not the only prize he had been offered. There had been others. A prestigious prize from the European Mathematical Society, one from the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, and the Fields Medal, the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, and the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. All of them he had turned down, choosing instead to live a life of poverty and unemployment, caring for his elderly mother. Humans are arrogant. Humans are greedy. They care about nothing but money and fame. They do not appreciate mathematics for its own sake, but for what it can get them. I logged out. Suddenly, I felt weak. I was hungry. That must have been it. So I went to the kitchen and looked for food. Crunchy wholenut peanut butter I ate some capers, and then a stock cube, and chewed on a stick-like vegetable called celery. Eventually, I got out some bread, a staple of human cuisine, and I looked in the cupboard for something to put on it. Caster sugar was my first option. And then I tried some mixed herbs. Neither was very satisfying. After much anxious trepidation and analysis of the nutritional information I decided to try something called crunchy wholenut peanut butter. I placed it on the bread and gave some to the dog. He liked it. ‘Should I try it?’ I asked him. Yes, you definitely should, appeared to be the response. (Dog words weren’t really words. They were more like melodies. Silent melodies sometimes, but melodies all the same.) It is very tasty indeed. He wasn’t wrong. As I placed it in my mouth and began to chew I realised that human food could actually be quite good. I had never enjoyed food before. Now I came to think of it, I had never enjoyed anything before. And yet today, even amid my strange feelings of weakness and doubt, I had experienced the pleasures of music and of food. And maybe even the simple enjoyment of canine company. After I had eaten one piece of bread and peanut butter I made another one for us both, and then another, Newton’s appetite proving to be at least a match for mine. ‘I am not what I am,’ I told him at one stage. ‘You know that, don’t you? I mean, that is why you were so hostile at first. Why you growled whenever I was near you. You sensed it, didn’t you? More than a human could. You knew there was a difference.’ His silence spoke volumes. And as I stared into his glassy, honest eyes I felt the urge to tell him more. ‘I have killed someone,’ I told him, feeling a sense of relief. ‘I am what a human would categorise as a murderer, a judgemental term, and based in this case on the wrong judgements. You see, sometimes to save something you have to kill a little piece of it. But still, a murderer – that is what they would call me, to kill a little piece of it. But still, a murderer – that is what they would call me, if they knew. Not that they would ever really be able to know how I had done it. ‘You see, as you no doubt know, humans are still at the point in their development where they see a strong difference between the mental and the physical within the same body. They have mental hospitals and body hospitals, as if one doesn’t directly affect the other. And so, if they can’t accept that a mind is directly responsible for the body of the same person, they are hardly likely to understand how a mind – albeit not a human one – can affect the body of someone else. Of course, my skills are not just the product of biology. I have technology, but it is unseen. It is inside me. And now resides in my left hand. It allowed me to take this shape, it enables me to contact my home, and it strengthens my mind. It makes me able to manipulate mental and physical processes. I can perform telekinesis – look, look right now, look what I am doing with the lid of the peanut butter jar – and also something very close to hypnosis. You see, where I am from everything is seamless. Minds, bodies, technologies all come together in a quite beautiful convergence.’ The phone rang at that point. It had rung earlier too. I didn’t answer it though. There were some tastes, just as there were some songs by the Beach Boys (‘In My Room’, ‘God Only Knows’, ‘Sloop John B’) that were just too good to disturb. But then the peanut butter ran out, and Newton and I stared at each other in mutual mourning. ‘I am sorry, Newton. But it appears we have run out of peanut butter.’ This cannot be true. You must be mistaken. Check again. I checked again. ‘No, I am not mistaken.’ Properly. Check properly. That was just a glance. I checked properly. I even showed him the inside of the jar. He was still disbelieving, so I placed the jar right up next to his nose, which was clearly where he wanted it. Ah, you see, there is still some. Look. Look. And he licked the contents of the jar until he too had to eventually agree we were out of the stuff. I laughed out loud. I had never laughed. It was a very odd feeling, but not unpleasant. And then we went and sat on the sofa in the living room. Why are you here? I don’t know if the dog’s eyes were asking me this, but I gave him an answer anyway. ‘I am here to destroy information. Information that exists in the bodies of certain machines and the minds of certain humans. That is my purpose. Although, obviously, while I am here I am also collecting information. Just how volatile are they? How violent? How dangerous to themselves and others? Are their flaws – and there do seem to be quite a few – insurmountable? Or is there hope? These questions are the sort I have in mind, even if I am not supposed to. hope? These questions are the sort I have in mind, even if I am not supposed to. First and foremost though, what I am doing involves elimination.’ Newton looked at me bleakly, but he didn’t judge. And we stayed there, on that purple sofa, for quite a while. Something was happening to me, I realised, and it had been happening ever since Debussy and the Beach Boys. I wished I’d never played them. For ten minutes we sat in silence. This mournful mood only altered with the distraction of the front door opening and closing. It was Gulliver. He waited silently in the hallway for a moment or two, and then hung up his coat and dropped his schoolbag. He came into the living room, walking slowly. He didn’t make eye contact. ‘Don’t tell Mum, okay?’ ‘What?’ I said. ‘Don’t tell her what?’ He was awkward. ‘That I wasn’t at school.’ ‘Okay. I won’t.’ He looked at Newton, whose head was back on my lap. He seemed confused but didn’t comment. He turned to go upstairs. ‘What were you doing by the train track?’ I asked him. I saw his hands tense up. ‘What?’ ‘You were just standing there, as the train passed.’ ‘You followed me?’ ‘Yes. Yes, I did. I followed you. I wasn’t going to tell you. In fact, I am surprising myself by telling you now. But my innate curiosity won out.’ He answered with a kind of muted groan, and headed upstairs. After a while, with a dog on your lap, you realise there is a necessity to stroke it. Don’t ask me how this necessarily comes about. It clearly has something to do with the dimensions of the human upper body. Anyway, I stroked the dog and as I did so I realised it was actually a pleasant feeling, the warmth and the rhythm of it. Isobel’s dance Eventually, Isobel came back. I shifted along the sofa to reach such a position that I could witness her walking in through the front door. Just to see the simple effort of it – the physical pushing of the door, the extraction of the key, the closing of the door and the placing of that key (and the others it was attached to) in a small oval basket on a static piece of wooden furniture – all of that was quite mesmerising to me. The way she did such things in single gliding movements, almost dancelike, without thinking about them. I should have been looking down on such things. But I wasn’t. She seemed to be continually operating above the task she was doing. A melody, rising above rhythm. Yet she was still what she was, a human. She walked down the hallway, exhaling the whole way, her face containing both a smile and a frown at once. Like her son, she was confused to see the dog lying on my lap. And equally confused when she saw the dog jump off my lap and run over to her. ‘What’s with Newton?’ she asked. ‘With him?’ ‘He seems lively.’ ‘Does he?’ ‘Yes. And, I don’t know, his eyes seem brighter.’ ‘Oh. It might have been the peanut butter. And the music.’ ‘Peanut butter? Music? You never listen to music. Have you been listening to music?’ ‘Yes. We have.’ She looked at me with suspicion. ‘Right. I see.’ ‘We’ve been listening to music all day long.’ ‘How are you feeling? I mean, you know, about Daniel.’ ‘Oh, it is very sad,’ I said. ‘How was your day?’ She sighed. ‘It was okay.’ This was a lie, I could tell that. I looked at her. My eyes could stay on her with ease, I noticed. What had happened? Was this another side-effect of the music?I suppose I was getting acclimatised to her, and to humans in general. Physically, at least from the outside, I was one too. It was becoming a new normality, in a sense. Yet even so, my stomach churned far less with her than with the sight of the others I saw walking past the window, peering in at me. In fact, that day, or at that point in that day, it didn’t churn at all. ‘I feel like I should phone Tabitha,’ she said. ‘It’s difficult though, isn’t it? She’ll be inundated. I might just send her an email and let her know, you know, if there’s anything we can do.’ I nodded. ‘That’s a good idea.’ She studied me for a while. ‘Yes,’ she said, at a lower frequency. ‘I think so.’ She looked at the phone. ‘Has anyone called?’ ‘I think so. The phone rang a few times.’ ‘But you didn’t pick it up?’ ‘No. No, I didn’t. I don’t really feel up to lengthy conversations. And I feel cursed at the moment. The last time I had a lengthy conversation with anyone who wasn’t you or Gulliver they ended up dying in front of me.’ ‘Don’t say it like that.’ ‘Like what?’ ‘Flippantly. It’s a sad day.’ ‘I know,’ I said. ‘I just . . . it hasn’t sunk in yet, really.’ She went away to listen to the messages. She came back. ‘Lots of people have been calling you.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘Who?’ ‘Your mother. But be warned, she might be doing her trademark oppressive- worry thing. She’s heard about your little event at Corpus. I don’t know how. The college called, too, wanting to speak, doing a good job of sounding concerned. A journalist from the Cambridge Evening News. And Ari. Being sweet. He wonders if you’d be up to going to a football match on Saturday. Someone else, too.’ She paused for a moment. ‘She said her name was Maggie.’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said, faking it. ‘Of course. Maggie.’ Then she raised her eyebrows at me. It meant something, clearly, but I had no idea what. It was frustrating. You see, the Language of Words was only one of the human languages. There were many others, as I have pointed out. The Language of Sighs, the Language of Silent Moments and, most significantly, the Language of Frowns. Then she did the opposite, her eyebrows going as low as they could. She sighed and went into the kitchen. ‘What have you been doing with the caster sugar?’ ‘What have you been doing with the caster sugar?’ ‘Eating it,’ I said. ‘It was a mistake. Sorry.’ ‘Well, you know, feel free to put things back.’ ‘I forgot. Sorry.’ ‘It’s okay. It’s just been a day and a half, that’s all.’ I nodded and tried to act human. ‘What do you want me to do? I mean, what should I do?’ ‘Well, you could start by calling your mother. But don’t tell her about the hospital. I know what you’re like.’ ‘What? What am I like?’ ‘You tell her more than you tell me.’ Now that was worrying. That was very worrying indeed. I decided to phone her right away. The mother Remarkable as it may sound, the mother was an important concept for humans. Not only were they truly aware who their mother was, but in many cases they also kept in contact with them throughout their lives. Of course, for someone like me, whose mother was never there to be known this was a very exotic idea. So exotic, I was scared to pursue it. But I did, because if her son had told her too much information, I obviously needed to know. ‘Andrew?’ ‘Yes, Mother. It is me.’ ‘Oh Andrew.’ She spoke at a high frequency. The highest I had ever heard. ‘Hello, Mother.’ ‘Andrew, me and your father have been worried sick about you.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘I had a little episode. I temporarily lost my mind. I forgot to put on my clothes. That’s all.’ ‘Is that all you have to say?’ ‘No. No, it isn’t. I have to ask you a question, Mother. It is an important question.’ ‘Oh, Andrew. What is the matter?’ ‘The matter? Which matter?’ ‘Is it Isobel? Has she been nagging you again? Is that what this is about?’ ‘Again?’ The static crackle of a sigh. ‘Yes. You’ve told us for over a year now that you and Isobel have been having difficulties. That she’s not been as understanding as she could have been about your workload. That she’s not been there for you.’ I thought of Isobel, lying about her day to stop me worrying, making me food, stroking my skin. ‘No,’ I said. ‘She is there for him. Me.’ ‘And Gulliver? What about him? I thought she’d turned him against you. Because of that band he wanted to be in. But you were right, darling. He shouldn’t be messing around in bands. Not after all that he’s done.’ ‘Band? I don’t know, Mother. I don’t think it is that.’ ‘Band? I don’t know, Mother. I don’t think it is that.’ ‘Why are you calling me Mother? You never call me Mother.’ ‘But you are my mother. What do I call you?’ ‘Mum. You call me Mum.’ ‘Mum,’ I said. It sounded the most strange of all the strange words. ‘Mum. Mum. Mum. Mum. Mum, listen, I want to know if I spoke to you recently.’ She wasn’t listening. ‘We wish we were there.’ ‘Come over,’ I said. I was interested to see what she looked like. ‘Come over right now.’ ‘Well, if we didn’t live twelve thousand miles away.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. Twelve thousand miles didn’t sound like much. ‘Come over this afternoon then.’ The mother laughed. ‘Still got your sense of humour.’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I am still very funny. Listen, did I speak to you last Saturday?’ ‘No. Andrew, have you lost your memory? Is this amnesia? You’re acting like you have amnesia.’ ‘I’m a bit confused. That’s all. It’s not amnesia. The doctors told me that. It’s just . . . I have been working hard.’ ‘Yes, yes, I know. You told us.’ ‘So, what did I tell you?’ ‘That you’ve hardly been sleeping. That you’ve been working harder than you ever have, at least since your PhD.’ And then she started giving me information I hadn’t asked for. She started talking about her hipbone. It was causing her a lot of pain. She was on pain relief medication but it wasn’t working. I found the conversation disconcerting and even nauseating. The idea of prolonged pain was quite alien to me. Humans considered themselves to be quite medically advanced but they had yet to solve this problem in any meaningful way. Just as they had yet to solve the problem of death. ‘Mother. Mum, listen, what do you know about the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘That’s the thing you’re working on, isn’t it?’ ‘Working on? Working on. Yes. I am still working on it. And I will never prove it. I realise that now.’ ‘Oh, all right, darling. Well, don’t beat yourself up about it. Now, listen . . .’ Pretty soon she was back to talking about the pain again. She said the doctor had told her she should get a hip replacement. It would be made of titanium. I almost gasped when she said that but I didn’t want to tell her about titanium, as the humans obviously didn’t know about that yet. They would find out in their own time. Then she started talking about my ‘father’ and how his memory was getting Then she started talking about my ‘father’ and how his memory was getting worse. The doctor had told him not to drive any more and that it looked increasingly unlikely that he would be able to finish the book on macroeconomic theory he had been hoping to get published. ‘It makes me worry about you, Andrew. You know, only last week I told you what the doctor had said, about how I should advise you to get a brain scan. It can run in families.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. I really didn’t know what else was required of me. The truth was that I wanted the conversation to end. I had obviously not told my parents. Or I hadn’t told my mother, at any rate, and from the sound of things my father’s brain was such that it would probably lose any information I had given him. Also, and it was a big also, the conversation was depressing me. It was making me think about human life in a way I didn’t want to think about it. Human life, I realised, got progressively worse as you got older, by the sound of things. You arrived, with baby feet and hands and infinite happiness, and then the happiness slowly evaporated as your feet and hands grew bigger. And then, from the teenage years onwards, happiness was something you could lose your grip of, and once it started to slip it gained mass. It was as if the knowledge that it could slip was the thing that made it more difficult to hold, no matter how big your feet and hands were. Why was this depressing? Why did I care, when it was not my job to do so? Again I felt immense gratitude that I only looked like a human being and would never actually be one. She carried on talking. And as she did so I realised there could be no cosmic consequence at all if I stopped listening, and with that realisation I switched off the phone. I closed my eyes, wanting to see nothing but I did see something. I saw Tabitha, leaning over her husband as aspirin froth slid out of his mouth. I wondered if my mother was the same age as Tabitha, or older. When I opened my eyes again I realised Newton was standing there, looking up at me. His eyes told me he was confused. Why did you not say goodbye? You usually say goodbye. And then, bizarrely, I did something I didn’t understand. Something which had absolutely no logic to it at all. I picked up the phone and dialled the same number. After three rings she answered, and then I spoke. ‘Sorry, Mum. I meant to say goodbye.’ Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Are you there? We can hear you. We are here. Listen, it’s safe. The information is destroyed. For now, the humans will remain at level three. There is no worry. You have destroyed all the evidence, and all possible sources? I have destroyed the information on Andrew Martin’s computer, and on Daniel Russell’s computer. Daniel Russell is destroyed, also. Heart attack. He was a heart-risk, so that was the most logical cause of death in the circumstances. Have you destroyed Isobel Martin and Gulliver Martin? No. No, I haven’t. There is no need to destroy them. They do not know? Gulliver Martin knows. Isobel Martin doesn’t. But Gulliver has no motivation to say anything. You must destroy him. You must destroy both of them. No. There is no need. If you want me to, if you really think it is required, then I can manipulate his neurological processes. I can make him forget what his father told him. Not that he really knows anyway. He has no real understanding of mathematics. The effects of any mind manipulation you carry out disappear the moment you return home. You know that. He won’t say anything. He might have said something already. Humans aren’t to be trusted. They don’t even trust themselves. Gulliver hasn’t said anything. And Isobel knows nothing. You must complete your task. If you do not complete your task, someone else will be sent to complete it for you. No. No. I will complete it. Don’t worry. I will complete my task. PART II I held a jewel in my fingers – Richard Feynman – David Foster Wallace – Carl Sagan You can’t say A is made of B or vice versa. All mass is interaction. We’re all lonely for something we don’t know we’re lonely for. For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. Sleepwalking I stood next to his bed while he slept. I don’t know how long I just stood there, in the dark, listening to his deep breathing as he slipped deeper and deeper below dreams. Half an hour, maybe. He hadn’t pulled the window blind down, so I looked out at the night. There was no moon from this angle, but I could see a few stars. Suns lighting dead solar systems elsewhere in the galaxy. Everywhere you can see in their sky, or almost everywhere, is lifeless. That must affect them. That must give them ideas above their station. That must send them insane. Gulliver rolled over, and I decided to wait no longer. It was now or it was never. You will pull back your duvet, I told him, in a voice he wouldn’t have heard if he had been awake but which reached right in, riding theta-waves, to become a command from his own brain. And slowly you will sit up in your bed, your feet will be on the rug and you will breathe and you will compose yourself and then you will stand up. And he did, indeed, stand up. He stayed there, breathing deeply and slowly, waiting for the next command. You will walk to the door. Do not worry about opening the door, because it is already open. There. Just walk, just walk, just walk to your door. He did exactly as I said. And he was there in the doorway, oblivious to everything except my voice. A voice which only had two words that needed to be said. Fall forward. I moved closer to him. Somehow those words were slow to arrive. I needed time. Another minute, at least. I was there, closer, able to smell the scent of sleep on him. Of humanity. And I remembered: You must complete your task. If you do not complete your task, someone else will be sent to complete it for you. I swallowed. My mouth was so dry it hurt. I felt the infinite expanse of the universe behind me, a vast if neutral force. The neutrality of time, of space, of mathematics, of logic, of survival. I closed my eyes. Waited. Waited. Before I opened them, I was being gripped by the throat. I could barely breathe. He had turned 180 degrees, and his left hand had me by the neck. I pulled it away, and now both his hands were fists swinging at me, wild, angry, hitting me almost as much as he missed. He got the side of my head. I walked backwards away from him, but he was moving forwards at just the same speed. His eyes were open. He was seeing me now. Seeing me and not seeing me all at the same time. I could have said stop of course, but I didn’t. Maybe I wanted to witness some human violence first-hand, even unconscious violence, to understand the importance of my task. By understanding it I would be able to fulfil it. Yes, that might have been it. That may also have explained why I let myself bleed when he punched me on the nose. I had reached his desk now and could retreat no further, so I just stood there as he kept hitting my head, my neck, my chest, my arms. He roared now, his mouth as wide as it could go, baring teeth. ‘Raaaah!’ This roar woke him up. His legs went weak and he nearly fell to the floor but he recovered in time. ‘I,’ he said. He didn’t know where he was for a moment. He saw me, in the dark, and this time it was conscious sight. ‘Dad?’ I nodded as a slow thin stream of blood reached my mouth. Isobel was running up the stairs to the attic. ‘What’s going on?’ ‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘I heard a noise so I came upstairs. Gulliver was sleepwalking, that’s all.’ Isobel switched the light on, gasped as she saw my face. ‘You’re bleeding.’ ‘It’s nothing. He didn’t know what he was doing.’ ‘Gulliver?’ Gulliver was sitting on the edge of his bed now, flinching from the light. He too looked at my face but he didn’t say anything at all. I was a wasn’t Gulliver wanted to go back to bed. To sleep. So, ten minutes later, Isobel and I were alone, and I was sitting on the side of the bath as she placed an antiseptic solution called TCP on a circle of cotton wool and dabbed it gently on a cut on my forehead, and then on my lip. Now, these were wounds I could have healed with a single thought. Just to feel pain, sometimes, was enough to cancel it. And yet, even as the antiseptic stung on contact with each cut, the injuries stayed. I forced them to. I couldn’t allow her to get suspicious. But was it just that? ‘How’s your nose?’ she asked. I caught sight of it in the mirror. A smear of blood around one nostril. ‘It’s okay,’ I said, feeling it. ‘It isn’t broken.’ Her eyes squinted in pure concentration. ‘This one on your forehead is really bad. And there’s going to be one giant bruise there. He must have really hit you hard. Did you try and restrain him?’ ‘Yes,’ I lied. ‘I did. But he kept on.’ I could smell her. Clean, human smells. The smells of the creams she used to wash and moisturise her face. The smell of her shampoo. A delicate trace of ammonia barely competing with the heavy scent of antiseptic. She was physically closer to me than she had ever been. I looked at her neck. She had two little dark moles on it, close together, charting unknown binary stars. I thought of Andrew Martin kissing her. This was what humans did. They kissed. Like so many human things, it made no sense. Or maybe, if you tried it, the logic would unfold. ‘Did he say anything?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘No. He just yelled. It was very primal.’ ‘I don’t know, between you and him, it never ends.’ ‘What never ends?’ ‘The worry.’ She placed the blood-stained cotton wool in the small bin beside the sink. ‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry for everything. For the past and the future.’ An ‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry for everything. For the past and the future.’ An apology, said while in dull pain, made me feel as close to human as it was possible to feel. I could almost have written a poem. We went back to bed. She held my hand in the dark. I gently pulled it away. ‘We’ve lost him,’ she said. It took me a moment to realise she was talking about Gulliver. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘maybe we just have to accept him as he is, even if he’s different to what we’ve known.’ ‘I just don’t understand him. You know, he’s our son. And we’ve known him for sixteen years. And yet, I feel like I don’t know him at all.’ ‘Well, maybe we should try not to understand so much, and accept some more.’ ‘That’s a very difficult thing. And a very strange thing to come from your mouth, Andrew.’ ‘So, I suppose the next question is: what about me? Do you understand me?’ ‘I don’t think you understand yourself, Andrew.’ I wasn’t Andrew. I knew I wasn’t Andrew. But equally, I was losing myself. I was a wasn’t, that was the problem. I was lying in bed with a human woman I could now almost appreciate as beautiful, wilfully still feeling the sting of antiseptic in my wounds, and thinking of her strange but fascinating skin, and the way she had cared for me. No one in the universe cared for me. (You didn’t did you?) We had technology to care for us now, and we didn’t need emotions. We were alone. We worked together for our preservation but emotionally we needed no one. We just needed the purity of mathematical truth. And yet, I was scared of falling asleep, because the moment I fell asleep my wounds would heal and right then I didn’t want that to happen. Right then, I found a strange but real comfort in the pain. I had so many worries now. So many questions. ‘Do you believe humans are ever knowable?’ I asked. ‘I wrote a book on Charlemagne. I hope so.’ ‘But humans, in their natural state, are they good or are they bad, would you say? Can they be trusted? Or is their own real state just violence and greed and cruelty?’ ‘Well, that’s the oldest question there is.’ ‘What do you think?’ ‘I’m tired, Andrew. I’m sorry.’ ‘Yes, me too. I’ll see you in the morning.’ ‘Night.’ ‘Night.’ I stayed awake for a while as Isobel slipped towards sleep. The trouble was, I I stayed awake for a while as Isobel slipped towards sleep. The trouble was, I still wasn’t used to the night. It may not have been as dark as I first thought it to be. There was moonlight, starlight, airglow, streetlamps, and sunlight backscattered by interplanetary dust, but the humans still spent half their time in deep shadow. This, I was sure, was one of the chief reasons for personal and sexual relationships here. The need to find comfort in the dark. And it was a comfort, being next to her. So I just stayed there, hearing her breath move in and out, sounding like the tide of some exotic sea. At some point my little finger touched hers, in the double-night beneath the duvet, and this time I kept it there and imagined I was really what she thought I was. And that we were connected. Two humans, primitive enough to truly care about each other. It was a comforting thought, and the one which led me down those ever-darkening stairs of the mind towards sleep. I may need more time. You do not need time. I am going to kill who I need to kill, don’t worry about that. We are not worried. But I am not just here to destroy information. I am here to gather it. That is what you said, wasn’t it? Stuff on mathematical understanding can be read across the universe, I know that. I’m not talking about neuro-flashes. I’m talking about stuff that can only be picked up on from here, on Earth itself. To give us more insight into how the humans live. It has been a long time since anyone was here, at least in human terms. Explain why you need more time for this. Complexity demands time, but humans are primitives. They are the most shallow of mysteries. No. You are wrong. They exist simultaneously in two worlds – the world of appearances and the world of truth. The connecting strands between these worlds take many forms. When I first arrived here I did not understand certain things. For instance, I did not understand why clothes were so important. Or why a dead cow became beef, or why grass cut a certain way demanded not to be walked upon, or why household pets were so important to them. The humans are scared of nature, and are greatly reassured when they can prove to themselves they have mastery over it. This is why lawns exist, and why wolves evolved into dogs, and why their architecture is based on unnatural shapes. But, really, nature, pure nature is just a symbol to them. A symbol of human nature. They are interchangeable. So what I am saying— What are you saying? What I am saying is that it takes time to understand humans because they don’t understand themselves. They have been wearing clothes for so long. Metaphorical clothes. That is what I am talking about. That was the price of human civilisation – to create it they had to close the door on their true selves. human civilisation – to create it they had to close the door on their true selves. And so they are lost, that is how I understand it. And that is why they invented art: books, music, films, plays, painting, sculpture. They invented them as bridges back to themselves, back to who they are. But however close they get they are for ever removed. What I am saying, I suppose, is that last night I was about to kill the boy. Gulliver. He was about to fall down the stairs in his sleep but then his true nature came out and he attacked me. Attacked you with what? With himself. With his arms. His hands. He was still asleep but his eyes were open. He attacked me, or the me he thinks I am. His father. And it was pure rage. The humans are violent. That is not news. No, I know. I know. But he woke, and he wasn’t violent. That is the battle they have. And I believe if we understand human nature a little more, then we will know better what action to take in the future, when other advances are made. In the future, when another over-population crisis arises there may come a time when Earth becomes a valid option for our species. So, surely as much knowledge as possible on human psychology and society and behaviour is going to help? They are defined by greed. Not all of them. For instance, there is a mathematician called Grigori Perelman. He turned down money and prizes. He looks after his mother. We have a distorted view. I think it would be useful for all of us if I researched further. But you don’t need the two humans for that. Oh, I do. Why? Because they think they know who I am. And I have a true chance of seeing them. The real them. Behind the walls they have built for themselves. And speaking of walls, Gulliver knows nothing now. I cancelled his knowledge of what his father told him on his last night. While I am here, there is no danger. You must act soon. You don’t have for ever. I know. Don’t worry. I won’t need for ever. They must die. Yes. Wider than the sky ‘It was sleep psychosis,’ Isobel told Gulliver at breakfast the next day. ‘It’s very common. Lots of people have had it. Lots of perfectly normal and sane people. Like that man from R.E.M. He had it, and he was meant to be as nice as rock stars come.’ She hadn’t seen me. I had just entered the kitchen. But now she noticed my presence and was puzzled by the sight of me. ‘Your face,’ she said. ‘Last night there were cuts and bruises. It’s totally healed.’ ‘Must have been better than it looked. The night might exaggerate things.’ ‘Yes, but even so—’ She glanced at her son, struggling uneasily with his cereal, and decided not to go on. ‘You might need the day off school, Gulliver,’ said Isobel. I expected him to agree to this, seeing that he preferred an education that involved staring at rail-tracks. But he looked at me, considered for a moment, and concluded, ‘No. No. It’s okay. I feel fine.’ Later, it was just me and Newton in the house. I was still ‘recovering’, you see. Recover. The most human of words, the implication being that healthy normal life is covering something – the violence that is there underneath, the violence I had seen in Gulliver the night before. To be healthy meant to be covered. Clothed. Literally and metaphorically. Yet I needed to find what lay beneath, something that would satisfy the hosts and justify the delay I was taking in my task. I discovered a pile of paper, tied with an elastic band. It was in Isobel’s wardrobe, hidden among all those essential clothes, yellowing with age. I sniffed the page and guessed at least a decade. The top sheet had the words ‘Wider than the Sky’ on them, along with these ones: ‘A novel by Isobel Martin’. A novel? I read a little bit of it and realised that although the central character’s name was Charlotte, she could just as easily have been called Isobel. Charlotte heard herself sigh: a tired old machine, releasing pressure. Charlotte heard herself sigh: a tired old machine, releasing pressure. Everything weighed down on her. The small rituals of her daily existence – filling the dishwasher, picking up from school, cooking – had all been performed as if underwater. The mutual energy reserves shared by a mother and her child had now, she conceded, been monopolised by Oliver. He had been running wild since she had picked him up from school, firing that blue alien blaster or whatever it was. She didn’t know why her mother had bought it. Actually, she did know. To prove a point. ‘Five-year-old boys want to play with guns, Charlotte. It’s only natural. You can’t deprive them of their nature.’ ‘Die! Die! Die!’ Charlotte closed the oven door and set the timer. She turned around to see Oliver pointing the massive blue gun up at her face. ‘No, Oliver,’ she said, too tired to battle the abstract anger clouding his features. ‘Don’t shoot Mummy.’ He maintained his pose, fired cheap electric fairground sounds a few more times, then ran out of the kitchen, through the hallway, and noisily exterminated invisible aliens as he charged up the stairs. She remembered the quiet echoing babble of university corridors and realised that missing it was a kind of pain. She wanted to return, to teach again, but she worried she may have left it too late. Maternity leave had stretched into permanent leave, and the belief had grown that she could be fulfilled as a wife and mother, a historical archetype, ‘keeping her feet on the ground’, as her mother always advised, while her high-flying husband made sure he didn’t dip beneath the clouds. Charlotte shook her head in theatrical exasperation, as if she were being observed by an audience of stern-faced mother-watchers examining her progress and making notes on clipboards. She was often aware of the self-conscious nature of her parenting, the way she had to create a role outside of herself, a part already plotted out for her. Don’t shoot Mummy. She squatted down and looked through the oven door. The lasagne would be another forty-five minutes and Jonathan still wasn’t back from his conference. She raised herself back up and went into the living room. The wobbly glass of the drinks cabinet glinted, shining like a false promise. She turned the old key and opened the door. A mini metropolis of spirit bottles bathed in dark shadow. She reached for the Empire State, the Bombay Sapphire, and poured out her evening allowance. Jonathan. Late last Thursday. Late this Thursday. She acknowledged this fact as she slumped down on the settee, but did not get too close to it. Her husband was a mystery she no longer had the energy to unravel. Anyway, it was known to be the first rule of marriage: solve the mystery, end the love. So, families often stayed together. Wives sometimes managed to stay with husbands and put up with whichever misery they felt by writing novels and hiding them at the bottom of their wardrobes. Mothers put up with their children, no matter how difficult those children were, no matter how close to insanity they pushed their parents. Anyway, I stopped reading there. I felt it was an intrusion. A bit rich, I know, from someone who was living inside her husband’s identity. I put it back in its place in the wardrobe underneath the clothes. Later on, I told her what I had found. She gave me an unreadable look, and her cheeks went red. I didn’t know if it She gave me an unreadable look, and her cheeks went red. I didn’t know if it was a blush or anger. Maybe it was a little of both. ‘That was private. You weren’t ever supposed to see that.’ ‘I know. That is why I wanted to see it. I want to understand you.’ ‘Why? There’s no academic glory or million-dollar prize if you solve me, Andrew. You shouldn’t go snooping around.’ ‘Shouldn’t a husband know a wife?’ ‘That really is quite rich coming from you.’ ‘What does that mean?’ She sighed. ‘Nothing. Nothing. Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.’ ‘You should say whatever you feel you should say.’ ‘Good policy. But I think that would mean we’d have divorced around 2002, at a conservative estimate.’ ‘Well? Maybe you would have been happier if you had divorced him, I mean me, in 2002.’ ‘Well, we’ll never know.’ ‘No.’ And the phone rang. It was someone for me. ‘Hello?’ A man spoke. His voice was casual, familiar, but there was a curiosity there, too. ‘Hey, it’s me. Ari.’ ‘Oh, hello Ari.’ I knew Ari was supposed to be my closest friend, so I tried to sound friend-like. ‘How are you? How’s your marriage?’ Isobel looked at me with an emphatic frown, but I don’t think he’d heard properly. ‘Well, just got back from that thing in Edinburgh.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, trying to pretend I knew what ‘that thing in Edinburgh’ was. ‘Right. Yes. That thing in Edinburgh. Of course. How was that?’ ‘It was good. Yeah, it was good. Caught up with the St Andrews lot. Listen, mate, I hear it’s been a bit of a week for you.’ ‘Yes. It has. It has been a lot of a week for me.’ ‘So I wasn’t sure if you’d still be up for the football?’ ‘The football?’ ‘Cambridge–Kettering. We could have a pint of mild and a bit of a chat, about that top secret thing you told me the last time we spoke.’ ‘Secret?’ Every molecule of me was now alert. ‘What secret?’ ‘Don’t think I should broadcast it.’ ‘No. No. You’re right. Don’t say it out loud. In fact, don’t tell anyone.’ Isobel was now in the hallway, looking at me with suspicion. ‘But to answer you, yes, I will go to the football.’ And I pressed the red button on the phone, weary at the probability that I would have to switch another human life into non-existence. A few seconds of silence over breakfast You become something else. A different species. That is the easy bit. That is simple molecular rearrangement. Our inner technology can do that, without a problem, with the correct commands and model to work from. There are no new ingredients in the universe, and humans – however they may look – are made of roughly the same things we are. The difficulty, though, is the other stuff. The stuff that happens when you look in the bathroom mirror and see this new you and don’t want to throw up into the sink at the sight of yourself like you have wanted to every other morning. And when you wear clothes, and you realise it is starting to feel like quite a normal thing to do. And when you walk downstairs and see the life form that is meant to be your son eating toast, listening to music only he can hear, it takes you a second – or two, three, four seconds – to realise that, actually, this is not your son. He means nothing to you. Not only that: he has to mean nothing to you. Also, your wife. Your wife is not your wife. Your wife who loves you but doesn’t really like you, because of something you never did, but which couldn’t be any worse, from her perspective, than the something you’re going to do. She is an alien. She is as alien as they come. A primate whose nearest evolutionary cousins are hairy tree-dwelling knuckle draggers known as chimpanzees. And yet, when everything is alien the alien becomes familiar, and you can judge her as humans judge her. You can watch her when she drinks her pink grapefruit juice, and stares at her son with worried, helpless eyes. You can see that for her being a parent is standing on a shore and watching her child in a vulnerable craft, heading out over deeper and deeper water, hoping but not knowing there will be land somewhere ahead. And you can see her beauty. If beauty on Earth is the same as elsewhere: ideal in that it is tantalising and unsolvable, creating a delicious kind of confusion. I was confused. I was lost. I wished I had a new wound, just so she could attend to me. ‘What are you looking at?’ she asked me. ‘What are you looking at?’ she asked me. ‘You,’ I said. She looked at Gulliver. He couldn’t hear us. Then she looked back at me, as confused as myself. We are worried. What are you doing? I told you. Well? I am accumulating information. You are wasting time. I’m not. I know what I am doing. It was never meant to take this long. I know. But I am learning more about the humans. They are more complicated than we first thought. They are sometimes violent, but more often care about each other. There is more goodness in them than anything else, I am convinced of it. What are you saying? I don’t know what I am saying. I am confused. Some things have stopped making sense. This happens, occasionally, on a new planet. The perspective changes to that of its inhabitants. But our perspective has not changed. Do you understand that? Yes. I do understand. Stay pure. I will. Life/death/football Humans are one of the few intelligent beings in the galaxy who haven’t quite solved the problem of death. And yet they don’t spend their whole lives screeching and howling in terror, clawing at their own bodies, or rolling around on the floor. Some humans do that – I saw them in the hospital – but those humans are considered the mad ones. Now, consider this. A human life is on average 80 Earth years or around 30,000 Earth days. Which means they are born, they make some friends, eat a few meals, they get married, or they don’t get married, have a child or two, or not, drink a few thousand glasses of wine, have sexual intercourse a few times, discover a lump somewhere, feel a bit of regret, wonder where all the time went, know they should have done it differently, realise they would have done it the same, and then they die. Into the great black nothing. Out of space. Out of time. The most trivial of trivial zeroes. And that’s it, the full caboodle. All confined to the same mediocre planet. But at ground level the humans don’t appear to spend their entire lives in a catatonic state. No. They do other things. Things like: – washing – listening – gardening – eating – driving – working – yearning – earning – staring – drinking – sighing – sighing – reading – gaming – sunbathing – complaining – jogging – quibbling – caring – mingling – fantasising – googling – parenting – renovating – loving – dancing – fucking – regretting – failing – striving – hoping – sleeping Oh, and sport. Apparently I, or rather Andrew, liked sport. And the sport he liked was football. Luckily for Professor Andrew Martin, the football team he supported was Cambridge United, one of those which successfully avoided the perils and existential trauma of victory. To support Cambridge United, I discovered, was to support the idea of failure. To watch a team’s feet consistently avoid the spherical Earth-symbol seemed to frustrate their supporters greatly, but they obviously wouldn’t have it any other way. The truth is, you see, however much they would beg to disagree, humans don’t actually like to win. Or rather, they like winning for ten seconds but if they keep on winning they end up actually having to think about other things, like life and death. The only thing humans like less than winning is losing, but at least something can be done about that. With absolute winning, there is nothing to be done. They just have to deal with it. Now, I was there at the game to see Cambridge United play against a team called Kettering. I had asked Gulliver if he wanted to come with me – so I could keep Kettering. I had asked Gulliver if he wanted to come with me – so I could keep an eye on him – and he had said, with sarcasm, ‘Yeah, Dad, you know me so well.’ So, it was just me and Ari, or to give him his full title Professor Arirumadhi Arasaratham. As I have said, this was Andrew’s closest friend, although I had learnt from Isobel that I didn’t really have friends as such. More acquaintances. Anyway, Ari was an ‘expert’ (human definition) on theoretical physics. He was also quite rotund, as if he didn’t just want to watch football but become one. ‘So,’ he said, during a period when Cambridge United didn’t have the ball (that is to say, any time during the match), ‘how are things?’ ‘Things?’ He stuffed some crisps into his mouth and made no attempt to conceal their fate. ‘You know, I was a bit worried about you.’ He laughed. It was the laugh human males do, to hide emotion. ‘Well, I say worry, it was more mild concern. I say mild concern but it was more ‘wonder if he’s done a Nash?’’ ‘What do you mean?’ He told me what he meant. Apparently human mathematicians have a habit of going mad. He gave me a list of names – Nash, Cantor, Gödel, Turing – and I nodded along as if they meant something. And then he said ‘Riemann.’ ‘Riemann?’ ‘I heard you weren’t eating much so I was thinking more Gödel than Riemann, actually,’ he said. By Gödel, I later learnt, he meant Kurt Gödel, another German mathematician. However, this one’s particular psychological quirk was that he had believed everyone was trying to poison his food. So he had stopped eating altogether. By that definition of madness, Ari appeared very sane indeed. ‘No. I haven’t done one of those. I am eating now. Peanut butter sandwiches mainly.’ ‘Sounds like more of a Presley,’ he said, laughing. And then he gave me a serious look. I could tell it was serious because he had swallowed and wasn’t putting any more food in his mouth. ‘Because, you know, prime numbers are fucking serious, man. Some serious shit. They can make you lose it. They’re like sirens. They call you in with their isolated beauty and before you know it you are in some major mind-shit. And when I heard about your naked corpus at Corpus I thought you were cracking up a bit.’ ‘No. I am on the rails,’ I said. ‘Like a train. Or a clothes-hanger.’ ‘And Isobel? Everything fine with you and Isobel?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘She is my wife. And I love her. Everything is fine. Fine.’ He frowned at me. Then he took a moment’s glance to see if Cambridge United were anywhere near the ball. He seemed relieved to see they weren’t. United were anywhere near the ball. He seemed relieved to see they weren’t. ‘Really? Everything’s fine?’ I could see he needed more confirmation. ‘Till I loved I never lived.’ He shook his head and gave a facial expression I can now safely classify as bewilderment. ‘What’s that? Shakespeare? Tennyson? Marvell?’ I shook my head. ‘No. It was Emily Dickinson. I have been reading a lot of her poetry. And also Anne Sexton’s. And Walt Whitman too. Poetry seems to say a lot about us. You know, us humans.’ ‘Emily Dickinson? You’re quoting Emily Dickinson at a match?’ ‘Yes.’ I sensed, again, I was getting the context wrong. Everything here was about context. There was nothing that was right for every occasion. I didn’t get it. The air always had hydrogen in it wherever you were. But that was pretty much the only consistent thing. What was the big difference that made quoting love poetry inappropriate in this context? I had no idea. ‘Right,’ he said, and paused for the large, communal groan as Kettering scored a goal. I groaned too. Groaning was actually quite diverting, and certainly the most enjoyable aspect of sport spectating. I might have overdone it a little bit though, judging from the looks I was getting. Or maybe they had seen me on the Internet. ‘Okay,’ he said. ‘And what does Isobel feel about everything?’ ‘Everything?’ ‘You, Andrew. What does she think? Does she know about . . . you know? Is that what triggered it?’ This was my moment. I inhaled. ‘The secret I told you?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘About the Riemann hypothesis?’ He scrunched his face in confusion. ‘What? No, man. Unless you’ve been sleeping with a hypothesis on the side?’ ‘So what was the secret?’ ‘That you’re having it away with a student.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, feeling relief. ‘So I definitely didn’t say anything about work the last time I saw you.’ ‘No. For once, you didn’t.’ He turned back to the football. ‘So, are you going to spill the beans about this student?’ ‘My memory is a bit hazy, to be honest with you.’ ‘That’s convenient. Perfect alibi. If Isobel finds out. Not that you’re exactly man of the match in her eyes.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘No offence, mate, but you’ve told me what her opinion is.’ ‘No offence, mate, but you’ve told me what her opinion is.’ ‘What is her opinion of’ – I hesitated – ‘of me?’ He pressed one final handful of crisps in his mouth and washed it down with that disgusting phosphoric acid-flavoured drink called Coca-Cola. ‘Her opinion is that you are a selfish bastard.’ ‘Why does she think that?’ ‘Maybe because you are a selfish bastard. But then, we’re all selfish bastards.’ ‘Are we?’ ‘Oh yeah. It’s our DNA. Dawkins pointed that out to us, way back. But you, man, your selfish gene is on a different level. With you, I should imagine, your selfish gene is similar to the one that smashed a rock over the head of that penultimate Neanderthal, before turning round and screwing his wife.’ He smiled and carried on watching the match. It was a long match. Elsewhere in the universe, stars formed and others ceased to be. Was this the purpose of human existence? Was the purpose somewhere inside the pleasure, or at least the casual simplicity of a football match? Eventually, the game ended. ‘That was great,’ I lied, as we walked out of the grounds. ‘Was it? We lost four nil.’ ‘Yes, but while I watched it I didn’t think once about my mortality, or the various other difficulties our mortal form will bring in later life.’ He looked bewildered again. He was going to say something but he was beaten to it by someone throwing an empty can at my head. Even though it was thrown from behind I had sensed it coming, and ducked quickly out of the way. Ari was stunned by my reflexes. As, I think, was the can-thrower. ‘Oi, wanker,’ the can-thrower said, ‘you’re that freak on the web. The naked one. Bit warm, ain’t you? With all those clothes on.’ ‘Piss off, mate,’ Ari said nervously. The man did the opposite. The can-thrower was walking over. He had red cheeks and very small eyes and greasy black hair. He was flanked by two friends. All three of them had faces ready for violence. Red Cheeks leaned in close to Ari. ‘What did you say, big man?’ ‘There might have been a “piss” in there,’ said Ari, ‘and there was definitely an “off”.’ The man grabbed Ari’s coat. ‘Think you’re smart?’ ‘Moderately.’ I held the man’s arm. ‘Get off me, you fucking perv,’ he responded. ‘I was speaking to fat bastard.’ I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt anyone – only needed to, and there was a difference. With this person, there was a definite desire to hurt him. I heard the rasp of his breath, and tightened his lungs. Within seconds he was heard the rasp of his breath, and tightened his lungs. Within seconds he was reaching for his inhaler. ‘We’ll be on our way,’ I said, releasing the pressure in his chest. ‘And you three won’t bother us again.’ Ari and I walked home, unfollowed. ‘Bloody hell,’ said Ari. ‘What was that?’ I didn’t answer. How could I? What that had been was something Ari could never understand. Clouds gathered together quickly. The sky darkened. It looked like rain. I hated rain, as I have told you. I knew Earth rain wasn’t sulphuric acid, but rain, all rain, was something I could not abide. I panicked. I started running. ‘Wait!’ said Ari, who was running behind me. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Rain!’ I said, wishing for a dome around the whole of Cambridge. ‘I can’t stand rain.’ Light-bulb ‘Have a nice time?’ Isobel asked on my return. She was standing on top of one form of primitive technology (step-ladder) changing another one (incandescent light-bulb). ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I did some good groaning. But to be honest with you, I don’t think I’ll go again.’ She dropped the new bulb. It smashed. ‘Damn. We don’t have another one.’ She looked, almost, like she might cry about this fact. She stepped down from the ladder, and I stared up at the dead light-bulb still hanging there. I concentrated hard. A moment later it was working again. ‘That was lucky. It didn’t need changing after all.’ Isobel stared at the light. The golden illumination on her skin was quite mesmerising, for some reason. The way it shifted shadow. Made her more distinctly herself. ‘How weird,’ she said. Then she looked down at the broken glass. ‘I’ll see to that,’ I said. And she smiled at me and her hand touched mine and gave it a quick pulse of gratitude. And then she did something I wasn’t expecting at all. She embraced me, gently, with broken glass still at our feet. I breathed her in. I liked the warmth of her body against mine and realised the pathos of being a human. Of being a mortal creature who was essentially alone but needed the myth of togetherness with others. Friends, children, lovers. It was an attractive myth. It was a myth you could easily inhabit. ‘Oh Andrew,’ she said. I didn’t know what she meant by this simple declaration of my name, but when she stroked my back I found myself stroking hers, and saying the words that seemed somehow the most appropriate. ‘It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay . . .’ Shopping I went to the funeral of Daniel Russell. I watched the coffin being lowered into the ground, and earth being sprinkled over the top of the wood casket. There were lots of people there, most of them wearing black. A few were crying. Afterwards, Isobel wanted to go over and talk to Tabitha. Tabitha looked different to when I had last seen her. She looked older, even though it had only been a week. She wasn’t crying, but it seemed like an effort not to. Isobel stroked her arm. ‘Listen, Tabitha, I just want you to know, we’re here. Whatever you need, we’re here.’ ‘Thank you, Isobel. That really does mean a lot. It really does.’ ‘Just basic stuff. If you don’t feel up to the supermarket. I mean, supermarkets are not the most sympathetic of places.’ ‘That’s very kind. I know you can do it online, but I’ve never got the hang of it.’ ‘Well, don’t worry. We’ll sort it out.’ And this actually happened. Isobel went to get another human’s shopping, and paid for it, and came home and told me I was looking better. ‘Am I?’ ‘Yes. You’re looking yourself again.’ The Zeta Function ‘Are you sure you’re ready?’ Isobel asked me, the next Monday morning, as I ate my first peanut butter sandwich of the day. Newton was asking it, too. Either that, or he was asking about the sandwich. I tore him off a piece. ‘Yes. It will be fine. What could go wrong?’ This was when Gulliver let out a mocking groan sound. The only sound he’d made all morning. ‘What’s up, Gulliver?’ I asked. ‘Everything,’ he said. He didn’t expand. Instead, he left his uneaten cereal and stormed upstairs. ‘Should I follow him?’ ‘No,’ Isobel said. ‘Give him time.’ I nodded. I trusted her. Time was her subject, after all. An hour later I was in Andrew’s office. It was the first time I had been there since I had deleted the email to Daniel Russell. This time, I wasn’t in a rush and could absorb a few more details. As he was a professor, there were books lining every wall, designed so that from whichever angle you looked at him you would see a book. I looked at some of the titles. Very primitive-looking in the main. A History of Binary and Other Non-decimal Numeration. Hyperbolic Geometry. The Book of Hexagonal Tessellation. Logarithmic Spirals and the Golden Mean. There was a book written by Andrew himself. One I hadn’t noticed the last time I had been here. It was a thin book called The Zeta Function. It had the words ‘Uncorrected Proof Copy’ on the cover. I made sure the door was locked and then sat down in his chair and read every word. And what a depressing read it was, I have to say. It was about the Riemann hypothesis, and what seemed like his futile quest to prove it and explain why the spaces between prime numbers increased the way they did. The tragedy was in realising how desperately he had wanted to solve it – and, of course, after he’d written the book he had solved it, though the benefits he’d imagined would never happen, because I had destroyed the proof. And I began to think of how fundamentally our equivalent mathematical breakthrough – the one which we came to know as the Second Basic Theory of Prime Numbers – had on us. How it enabled us to do all that we can do. Travel the universe. Inhabit other worlds, transform into other bodies. Live as long as we want to live. Search each other’s minds, each other’s dreams. All that. The Zeta Function did, however, list all the things humans had achieved. The main steps on the road. The developments that had advanced them towards civilisation. Fire, that was a biggie. The plough. The printing press. The steam engine. The microchip. The discovery of DNA. And humans would be the first to congratulate themselves on all this. But the trouble was, for them, they had never made the leap most other intelligent life forms in the universe had made. Oh, they had built rockets and probes and satellites. A few of them even worked. Yet, really, their mathematics had thus far let them down. They had yet to do the big stuff. The synchronisation of brains. The creation of free-thinking computers. Automation technology. Inter-galactic travel. And as I read, I realised I was stopping all these opportunities. I had killed their future. The phone rang. It was Isobel. ‘Andrew, what are you doing? Your lecture started ten minutes ago.’ She was cross, but in a concerned way. It still felt strange, and new, having someone be worried about me. I didn’t fully understand this concern, or what she gained by having it, but I must confess I quite liked being the subject of it. ‘Oh yes. Thank you for reminding me. I will go. Bye, erm, darling.’ Be careful. We are listening. The problem with equations I walked into the lecture hall. It was a large room made predominantly of dead trees. There were a lot of people staring at me. These were students. Some had pens and paper. Others had computers. All were waiting for knowledge. I scanned the room. There were 102 of them, in total. Always an unsettling number, stuck as it is between two primes. I tried to work out the students’ knowledge level. You see, I didn’t want to overshoot. I looked behind me. There was a whiteboard where words and equations were meant to be written but there was nothing on it. I hesitated. And during that hesitation someone sensed my weakness. Someone on the back row. A male of about twenty, with bushy blond hair and a T-shirt which said ‘What part of N = R x fs x fp x ne x f l x fi x fc x L don’t you understand?’ He giggled at the wit he was about to display and shouted out, ‘You look a bit overdressed today, Professor!’ He giggled some more, and it was contagious; the howling laughter spreading like fire across the whole hall. Within moments, everyone in the hall was laughing. Well, everyone except one person, a female. The non-laughing female was looking at me intently. She had red curly hair, full lips and wide eyes. She had a startling frankness about her appearance. An openness that reminded me of a death flower. She was wearing a cardigan and coiling strands of her hair around her finger. ‘Calm down,’ I said, to the rest of them. ‘That is very funny. I get it. I am wearing clothes and you are referring to an occasion in which I was not wearing clothes. Very funny. You think it is a joke, like when Georg Cantor said the scientist Francis Bacon wrote the plays of William Shakespeare, or when John Nash started seeing men in hats who weren’t really there. That was funny. The human mind is a limited, but high plateau. Spend your life at its outer limits and, oops, you might fall off. That is funny. Yes. But don’t worry, you won’t fall off. Young man, you are right there in the middle of your plateau. Though I appreciate your concern, I have to say I am feeling much better now. I am wearing underpants and socks and trousers and even a shirt.’ wearing underpants and socks and trousers and even a shirt.’ People were laughing again, but this time the laughter felt warmer. And it did something to me, inside, this warmth. So then I started laughing, too. Not at what I had just said, because I didn’t see how that was funny. No. I was laughing at myself. The impossible fact that I was there, on that most absurd planet and yet actually liking being there. And I felt an urge to tell someone how good it felt, in human form, to laugh. The release of it. And I wanted to tell someone about it and I realised that I didn’t want to tell the hosts. I wanted to tell Isobel. Anyway, I did the lecture. Apparently I had been meant to be talking about something called ‘post-Euclidean geometry’. But I didn’t want to talk about that, so I talked about the boy’s T-shirt. The formula written on it was something called Drake’s equation. It was an equation devised to calculate the likelihood of advanced civilisations in Earth’s galaxy, or what the humans called the Milky Way galaxy. (That is how humans came to terms with the vast expanse of space. By saying it looks like a splatter of spilt milk. Something dropped out of the fridge that could be wiped away in a second.) So, the equation: N = R x fp x ne x f l x f i x fc x L N was the number of advanced civilisations in the galaxy with whom communication might be possible. R was the average annual rate at which stars were formed. The f p was the fraction of those stars with planets. The ne was the average number of those planets that have the right eco-systems for life. The f 1 was the fraction of those planets where life would actually develop. The f i was the fraction of the above planets that could develop intelligence. The f c was the fraction of those where a communicative technologically advanced civilisation could develop. And L was the lifetime of the communicative phase. Various astrophysicists had looked at all the data and decided that there must, in fact, be millions of planets in the galaxy containing life, and even more in the universe at large. And some of these were bound to have advanced life with very good technology. This of course was true. But the humans didn’t just stop there. They came up with a paradox. They said, ‘Hold on, this can’t be right. If there are this many extraterrestrial civilisations with the ability to contact us then we would know about it because they would have contacted us.’ ‘Well, that’s true, isn’t it?’ said the male whose T-shirt started this detour. ‘No,’ I said. ‘No, it’s not. Because the equation should have some other fractions in there. For instance, it should have—’ I turned and wrote on the board behind me: fcgas ‘Fraction who could give a shit about visiting or communicating with Earth.’ And then: fdsbthdr ‘Fraction who did so but the humans didn’t realise.’ It was not exactly difficult to make human students of mathematics laugh. Indeed, I had never met a sub-category of life form so desperate to laugh – but still, it felt good. For a few brief moments, it even felt slightly more than good. I felt warmth and, I don’t know, a kind of forgiveness or acceptance from these students. ‘But listen,’ I said, ‘don’t worry. Those aliens up there – they don’t know what they are missing.’ Applause. (When humans really like something they clap their hands together. It makes no sense. But when they do it on behalf of you, it warms your brain.) And then, at the end of the lecture, the staring woman came up to me. The open flower. She stood close to me. Normally, when humans stand and talk to each other they try and leave some air between them, for purposes of breathing and etiquette and claustrophobia limitation. With this one, there was very little air. ‘I phoned,’ she said, with her full mouth, in a voice I had heard before, ‘to ask about you. But you weren’t there. Did you get my message?’ ‘Oh. Oh yes. Maggie. I got the message.’ ‘You seemed on top form today.’ ‘Thank you. I thought I would do something a bit different.’ She laughed. The laughter was fake, but something about its fakeness made me excited for some unfathomable reason. ‘Are we still having our first Tuesdays of the month?’ she asked me. ‘Oh yes,’ I said, utterly confused. ‘First Tuesdays of the month will be left intact.’ ‘That’s good.’ Her voice sounded warm and menacing, like the wind that speeds across the southern waste lands of home. ‘And listen, you know that heavy conversation we had, the night before you went la-la?’ ‘La-la?’ ‘You know. Before your routine at Corpus Christi.’ ‘What did I tell you? My mind’s a little hazy about that night, that’s all.’ ‘Oh, the kind of things you can’t say in lecture halls.’ ‘Mathematical things?’ ‘Actually, correct me if I’m wrong, but mathematical things are the kind of things you can say in lecture halls.’ I wondered about this woman, this girl, and more specifically I wondered what kind of relationship she’d had with Andrew Martin. ‘Yes. Oh yes. Of course.’ This Maggie knew nothing, I told myself. ‘Anyway,’ she said, ‘I’ll see you.’ ‘Yes. Yes. See you.’ She walked away, and I watched her walk away. For a moment there was no fact in the universe except the one that related to a female human called Maggie walking away from me. I didn’t like her, but I had no idea why. The violet A little while later I was in the college café, with Ari, having a grapefruit juice while he had a sugar-laden coffee and a packet of beef-flavoured crisps. ‘How’d it go, mate?’ I tried not to catch his cow-scented breath. ‘Good. Good. I educated them about alien life. Drake’s Equation.’ ‘Bit out of your territory?’ ‘Out of my territory? What do you mean?’ ‘Subject-wise.’ ‘Mathematics is every subject.’ He screwed up his face. ‘Tell ’em about Fermi’s Paradox?’ ‘They told me, actually.’ ‘All bollocks.’ ‘You think?’ ‘Well, what the fuck would an extraterrestrial life form want to come here for?’ ‘That is pretty much what I said.’ ‘I mean, personally, I think physics tells us there is an exo-planet out there with life on it. But I don’t think we understand what we’re looking for or what form it will take. Though I think this will be the century we find it. Course, most people don’t want to find it. Even the ones who pretend they do. They don’t want to really.’ ‘Don’t they? Why not?’ He held up his hand. A signal for me to have patience while he completed the important task of chewing and then swallowing the crisps that were in his mouth. ‘’Cause it troubles people. They turn it into a joke. You’ve got the brightest physicists in the world these days, saying over and over and over, as plainly as physicists can manage, that there has to be other life out there. And other people too – and I mean thick people, mainly – you know, star sign people, the kind of people whose ancestors used to find omens in ox shit. But not just them, other people too, people who should know a lot better – you’ve got those people saying aliens are obviously made up because War of the Worlds was made up and Close Encounters of The Third Kind was made up and though they liked those things they kind of formed a prejudice in their head that aliens can only be enjoyed as fiction. Because if you believe in them as fact you are saying the thing that every unpopular scientific breakthrough in history has said.’ ‘Which is what? ‘That humans are not at the centre of things. You know, the planet is in orbit around the sun. That was a fucking hilarious joke in the 1500s, but Copernicus wasn’t a comedian. He was, apparently, the least funny man of the whole Renaissance. He made Raphael look like Richard Pryor. But he was telling the fucking truth. The planet is in orbit around the sun. But that was out there, I’m telling you. Course, he made sure he was dead by the time it was published. Let Galileo take the heat.’ ‘Right,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ As I listened, I noticed a pain begin behind my eyes, getting sharper. On the fringes of my vision there was a blur of violet. ‘Oh, and animals have nervous systems,’ Ari went on, between swigs of coffee. ‘And could feel pain. That annoyed a few people at the time, too. And some people still don’t want to believe the world is as old as it is because that would mean having to accept the truth that humans, in the day that has been the Earth, have been here for less than a minute. We’re a late-night piss in the toilet, that’s all we are.’ ‘Right,’ I said, massaging my eyelids. ‘Recorded history is just the length it takes to the flush. And now we know we don’t have free will, people are getting pissed off about that, too. So, if and when they discover aliens they’d be really pretty unsettled because then we’d have to know, once and for all, that there is nothing really unique or special about us at all.’ He sighed, and gazed intently at the interior of his empty packet of crisps. ‘So I can see why it’s easy to dismiss alien life as a joke, one for teenage boys with overactive wrists and imaginations.’ ‘What would happen,’ I asked him, ‘if an actual alien were found on Earth?’ ‘What do you think would happen?’ ‘I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking you.’ ‘Well, I think if they had the brains to get here they’d have the brains to not reveal they were alien. They could have been here. They could have arrived in things that weren’t anything like sci-fi ‘ships’. They might not have UFOs. There might be no flying involved, and no object to fail to identify. Who the fuck knows? Maybe they were just you.’ I sat upright in my chair. Alert. ‘What?’ I sat upright in my chair. Alert. ‘What?’ ‘U. As in: no FO. Unidentified. Unidentified.’ ‘Okay. But what if, somehow, they were identified. They were “I”. What if humans knew an alien was living among them?’ After asking this, all around the café appeared little wisps of violet in the air, which no one seemed to notice. Ari downed the last of his coffee, and then considered for a moment. Scratched his face with his meaty fingers. ‘Well, put it this way, I wouldn’t want to be that poor bastard.’ ‘Ari,’ I said. ‘Ari, I am that—’ Poor bastard, was what I was going to say. But I didn’t because right then, at that precise moment, there was a noise inside my head. It was a sound of the highest possible frequency and it was extremely loud. Accompanying it, and matching it for intensity, was the pain behind my eyes, which became infinitely worse. It was the most excruciating pain I’d ever experienced, and it was a pain I had no control over. Wishing it not to be there wasn’t the same thing as it not being there, and that confused me. Or it would have done, if I’d had the capacity to think beyond the pain. And I kept thinking about the pain, and the sound, and the violet. But this sharp, throbbing heat pressing behind my eyes was too much. ‘Mate, what’s up?’ I was holding my head by this point, trying to close my eyes, but they wouldn’t close. I looked at Ari’s unshaven face, then at the few other people in the café, and the girl with glasses who was standing behind the counter. Something was happening to them, and to the whole place. Everything was dissolving into a rich, varied violet, a colour more familiar to me than any other. ‘The hosts,’ I said, aloud and almost simultaneously the pain increased further. ‘Stop, oh stop, oh stop.’ ‘Man, I’m calling an ambulance,’ he said, because I was on the floor now. A swirling violet sea. ‘No.’ I fought against it. I got to my feet. The pain lessened. The ringing became a low hum. The violet faded. ‘It was nothing,’ I said. Ari laughed, nervous. ‘I’m no expert but that honestly looked like something.’ ‘It was just a headache. A flash of pain. I’ll go to the doctor and check it out.’ ‘You should. You really should.’ ‘Yes. I will.’ ‘Yes. I will.’ I sat down. An ache remained, as a reminder, for a while, along with a few ethereal wisps in the air only I could see. ‘You were going to say something. About other life.’ ‘No,’ I said quietly. ‘Pretty sure you were, man.’ ‘Yeah, well. I think I’ve forgotten.’ And after that the pain disappeared altogether, and the air lost its final trace of violet. The possibility of pain I didn’t mention anything to Isobel or Gulliver. I knew it was unwise, because I knew the pain had been a warning. And besides, even if I wanted to tell her I wouldn’t have, because Gulliver had arrived home with a bruised eye. When human skin bruises, the skin takes various shades. Greys, browns, blues, greens. Among them, a dull violet. Beautiful, petrifying violet. ‘Gulliver, what happened?’ His mother asked the question quite a few times that evening but never got a satisfactory reply. He went into the small utility room behind the kitchen and closed the door. ‘Please, Gull, come out of there,’ said his mother. ‘We need to talk about this.’ ‘Gulliver, come out of there,’ I added. Eventually he opened the door. ‘Just leave me alone.’ That ‘alone’ was said with such a hard, cold force Isobel decided it was best to grant him that wish so we stayed downstairs while he trudged up to his room. ‘I’m going to have to phone the school about this tomorrow.’ I said nothing. Of course, I would later realise this was a mistake. I should have broken my promise to Gulliver and told her that he hadn’t been going to school. But I didn’t, because it wasn’t my duty. I did have a duty, but it wasn’t to humans. Even these ones. Especially these ones. And it was a duty I was already failing to follow, as that afternoon’s warning in the café had told me. Newton, though, had a different sense of duty and he headed up three flights of stairs to be with Gulliver. Isobel didn’t know what to do, so she opened a few cupboard doors, stared into the cupboards, sighed, then closed them again. ‘Listen,’ I found myself saying, ‘he is going to have to find his own way, and make his own mistakes.’ ‘We need to find out who did that to him, Andrew. That’s what we need to do. People can’t just go around inflicting violence on human beings like that. They just can’t do that. What ethical code do you live by where you can sound so indifferent about it?’ What could I say? ‘I’m sorry. I’m not indifferent. I care for him, of course I What could I say? ‘I’m sorry. I’m not indifferent. I care for him, of course I do.’ And the terrifying thing, the absolutely awful fact I had to face, was that I was right. I did care. The warning had failed, you see. Indeed, it had had the opposite effect. That’s what starts to happen, when you know it is possible for you to feel pain you have no control over. You become vulnerable. Because the possibility of pain is where love stems from. And that, for me, was very bad news indeed. Sloping roofs (and other ways to deal with the rain) and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, – William Shakespeare, Hamlet I couldn’t sleep. Of course I couldn’t. I had a whole universe to worry about. And I kept thinking about the pain, and the sound, and the violet. On top of that, it was raining. I decided to leave Isobel in bed and go and talk with Newton. I headed slowly downstairs, with my hands over my ears, trying to cancel out the sound of falling cloud water drumming against the windows. To my disappointment Newton was sleeping soundly in his basket. On my return upstairs I noticed something else. The air was cooler than it should have been, and the coolness was coming from above rather than below. This went against the order of things. I thought of his bruised eye, and I thought further back. I headed up towards the attic and noticed that everything there was exactly as it should be. The computer, the Dark Matter posters, the random array of socks – everything, that was, except Gulliver himself. A piece of paper floated towards me, carried on the breeze from the open window. On it were two words. I’m sorry. I looked at the window. Outside was the night and the shivering stars of this most alien, yet most familiar galaxy. Somewhere beyond this sky was home. I realised I could now get back there if I wanted. I could just finish my task and be back in my painless world. The window sloped in line with the roof, which like so many roofs here was designed to usher away the rain. It was easy enough for me to climb out of but for to usher away the rain. It was easy enough for me to climb out of but for Gulliver it must have been quite an exertion. The difficult thing for me was the rain itself. It was relentless. Skin-soaking. I saw him sitting on the edge, next to the gutter rail, with his knees pulled into his chest. He looked cold and bedraggled. And seeing him there I saw him not as a special entity, an exotic collection of protons, electrons and neutrons, but as a – using the human term – as a person. And I felt, I don’t know, connected with him. Not in the quantum sense in which everything was connected to everything else, and in which every atom spoke to and negotiated with every other atom. No. This was on another level. A level far, far harder to understand. Can I end his life? I started walking towards him. Not easy, given the human feet and 45-degree angle and the wet slate – sleek quartz and muscovite – on which I was relying. When I was getting close he turned around and saw me. ‘What are you doing?’ he asked. He was frightened. That was the main thing I noticed. ‘I was about to ask you the same thing.’ ‘Dad, just go away.’ What he was saying made sense. I mean, I could have just left him there. I could have escaped the rain, the terrible sensation of that falling water on my thin non-vascular skin, and gone inside. It was then I had to face why I was really out there. ‘No,’ I said, to my own confusion. ‘I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to go away.’ I slipped a little. A tile came unstuck, slid, fell and smashed to the ground. The smash woke Newton, who started barking. Gulliver’s eyes widened, then his head jerked away. His whole body seemed full of nervous intention. ‘Don’t do it,’ I said. He let go of something. It landed in the gutter. The small plastic cylinder that had contained the twenty-eight diazepam tablets. Now empty. I stepped closer. I had read enough human literature to realise that suicide was a real option, here, on Earth. Yet again I wondered why this should have bothered me. I was becoming mad. Losing my rationality. If Gulliver wanted to kill himself then, logically, that solved a major problem. And I should just stand back and let it happen. And I should just stand back and let it happen. ‘Gulliver, listen to me. Don’t jump. Trust me, you’re nowhere near high enough to guarantee that you’ll kill yourself.’ This was true, but as far as I could calculate there was still a very good chance of him falling and dying on impact. In which instance, there would be nothing I could do to help him. Injuries could always be healed. Death meant death. A zero squared was still a zero. ‘I remember swimming with you,’ he said, ‘when I was eight. When we were in France. Can you remember, that night you taught me how to play dominoes?’ He looked back at me, wanting to see a recognition I couldn’t give him. It was hard to see his bruised eye in this light; there was so much darkness across his face he might as well have been all bruise. ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Of course I remember that.’ ‘Liar! You don’t remember.’ ‘Listen, Gulliver, let’s go inside. Let’s talk about this indoors. If you still want to kill yourself I’ll take you to a higher building.’ Gulliver didn’t seem to be listening, as I kept stepping on the slippery slate towards him. ‘That’s the last good memory I have,’ he said. It sounded sincere. ‘Come on, that can’t be true.’ ‘Do you have any idea what it’s like? To be your son?’ ‘No. I don’t.’ He pointed to his eye. ‘This. This is what it’s like.’ ‘Gulliver, I’m sorry.’ ‘Do you know what it’s like to feel stupid all the time?’ ‘You’re not stupid.’ I was still standing. The human way would have been to shuffle down on my backside, but that would have taken too much time. So I kept taking tentative steps on the slate, leaning back just enough, in continuous negotiation with gravity. ‘I’m stupid. I’m nothing.’ ‘No, Gulliver, you’re not. You’re something. You’re—’ He wasn’t listening. The diazepam was taking hold of him. ‘How many tablets did you take?’ I asked. ‘All of them?’ I was nearly at him, my hand was almost within grasping distance of his shoulder as his eyes closed and he disappeared into sleep, or prayer. Another tile came loose. I slipped on to my side, losing my footing on the rain-greased tiles until I was left hanging on to the gutter rail. I could have easily climbed back up. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was that Gulliver was now tilting forward. ‘Gulliver, wait! Wake up! Wake up, Gulliver!’ ‘Gulliver, wait! Wake up! Wake up, Gulliver!’ The tilt gained momentum. ‘No!’ He fell, and I fell with him. First internally, a kind of emotional falling, a silent howl into an abyss, and then physically. I sped through the air with a dreadful velocity. I broke my legs. So that was my intention. Let the legs take the pain, and not the head, because I would need my head. But the pain was immense. For a moment I worried they wouldn’t reheal. It was only the sight of Gulliver lying totally unconscious on the ground a few metres away that gave me focus. Blood leaked from his ear. To heal him I knew I would first of all need to heal myself. And it happened. Simply wishing was enough, if you wished hard enough, with the right kind of intelligence. That said, cell regeneration and bone reconstruction still took a lot of energy, especially as I was losing a lot of blood and had multiple fractures. But the pain diminished as a strange, intense fatigue took over me and gravity tried to grip me to the ground. My head hurt, but not as a result of the fall; from the exertion involved in my physical restoration. I stood up dizzily. I managed to move towards where Gulliver lay, the horizontal ground now sloping more than the roof. ‘Gulliver. Come on. Can you hear me? Gulliver?’ I could have called for help, I knew that. But help meant an ambulance and a hospital. Help meant humans grasping around in the dark of their own medical ignorance. Help meant delay and a death I was meant to approve of, but couldn’t. ‘Gulliver?’ There was no pulse. He was dead. I must have been seconds too late. I could already detect the first tiny descent in his body temperature. Rationally, I should have resigned myself to this fact. And yet. I had read a lot of Isobel’s work and so I knew that the whole of human history was full of people who tried against the odds. Some succeeded, most failed, but that hadn’t stopped them. Whatever else you could say about these particular primates, they could be determined. And they could hope. Oh yes, they could hope. And hope was often irrational. It made no sense. If it had made sense it would have been called, well, sense. The other thing about hope was that it took effort, and I had never been used to effort. At home, nothing had been an effort. That was the whole point of home, the comfort of a perfectly effortless existence. Yet there I was. Hoping. Not that I was standing there, passively, just wishing him better from a distance. Of course not. I placed my left hand – my gift hand – to his heart, and I began to work. The thing with feathers It was exhausting. I thought of binary stars. A red giant and a white dwarf, side by side, the life force of one being sucked into that of the other. His death was a fact I was convinced I could disprove, or dissuade. But death wasn’t a white dwarf. It was a good bit beyond that. It was a black hole. And once you stepped past that event horizon, you were in very difficult territory. You are not dead. Gulliver, you are not dead. I kept at it, because I knew what life was, I understood its nature, its character, its stubborn insistence. Life, especially human life, was an act of defiance. It was never meant to be, and yet it existed in an incredible number of places across a near-infinite amount of solar systems. There was no such thing as impossible. I knew that, because I also knew that everything was impossible, and so the only possibilities in life were impossibilities. A chair could stop being a chair at any moment. That was quantum physics. And you could manipulate atoms if you knew how to talk to them. You are not dead, you are not dead. I felt terrible. Waves of deep-level pained, bone-scorching effort tore through me like solar flares. And yet he still lay there. His face, I noticed for the first time, looking like his mother. Serene, egg-fragile, precious. A light came on inside the house. Isobel must have woken, from the sound of Newton’s barking if nothing else, but I wasn’t conscious of that. I was just aware that Gulliver was suddenly illuminated and, shortly after, there was the faintest flicker of a pulse beneath my hand. Hope. ‘Gulliver, Gulliver, Gulliver—’ Another pulse. Stronger. A defiant drumbeat of life. A back-beat, waiting for melody. Duh-dum. And again, and again, and again. He was alive. His lips twitched, his bruised eyes moved like an egg about to hatch. One opened. So did the other. It was the eyes, on Earth, that mattered. You saw the person, and the life inside them, if you saw the eyes. And I saw him, this messed-up, sensitive boy and felt, for a moment, the exhausted wonder of a father. It should have been a moment to savour, but it wasn’t. I was being flooded with pain, and violet. I could feel myself about to collapse on to the glossy wet ground. Footsteps behind me. And that was the last thing I heard before the darkness arrived to make its claim, along with remembered poetry, as Emily Dickinson shyly came towards me through the violet and whispered in my ear. Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all. Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens I was back at home, on Vonnadoria, and it was exactly how it had always been. And I was exactly how I had always been, among them, the hosts, feeling no pain and no fear. Our beautiful, warless world, where I could be entranced by the purest mathematics for all eternity. .Any human who arrived here, gazing at our violet landscapes, might well have believed they had entered Heaven But what happened in Heaven? What did you do there? After a while, didn’t you crave flaws? Love and lust and misunderstandings, and maybe even a little violence to liven things up? Didn’t light need shade? Didn’t it? Maybe it didn’t. Maybe I was missing the point. Maybe the point was to exist with an absence of pain. Yes, to exist with an absence of pain. Yes, maybe that was the only aim you needed in life. It certainly had been, but what happened if you’d never required that aim because you were born after that goal had been met? I was younger than the hosts. I did not share their appreciation of just how lucky I was. Not any more. Not even in a dream. In-between I woke up. On Earth. But I was so weak I was returning to my original state. I had heard about this. Indeed, I had swallowed a word capsule about it. Rather than allow you to die your body would return to its original state, because the amount of extra energy deployed to be someone else would more usefully serve to preserve your life. And that was all the gifts were there for, really. Self-preservation. The protection of eternity. Which was fine, in theory. In theory, it was a great idea. But the only problem was that this was Earth. And my original state wasn’t equipped for the air here, or the gravity, or the face-to-face contact. I didn’t want Isobel to see me. It just could not happen. And so, as soon as I felt my atoms itch and tingle, warm and shift, I told Isobel to do what she was already doing: looking after Gulliver. And as she crouched down, with her back to me, I got to my feet, which at this point were recognisably human-shaped. Then I shifted myself – midway between two contrasting forms – across the back garden. Luckily the garden was large and dark, with lots of flowers and shrubs and trees to hide behind. So I did. I hid among the beautiful flowers. And I saw Isobel looking around, even as she was calling for an ambulance for Gulliver. ‘Andrew!’ she said at one point, as Gulliver got to his feet. She even ran into the garden to have a look. But I stayed still. ‘Where have you disappeared to?’ My lungs began to burn. I needed more nitrogen. It would have taken only one word in my native tongue. Home. The one the hosts were primed to hear, and I would be back there. So why didn’t I say it? Because I hadn’t finished my task? No. It wasn’t that. I was never going to finish my task. That was the education this night had brought me. So why? Why was I choosing risk and pain over their opposites? What had happened to me? What was wrong? Newton, now, came out into the garden. He trotted along, sniffing the plants and flowers until he sensed me standing there. I expected him to bark and draw attention, but he didn’t. He just stared at me, his eyes shining blank circles, and seemed to know exactly who it was, standing behind the juniper bushes. But he stayed quiet. He was a good dog. And I loved him. I can’t do it. We know. There is no point in doing it anyway. There is every point. I don’t believe Isobel and Gulliver should be harmed. We believe you have been corrupted. I haven’t. I have gained more knowledge. That is all that has happened. No. You have been infected by them. Infected? Infected? With what? With emotion. No. I haven’t. That is not true. It is true. Listen, emotions have a logic. Without emotions humans wouldn’t care for each other, and if they didn’t care for each other the species would have died out. To care for others is self-preservation. You care for someone and they care for you. You are speaking like one of them. You are not a human. You are one of us. We are one. I know I am not a human. We think you need to come home. No. You must come home. I never had a family. We are your family. No. It isn’t the same. We want you home. I have to ask to come home and I am not going to. You can interfere with my mind but you can’t control it. We will see. Two weeks in the Dordogne and a box of dominoes The next day we were in the living room. Me and Isobel. Newton was upstairs with Gulliver, who was now asleep. We had checked on him but Newton was staying there, on guard. ‘How are you?’ asked Isobel. ‘It was not death,’ I said. ‘For I stood up.’ ‘You saved his life,’ said Isobel. ‘I don’t think so. I didn’t even have to do CPR. The doctor said he had very minor injuries.’ ‘I don’t care what the doctor says. He jumped from the roof. That could have killed him. Why didn’t you shout for me?’ ‘I did.’ It was a lie, obviously, but the whole framework was a lie. The belief that I was her husband. It was all fiction. ‘I did shout for you.’ ‘You could have killed yourself.’ (I have to admit that humans waste a lot of their time – almost all of it – with hypothetical stuff. I could be rich. I could be famous. I could have been hit by that bus. I could have been born with fewer moles and bigger breasts. I could have spent more of my youth learning foreign languages. They must exercise the conditional tense more than any other known life form.) ‘But I didn’t kill myself. I am alive. Let’s concentrate on that.’ ‘What happened to your tablets? They were in the cupboard.’ ‘I threw them away.’ This was a lie, obviously. The unclear thing was who I was protecting? Isobel? Gulliver? Myself? ‘Why? Why would you throw them away?’ ‘I didn’t think it was a good idea, to have them lying around. You know, given his condition.’ ‘But they’re diazepam. That’s valium. You can’t overdose on valium, you’d need a thousand.’ ‘No. I know that.’ I was drinking a cup of tea. I actually enjoyed tea. It was so much better than coffee. It tasted like comfort. Isobel nodded. She too was drinking tea. The tea seemed to be making things Isobel nodded. She too was drinking tea. The tea seemed to be making things better. It was a hot drink made of leaves, used in times of crisis as a means of restoring normality. ‘Do you know what they told me?’ she said. ‘No. What? What did they tell you?’ ‘They told me he could stay in.’ ‘Right.’ ‘It was up to me. I had to say if I thought he was a suicide risk or not. And I said I thought he would be more of a risk in there than out here. They said if he tried anything like this again then there’d be no choice about it. He’d be admitted, and they’d watch him.’ ‘Oh. Well, we’ll watch him. That’s what I say. That hospital is full of mad people. People who think they’re from other planets. Stuff like that.’ She smiled a sad smile, and blew a brown tide of ripples across the surface of her drink. ‘Yes. Yes. We’ll have to.’ I tried to understand something. ‘It’s me, isn’t it? It was my fault, for that day I didn’t wear clothes.’ Something about this question switched the mood. Isobel’s face hardened. ‘Andrew, do you really think this was about one day? About your breakdown?’ ‘Oh,’ I said, which I knew wasn’t in context. But I had nothing else to say. ‘Oh’ was always the word I resorted to, the one that filled empty spaces. It was verbal tea. The ‘oh’ should have really been a ‘no’, because I didn’t think this was about one day. I thought it was about thousands of days, most of which I hadn’t been there to observe. And so an ‘oh’ was more appropriate. ‘This wasn’t about one event. This was about everything. It’s not obviously solely your fault but you haven’t really been there, have you, Andrew? For all his life, or at least since we moved back to Cambridge, you’ve just not been there.’ I remembered something he’d told me on the roof. ‘What about France?’ ‘What?’ ‘I taught him dominoes. I swam with him in a swimming pool. In France. The country. France.’ She frowned, confused. ‘France? What? The Dordogne? Two weeks in the Dordogne and a box of bloody dominoes. Is that your “Get Out of Jail Free” card? Is that fatherhood?’ ‘No. I don’t know. I was just giving a . . . a solid example of what he was like.’ ‘He?’ ‘I mean I. What I was like.’ ‘You’ve been there on holiday. Yes. Yes you have. Unless they were working holidays. Come on, you remember Sydney! And Boston! And Seoul! And Turin! And, and, Düsseldorf!’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said, staring at the unread books on the shelves like unlived memories. ‘I remember them vividly. Of course.’ ‘We hardly saw you. And when we did see you, you were always so stressed about the lecture you were going to give or the people you were going to meet. And all those rows we had. We have. Until, you know, you got ill. And got better. Come on, Andrew, you know what I’m saying. This isn’t breaking news, is it?’ ‘No. Not at all. So, where else have I failed?’ ‘You haven’t failed. It’s not an academic paper to be assessed by your peers. It’s not success or failure. It’s our life. I’m not wrapping it in judgemental language. I’m just trying to tell you the objective truth.’ ‘I just want to know. Tell me. Tell me things I’ve done. Or haven’t done.’ She toyed with her silver necklace. ‘Well, come on. It’s always been the same. Between the ages of two and four you weren’t back home in time for a single bath or bedtime story. You’d fly off the handle about anything that got in the way of you and your work. Or if I ever came close to mentioning that I had sacrificed my career for this family – at that time when I had been making real sacrifices – you wouldn’t even so much as postpone a book deadline. I’d be shot down in flames.’ ‘I know. I’m sorry,’ I said, thinking of her novel, Wider Than the Sky. ‘I’ve been terrible. I have. I think you would be better off without me. I think, sometimes, that I should leave and never come back.’ ‘Don’t be childish. You sound younger than Gulliver.’ ‘I’m being serious. I have behaved badly. I sometimes think it would be better if I went and never returned. Ever.’ This threw her. She had her hands on her hips but her glare softened. She took a big breath. ‘I need you here. You know I need you.’ ‘Why? What do I give to this relationship? I don’t understand.’ She clenched her eyes shut. Whispered, ‘That was amazing.’ ‘What?’ ‘What you did there. Out on the roof. It was amazing.’ She then made the most complex facial expression I have ever seen on a human. A kind of frustrated scorn, tinged with sympathy, which slowly softened into a deep, wide humour, culminating in forgiveness and something I couldn’t quite recognise, but which I thought might have been love. ‘What’s happened to you?’ She said it as a whisper, nothing more than a ‘What’s happened to you?’ She said it as a whisper, nothing more than a structured piece of breath. ‘What? Nothing. Nothing has happened to me. Well, a mental breakdown. But I’m over that. Other than that – nothing.’ I said this flippantly, trying to make her smile. She smiled, but sadness quickly claimed her. She looked up to the ceiling. I was beginning to understand these wordless forms of communication. ‘I’ll talk to him,’ I said, feeling kind of solid and authoritative. Kind of real. Kind of human. ‘I’ll talk to him.’ ‘You don’t have to.’ ‘I know,’ I said. And I stood up, again to help when I was supposed to hurt. Social networking Essentially, social networking on Earth was quite limited. Unlike on Vonnadoria, the brain synchronisation technology wasn’t there, so subscribers couldn’t communicate telepathically with each other as part of a true hive mind. Nor could they step into each other’s dreams and have a walk around, tasting imagined delicacies in exotic moonscapes. On Earth, social networking generally involved sitting down at a non-sentient computer and typing words about needing a coffee and reading about other people needing a coffee, while forgetting to actually make a coffee. It was the news show they had been waiting for. It was the show where the news could be all about them. But on the plus side, human computer networks, I discovered, were preposterously easy to hack into as all their security systems were based on prime numbers. And so I hacked into Gulliver’s computer and changed the name of every single person on Facebook who had bullied Gulliver to ‘I Am the Cause of Shame’, and blocked them from posting anything with the word ‘Gulliver’ in it, and gave each of them a computer virus which I dubbed ‘The Flea’ after a lovely poem. This virus ensured the only messages they would ever be able to send were ones that contained the words ‘I am hurt and so I hurt’. On Vonnadoria I had never done anything so vindictive. Nor had I ever felt quite so satisfied. Forever is composed of nows We went to the park to walk Newton. Parks were the most common destination on dog walks. A piece of nature – grass, flowers, trees – that was not quite allowed to be truly natural. Just as dogs were thwarted wolves, parks were thwarted forests. Humans loved both, possibly because humans were, well, thwarted. The flowers were beautiful. Flowers, after love, must have been the best advert planet Earth had going for it. ‘It doesn’t make sense,’ said Gulliver, as we sat down on the bench. ‘What doesn’t?’ We watched Newton sniffing the flowers, livelier than ever. ‘I was fine. No damage. Even my eye’s better.’ ‘You were lucky.’ ‘Dad, before I went out on the roof, I’d had twenty-eight diazepam.’ ‘You’d need more.’ He looked at me, angry for saying this, as if I was humiliating him. Using knowledge against him. ‘Your mum told me that,’ I added. ‘I didn’t know that.’ ‘I didn’t want you to save me.’ ‘I didn’t save you. You were just lucky. But I really think you should ignore feelings like that. That was a moment in your life. You have a lot more days to live. About twenty-four thousand more days to live, probably. That’s a lot of moments. You could do many great things in that time. You could read a lot of poetry.’ ‘You don’t like poetry. That’s one of the few facts I know about you.’ ‘It’s growing on me . . . Listen,’ I said, ‘don’t kill yourself. Don’t ever kill yourself. Just, that’s my advice, don’t kill yourself.’ Gulliver took something out of his pocket and put it in his mouth. It was a cigarette. He lit it. I asked if I could try it. Gulliver seemed troubled by this but handed it over. I sucked on the filter and brought the smoke into my lungs. And then I coughed. ‘What’s the point of this?’ I asked Gulliver. ‘What’s the point of this?’ I asked Gulliver. He shrugged. ‘It’s an addictive substance with a high fatality rate. I thought there would be a point.’ I handed the cigarette back to Gulliver. ‘Thanks,’ he mumbled, still confused. ‘Don’t worry about it,’ I said. ‘It’s fine.’ He took another drag, and suddenly realised it wasn’t doing anything for him either. He flicked the cigarette in a steep arc towards the grass. ‘If you want,’ I said, ‘we could play dominoes when we get home. I bought a box this morning.’ ‘No thanks.’ ‘Or we could go to the Dordogne.’ ‘What?’ ‘Go swimming.’ He shook his head. ‘You need some more tablets.’ ‘Yes. Maybe. You ate all mine.’ I tried to smile, playfully, and try some more Earth humour. ‘You fucker!’ There was a long silence. We watched Newton sniffing around the circumference of a tree. Twice. A million suns imploded. And then Gulliver came out with it. ‘You don’t know what it’s been like,’ he said. ‘I’ve got all this expectation on me because I’m your son. My teachers read your books. And they look at me like some bruised apple that’s fallen off the great Andrew Martin tree. You know, the posh boy who got expelled from his boarding school. The one who set stuff on fire. Whose parents gave up on him. Not that I’m bothered about that now. But even in the holidays you were never around. You were always somewhere else. Or just making everything tense and horrible with Mum. It’s just shit. You should have just done the right thing and got divorced years ago. You’ve not got anything in common.’ I thought about all this. And didn’t know what to say. Cars passed by on the road behind us. The sound was very melancholy somehow, like the bass rumble of a sleeping Bazadean. ‘What was your band called?’ ‘The Lost,’ he said. A leaf fell and landed on my lap. It was dead and brown. I held it and, quite out of character, felt a strange empathy. Maybe it was because now I was empathising with humans I could empathise with pretty much anything. Too much Emily Dickinson, that was the problem. Emily Dickinson was making me human. But not that human. There was a dull ache in my head and a small weight of tiredness in my eyes as the leaf became green. I brushed it away quickly, but it was too late. ‘What just happened?’ Gulliver asked, staring at the leaf as it floated away on the breeze. I tried to ignore him. He asked again. ‘Nothing happened to the leaf,’ I said. He forgot about the leaf he might have seen the moment he saw two teenage girls and a boy his own age walking on the road that ran behind the park. The girls were laughing into their hands at the sight of us. I have realised that, essentially, there are two broad categories of human laughter, and this was not the good kind. The boy was the boy I had seen on Gulliver’s Facebook page. Theo “The Fucking Business” Clarke. Gulliver shrank. ‘It’s the Martin Martians! Freaks!’ Gulliver cowered lower on the bench, crippled with shame. I turned around, assessed Theo’s physical structure and dynamic potential. ‘My son could beat you into the ground,’ I shouted. ‘He could flatten your face into a more attractive geometric form.’ ‘Fuck, Dad,’ said Gulliver, ‘what are you doing? He’s the one who fucked up my face.’ I looked at him. He was a black hole. The violence was all inward. It was time for him to push some the other way. ‘Come on,’ I said, ‘you’re a human. It’s time to act like one.’ Violence ‘No,’ said Gulliver. But it was too late. Theo was crossing the road. ‘Yeah, you’re a comedian now, are you?’ he said as he swaggered towards us. ‘It would be fucking amusing to see you lose to my fucking son, if that’s what you fucking mean,’ I said. ‘Yeah, well, my dad’s a Taekwondo teacher. He taught me how to fight.’ ‘Well, Gulliver’s father is a mathematician. So he wins.’ ‘Yeah right.’ ‘You will lose,’ I told the boy, and I made sure the words went all the way down and stayed there, like rocks in a shallow pond. Theo laughed, and jumped with troubling ease over the low stone wall that bordered the park, with the girls following. This boy, Theo, was not as tall as Gulliver but more strongly built. He was almost devoid of neck and his eyes were so close together he was borderline cyclopic. He was walking backwards and forwards on the grass in front of us, warming up by punching and kicking the air. Gulliver was as pale as milk. ‘Gulliver,’ I told him, ‘you fell off a roof yesterday. That boy is not a forty-foot drop. There is nothing to him. No depth. You know how he is going to fight.’ ‘Yes,’ said Gulliver. ‘He’s going to fight well.’ ‘But you, you’ve got surprise on your side. You aren’t scared of anything. All you’ve got to do is realise that this Theo symbolises everything you’ve ever hated. He is me. He is bad weather. He is the primitive soul of the Internet. He is the injustice of fate. I am asking, in other words, for you to fight him like you fight in your sleep. Lose everything. Lose all shame and consciousness and beat him. Because you can.’ ‘No,’ said Gulliver, ‘I can’t.’ I lowered my voice, conjured the gifts. ‘You can. He has the same bio- chemical ingredients inside him as you do, but with less impressive neural activity.’ I saw that Gulliver looked confused, so I tapped the side of my head activity.’ I saw that Gulliver looked confused, so I tapped the side of my head and explained. ‘It’s all about the oscillations.’ Gulliver stood up. I clipped the lead to Newton’s collar. He whined, sensing the atmosphere. I watched Gulliver walk over the grass. Nervous, tight-bodied, as if being dragged by an invisible chord. The two girls were chewing something they didn’t plan to swallow, and were giggling excitedly. Theo too was looking thrilled. Some humans not only liked violence, but craved it, I realised. Not because they wanted pain, but because they already had pain and wanted to be distracted away from that kind of pain with a lesser kind. And then Theo hit Gulliver. And he hit him again. Both times in the face, sending Gulliver staggering backwards. Newton growled, seeking involvement, but I kept him where he was. ‘You are fucking nothing,’ said Theo, raising his foot fast through the air to Gulliver’s chest. Gulliver grabbed the leg, and Theo hopped for a while, or at least long enough to look ridiculous. Gulliver looked at me through the still air in silence. Then Theo was on the ground and Gulliver let him stand up before the switch flicked and he went wild, punching away as if trying to rid himself of his own body, as if it were something that could be shaken away. And pretty soon the other boy was bleeding and he fell back on the grass, his head momentarily tilting back and touching down on a rose bush. He sat up and dabbed his face with his fingers and saw the blood and looked at it as if it were a message he’d never expected to receive. ‘All right, Gulliver,’ I said, ‘It’s time to go home.’ I went over to Theo. I crouched down. ‘You are done now, do you understand?’ Theo understood. The girls were silent but still chewed, if only at half-speed. Cow-speed. We walked out of the park. Gulliver hardly had a scratch. ‘How are you feeling?’ ‘I hurt him.’ ‘Yes. How does that make you feel? Was it cathartic?’ He shrugged. The trace of a smile hid somewhere inside his lips. It frightened me, how close violence is to the civilised surface of a human being. It wasn’t the violence itself that was the worry, it was the amount of effort they’d gone to to conceal it. A homo sapiens was a primitive hunter who had woken each day with the knowledge he could kill. And now, the equivalent knowledge was only that he would wake up each day and buy something. So it was important, for Gulliver, to release what he only released in sleep out into the waking world. Gulliver, to release what he only released in sleep out into the waking world. ‘Dad, you’re not yourself, are you?’ he said, before we got back. ‘No,’ I said. ‘Not really.’ I expected another question but none came. The taste of her skin I was not Andrew. I was them. And we woke, and the still light bedroom was clotted with violet, and though my head didn’t hurt exactly, it felt extremely tight, as though my skull was a fist and my brain was the bar of soap it contained. I tried switching off the light, but the dark didn’t work. The violet stayed, expanding and leaking across reality like spilt ink. ‘Get away,’ I urged the hosts. ‘Get away.’ But they had a hold on me. You. If you are reading this. You had a terrible hold. And I was losing myself, and I knew this because I turned over in bed and I could see Isobel in the dark, facing away from me. I could see the shape of her, half under the duvet. My hand touched the back of her neck. I felt nothing towards her. We felt nothing towards her. We didn’t even see her as Isobel. She was simply a human. The way, to a human, a cow or a chicken or a microbe is simply a cow or a chicken or a microbe. As we touched her bare neck, we gained the reading. It was all we needed. She was asleep, and all we had to do was stop her heart from beating. It was really very easy. We moved our hand slightly lower, felt the heart beating through her ribs. The movement of our hand woke her slightly, and she turned, sleepily, and said with her eyes still closed, ‘I love you.’ The ‘you’ was a singular one, and it was a call to me or the me-Andrew she thought I was, and it was then that I managed to defeat them, become a me and not a we, and the thought that she had just escaped death by such a narrow margin made me realise the intensity of my feelings towards her. ‘What’s the matter?’ I couldn’t tell her, so I kissed her instead. Kissing is what humans do when words have reached a place they can’t escape from. It is a switch to another language. The kiss was an act of defiance, maybe of war. You can’t touch us, is what the kiss said. ‘I love you,’ I told her, and as I smelt her skin, I knew I had never wanted anyone or anything more than I wanted her, but the craving for her was a anyone or anything more than I wanted her, but the craving for her was a terrifying one now. And I needed to keep underlining my point. ‘I love you, I love you, I love you.’ And after that, after the awkward shuffling away of that last thin layer of clothes, words retreated to the sounds they once were. We had sex. A happy entanglement of warm limbs and warmer love. A physical and psychological merging that conjured a kind of inner light, a bio-emotional phosphorescence, that was overwhelming in its gorgeousness. I wondered why they weren’t prouder of it. Of this magic. I wondered why, if they had to have flags, why they didn’t just opt for one with a picture of sex. Afterwards, I held her and she held me and I gently kissed her forehead as the wind beat against the window. She fell asleep. I watched her, in the dark. I wanted to protect her and keep her safe. Then I got out of bed. I had something to do. I am staying here. You can’t. You have gifts not made for that planet. Humans will become suspicious. Well then, I want to be disconnected. We cannot allow that. Yes, you can. You have to. The gifts are not compulsory. That is the point. I cannot allow my mind to be interfered with. We were not the ones interfering with your mind. We were trying to restore it. Isobel doesn’t know anything about the proof. She doesn’t know. Just leave her. Leave us. Leave us all. Please. Nothing will happen. You do not want immortality? You do not want the chance to return home or to visit anywhere else in the universe other than the lonely planet on which you now reside? That is right. You do not want the chance to take other forms? To return to your own original nature? No. I want to be a human. Or as close to being a human as it is possible for me to be. No one in all our histories has ever asked to lose the gifts. Well, it is a fact you must now update. You do realise what this means? Yes. You will be trapped in a body that cannot regenerate itself. You will grow old. You will get diseases. You will feel pain, and for ever know – unlike the rest of the ignorant species you want to belong to – that you have chosen that suffering. You have brought it on yourself. Yes. I know that. Very well. You have been given the ultimate punishment. And it makes it no less a punishment for having been asked for. You have now been disconnected. The gifts are gone. You are now human. If you declare you are from another planet you will never have proof. They will believe you are insane. And it makes no difference to us. It is easy to fill your place. You won’t fill my place. It is a waste of resources. There is no point to the mission. Hello? Are you listening? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello? The rhythm of life Love is what the humans are all about but they don’t understand it. If they understood it, then it would disappear. All I know is that it’s a frightening thing. And humans are very frightened of it, which is why they have quiz shows. To take their mind off it and think of something else. Love is scary because it pulls you in with an intense force, a supermassive black hole which looks like nothing from the outside but from the inside challenges every reasonable thing you know. You lose yourself, like I lost myself, in the warmest of annihilations. It makes you do stupid things – things that defy all logic. The opting for anguish over calm, for mortality over eternity, and for Earth over home. I awoke feeling terrible. My eyes itched with tiredness. My back was stiff. There was a pain in my knee, and I could hear a mild ringing. Noises that belonged below a planet’s surface were coming from my stomach. Overall, the sensation I was feeling was one of conscious decay. In short, I felt human. I felt forty-three years old. And now I had made the decision to stay I was full of anxiety. This anxiety was not just about my physical fate. It was the knowledge that at some point in the future the hosts were going to send someone else. And what would I be able to do, now that I had no more gifts than the average human? It was a worry, at first. But that gradually faded as time went by and nothing happened. Lesser worries began to occupy my mind. For instance, would I be able to cope with this life? What had once seemed exotic began to feel rather monotonous as things settled into a rhythm. It was the archetypal human one which went: wash, breakfast, check the Internet, work, lunch, work, dinner, talk, watch television, read a book, go to bed, pretend to be asleep, then actually sleep. Belonging as I did to a species which had only ever really known one day, there was initially something quite exciting about having any kind of rhythm at all. But now I was stuck here for good I began to resent humans’ lack of imagination. I believed they should have tried to add a little more variety into proceedings. I mean, this was the species whose main excuse for not doing something was ‘if only I had more time’. Perfectly valid until you realised they did have more time. Not eternity, granted, but they had tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow. And the day after the day after tomorrow. In fact I would have had to write ‘the day after’ thirty thousand times before a final ‘tomorrow’ in order to illustrate the amount of time on a human’s hands. The problem lying behind the lack of human fulfilment was a shortage not just of time but of imagination. They found a day that worked for them and then stuck to it, and repeated it, at least between Monday and Friday. Even if it didn’t work for them – as was usually the case – they stuck to it anyway. Then they’d alter things a bit and do something a little bit more fun on Saturday and Sunday. One initial proposal I wanted to put to them was to swap things over. For instance, have five fun days and two not-fun days. That way – call me a mathematical genius – they would have more fun. But as things stood, there weren’t even two fun days. They only had Saturdays, because Mondays were a little bit too close to Sundays for Sunday’s liking, as if Monday were a collapsed star in the week’s solar system, with an excessive gravitational pull. In other words one seventh of human days worked quite well. The other six weren’t very good, and five of those were roughly the same day stuck on repeat. The real difficulty, for me, was mornings. Mornings were hard on Earth. You woke up tireder than when you went to sleep. Your back ached. Your neck ached. Your chest felt tight with anxiety that came from being mortal. And then, on top of all that, you had to do so much before the day even started. The main problem was the stuff to do in order to be presentable. A human, typically, has to do the following things. He or she will get out of bed, sigh, stretch, go to the toilet, shower, shampoo their hair, condition their hair, wash their face, shave, deodorise, brush their teeth (with fluoride!), dry their hair, brush their hair, put on face cream, apply make-up, check everything in the mirror, choose clothes based on the weather and the situation, put on those clothes, check everything again in the mirror – and that’s just what happens before breakfast. It’s a wonder they ever get out of bed at all. But they do, repeatedly, thousands of times each. And not only that – they do it by themselves, with no technology to help them. Maybe a little electrical activity in their toothbrushes and hairdryers, but nothing more than that. And all to reduce body odour, and hairs, and halitosis, and shame. Teenagers Another thing adding force to the relentless gravity dogging this planet was all the worry that Isobel still had for Gulliver. She was pinching her bottom lip quite a lot, and staring vacantly out of windows. I had bought Gulliver a bass guitar, but the music he played was so gloomy it gave the house an unceasing soundtrack of despair. ‘I just keep thinking of things,’ said Isobel, when I told her that all this worry was unhealthy. ‘When he got expelled from school. He wanted it. He wanted to be expelled. It was a sort of academic suicide. I just worry, you know. He’s always been so bad at connecting with people. I can remember the first ever report he had at nursery school. It said he had resisted making any attachments. I mean, I know he’s had friends, but he’s always found it difficult. Shouldn’t there be girlfriends by now? He’s a good-looking boy.’ ‘Are friends so important? What’s the point of them?’ ‘Connections, Andrew. Think of Ari. Friends are how we connect to the world. I just worry, sometimes, that he’s not fixed here. To the world. To life. He reminds me of Angus.’ Angus, apparently, was her brother. He had ended his own life in his early thirties because of financial worries. I felt sad when she told me that. Sad for all the humans who find it easy to feel ashamed about things. They were not the only life form in the universe to have suicide, but they were one of the most enthusiastic about it. I wondered if I should tell her that he wasn’t going to school. I decided I should. ‘What?’ Isobel asked. But she had heard. ‘Oh God. So what’s he been doing?’ ‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Just walking around, I think.’ ‘Walking around?’ ‘When I saw him he was walking.’ She was angry now, and the music Gulliver was playing (quite loudly, by this point) wasn’t helping. And Newton was making me feel guilty with his eyes. ‘Listen, Isobel, let’s just—’ ‘Listen, Isobel, let’s just—’ It was too late. Isobel raced up the stairs. The inevitable row ensued. I could only hear Isobel’s voice. Gulliver’s was too quiet and low, deeper than the bass guitar. ‘Why haven’t you been to school?’ his mother shouted. I followed, with nausea in my stomach, and a dull ache in my heart. I was a traitor. He shouted at his mother, and his mother shouted back. He mentioned something about me getting him into fights but fortunately Isobel had no clue what he was talking about. ‘Dad, you bastard,’ he said to me at one point. ‘But the guitar. That was my idea.’ ‘So you’re buying me now?’ Teenagers, I realised, were really quite difficult. In the same way the south- eastern corner of the Derridean galaxy was difficult. His door slammed. I used the right tone of voice. ‘Gulliver, calm down. I am sorry. I am only trying to do what is best for you. I am learning here. Every day is a lesson, and some lessons I fail.’ It didn’t work. Unless working meant Gulliver kicking his own door with rage. Isobel eventually went downstairs, but I stayed there. An hour and thirty- eight minutes sitting on the beige wool carpet on the other side of the door. Newton came to join me. I stroked him. He licked my wrist with his rough tongue. I stayed right there, tilted my head towards the door. ‘I am sorry, Gulliver,’ I said. ‘I am sorry. I am sorry. And I am sorry I embarrassed you.’ Sometimes the only power you need is persistence. Eventually, he came out. He just looked at me, hands in pockets. He leant against the door-frame. ‘Did you do something on Facebook?’ ‘I might have done.’ He tried not to smile. He didn’t say much after that but he came downstairs and we all watched television together. It was a quiz show called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (As the show was aimed at humans, the question was rhetorical.) Then, shortly after, Gulliver went to the kitchen to see how much cereal and milk would fit into a bowl (more than you could imagine) and then he disappeared back to the attic. There was a feeling of something having been accomplished. Isobel told me she had booked us tickets to see an avant-garde production of Hamlet at the Arts Theatre. It was apparently about a suicidal young prince who wants to kill the man who has replaced his father. ‘Gulliver is staying at home,’ said Isobel. ‘That might be wise.’ ‘That might be wise.’ Australian wine ‘I’ve forgotten to take my tablets today.’ Isobel smiled. ‘Well, one evening off won’t hurt. Do you want a glass of wine?’ I hadn’t tried wine before so I said yes, as it really did seem to be a very revered substance. It was a mild night so Isobel poured me a glass and we sat outside in the garden. Newton decided to stay indoors. I looked at the transparent yellow liquid in the glass. I tasted it and tasted fermentation. In other words I tasted life on Earth. For everything that lives here ferments, ages, becomes diseased. But as things made their decline from ripeness they could taste wonderful, I realised. Then I considered the glass. The glass had been distilled from rock and so it knew things. It knew the age of the universe because it was the universe. I took another sip. After the third sip, I was really beginning to see the point, and it did something rather pleasant to the brain. I was forgetting the dull aches of my body and the sharp worries of my mind. By the end of the third glass I was very, very drunk. I was so drunk I looked to the sky and believed I could see two moons. ‘You do realise you’re drinking Australian wine, don’t you?’ she said. To which I may have replied ‘Oh.’ ‘You hate Australian wine.’ ‘Do I? Why?’ I said. ‘Because you’re a snob.’ ‘What’s a snob?’ She laughed, looked at me sideways. ‘Someone who didn’t used to sit down with his family to watch TV,’ she said. ‘Ever.’ ‘Oh.’ I drank some more. So did she. ‘Maybe I am becoming less of one,’ I said. ‘Anything is possible.’ She smiled. She was still exotic to me. That was obvious, but it was a pleasant exoticism now. Beyond pleasant, in fact. obvious, but it was a pleasant exoticism now. Beyond pleasant, in fact. ‘Actually, anything is possible,’ I told her, but didn’t go into the maths. She put her arm around me. I did not know the etiquette. Was this the moment I was meant to recite poetry written by dead people or was I meant to massage her anatomy? I did nothing. I just let her stroke my back as I stared upwards, beyond the thermosphere, and watched the two moons slide together and become one. The watcher The next day I had a hangover. I realised that if getting drunk was how people forgot they were mortal, then hangovers were how they remembered. I woke with a headache, a dry mouth, and a bad stomach. I left Isobel in bed and went downstairs for a glass of water, then I had a shower. I got dressed and went into the living room to read poetry. I had the strange but real sense that I was being watched. The sense grew and grew. I stood up, went to the window. Outside the street was empty. The large, static redbrick houses just stood there, like decharged crafts on a landing strip. But still I stayed looking. I thought I could see something reflected in one of the windows, a shape beside a car. A human shape, maybe. My eyes might have been playing tricks. I was hungover, after all. Newton pressed his nose into my knee. He released a curious high-pitched whine. ‘I don’t know,’ I said. I stared out of the glass again, away from reflections, to direct reality. And then I saw it. Dark, hovering just above that same parked car. I realised what it was. It was the top of a human head. I had been right. Someone was hiding from my stare. ‘Wait there,’ I told Newton. ‘Guard the house.’ I ran outside, across the drive and onto the street, just in time to see someone sprinting away around the next corner. A man, wearing jeans and a black top. Even from behind, and at a distance, the man struck me as familiar, but I couldn’t think where I had seen him. I turned the corner, but there was no one there. It was just another empty suburban street, and a long one. Too long for the person to have run down. Well, it wasn’t quite empty. There was an old human female, walking towards me, dragging a shopping trolley. I stopped running. ‘Hello,’ she said, smiling. Her skin was creased with age, in the way typical of the species. (The best way to think of the ageing process in relation to a human face is to imagine a map of an area of innocent land which slowly becomes a city with many long and winding routes.) with many long and winding routes.) I think she knew me. ‘Hello,’ I said back. ‘How are you now?’ I was looking around, trying to assess the possible escape routes. If they had slid down one of the passageways then they could have been anywhere. There were about two hundred obvious possibilities. ‘I’m, I’m fine,’ I said. ‘Fine.’ My eyes darted around but were unrewarded. Who was this man? I wondered. And where was he from? Occasionally, in the days that followed, I would have that feeling again, of being watched. But I never caught a glimpse of my watcher, which was strange, and led me to only two possibilities. Either I was becoming too dull-witted and human, or the person I was looking for, the one who I could sometimes feel watching me in university corridors and in supermarkets, was too sharp-witted to be caught. In other words: something not human. I tried to convince myself that this was ridiculous. I was almost able to convince myself that my own mind was ridiculous, and that I had never actually been anything other than human. That I really was Professor Andrew Martin and that every other thing had been a kind of dream. Yes, I could almost do that. Almost. How to see for ever That it will never come again, Is what makes life so sweet. – Emily Dickinson Isobel was at her laptop, in the living room. An American friend of hers wrote a blog about ancient history and Isobel was contributing a comment about an article on Mesopotamia. I watched her, mesmerised. The Earth’s moon was a dead place, with no atmosphere. It had no way of healing its scars. Not like Earth, or its inhabitants. I was amazed, the way time mended things so quickly on this planet. I looked at Isobel and I saw a miracle. It was ridiculous, I know. But a human, in its own small way, was a kind of miraculous achievement, in mathematical terms. For a start, it wasn’t very likely that Isobel’s mother and father would have met. And even if they had met the chances of their having a baby would have been pretty slim, given the numerous agonies surrounding the human dating process. Her mother would have had about a hundred thousand eggs ovulating inside her, and her father would have had five trillion sperm during that same length of time. But even then, even that one in five hundred million million million chance of existing was a terrible understatement, and nowhere near did the coincidence of a human life justice. You see, when you looked at a human’s face, you had to comprehend the luck that brought that person there. Isobel Martin had a total of 150,000 generations before her, and that only includes the humans. That was 150,000 increasingly unlikely copulations resulting in increasingly unlikely children. That was a one in quadrillion chance multiplied by another quadrillion for every generation. Or around twenty thousand times more than the number of the atoms in the universe. But even that was only the start of it, because humans had only been around for three million Earth years, certainly a very short time compared to the three and a half billion years since life first appeared on this planet. Therefore, mathematically, rounding things up, there was no chance at all that Isobel Martin could have existed. A zero in tento-the-power-of-forever chance. And yet there she was, in front of me, and I was quite taken aback by it all; I really was. Suddenly it made me realise why religion was such a big thing around here. Because, yes, sure, God could not exist. But then neither could humans. So, if they believed in themselves – the logic must go – why not believe in something that was only a fraction more unlikely? I don’t know how long I looked at her like this. ‘What’s going through your mind?’ she asked me, closing the laptop. (This is an important detail. Remember: she closed the laptop.) ‘Oh, just things.’ ‘Tell me.’ ‘Well, I’m thinking about how life is so miraculous none of it really deserves the title “reality”.’ ‘Andrew, I’m a little taken aback about how your whole worldview has become so romantic.’ It was ridiculous that I had ever failed to see it. She was beautiful. A forty-one-year-old, poised delicately between the young woman she had been and the older one she would become. This intelligent, wound-dabbing historian. This person who would buy someone else’s shopping with no other motive than simply to help. I knew other things now. I knew she’d been a screaming baby, a child learning to walk, a girl at school eager to learn, a teenager listening to Talking Heads in her bedroom while reading books by A.J.P. Taylor. I knew she’d been a university student studying the past and trying to interpret its patterns. She’d been, simultaneously, a young woman in love, full of a thousand hopes, trying to read the future as well as the past. She had then taught British and European history, the big pattern she had discovered being the one that revealed that the civilisations that advanced with the Enlightenment did so through violence and territorial conquest more than through scientific progress, political modernisation and philosophical understanding. She had then tried to uncover the woman’s place in this history, and it had been difficult because history had always been written by the victors of wars, and the victors of the gender wars had always been male, and so women had been placed in the margins and in the footnotes, if they had been lucky. been placed in the margins and in the footnotes, if they had been lucky. And yet the irony was that she soon placed herself in the margins voluntarily, giving up work for family, because she imagined that when she eventually arrived at her death-bed she would feel more regret about unborn children than unwritten books. But as soon as she made that move, she had felt her husband begin to take her for granted. She had stuff to give, but it was ungiven; it was locked away. And I felt an incredible excitement at being able to witness the love re-emerge inside her, because it was a total, prime-of-life love. The kind that could only be possible in someone who was going to die at some point in the future, and also someone who had lived enough to know that loving and being loved back was a hard thing to get right, but when you managed it you could see forever. Two mirrors, opposite and facing each other at perfectly parallel angles, viewing themselves through the other, the view as deep as infinity. Yes, that was what love was for. (I may not have understood marriage, but I understood love, I was sure of it.) Love was a way to live forever in a single moment, and it was also a way to see yourself as you had never actually seen yourself, and made you realise – having done so – that this view was a more meaningful one than any of your previous self-perceptions and selfdeceptions. Even though, the big joke was, indeed the very biggest joke in the universe was, that Isobel Martin believed I had always been a human called Andrew Martin who had been born one hundred miles away in Sheffield, and not in fact 8653178431 light years away. ‘Isobel, I think I should tell you something. It is something very important.’ She looked worried. ‘What? What is it?’ There was an imperfection in her lower lip. The left side of it slightly fuller than the right. It was a fascinating detail on a face that only had fascinating details. How could I have ever found her hideous? How? How? I couldn’t do it. Say it. I should have, but I didn’t. ‘I think we should buy a new sofa,’ I said. ‘That’s the important thing you want to tell me?’ ‘Yes. I don’t like it. I don’t like purple.’ ‘Don’t you?’ ‘No. It’s too close to violet. All those short wavelength colours mess with my brain.’ ‘You are funny. “Short wavelength colours.” ’ ‘Well, that’s what they are.’ ‘But purple is the colour of emperors. And you’ve always acted like an emperor so . . .’ ‘Is it? Why?’ ‘Is it? Why?’ ‘Byzantine empresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber. Their babies were given the honorary title “Porphyrogenitos” which meant “Born to the Purple” to separate them from riff-raff generals who won the throne through going to war. But then, in Japan, purple is the colour of death.’ I was mesmerised by her voice when she spoke about historical things. It had a delicacy to it, each sentence a long thin arm carrying the past as if it were porcelain. Something that could be brought out and presented in front of you but which could break and become a million pieces at any moment. I realised even her being a historian was part of her caring nature. ‘Well, I just think we could do with some new furniture,’ I said. ‘Do you now?’ she asked, staring deep into my eyes in a mockserious way. One of the brighter humans, a German-born theoretical physicist called Albert Einstein, explained relativity to dimmer members of his species by telling them: ‘Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute.’ What if looking at the pretty girl felt like putting your hand on a hot stove? What was that? Quantum mechanics? After a period of time, she leant towards me and kissed me. I had kissed her before. But now the lightening effect on my stomach was very like fear. Indeed, it was every symptom of fear, but a pleasurable fear. An enjoyable danger. She smiled, and told me a story she had once read not in a history book but in a terrible magazine at the doctor’s. A husband and a wife who had fallen out of love had their own separate affairs on the Internet. It was only when they came to meet their illicit lovers that they realised they had actually been having an affair with each other. But far from tearing the marriage apart it restored it, and they lived more happily than before. ‘I have something to tell you,’ I said, after this story. ‘What?’ ‘I love you.’ ‘I love you, too.’ ‘Yes, but it is impossible to love you.’ ‘Thank you. Precisely what a girl likes to hear.’ ‘No. I mean, because of where I come from. No one there can love.’ ‘What? Sheffield? It’s not that bad.’ ‘No. Listen, this is new to me. I’m scared.’ She held my head in her hands, as if it were another delicate thing she wanted to preserve. She was a human. She knew one day her husband would die and yet she still dared to love him. That was an amazing thing. We kissed some more. We kissed some more. Kissing was very much like eating. But instead of reducing the appetite the food consumed actually increased it. The food wasn’t matter, it had no mass, and yet it seemed to convert into a very delicious energy inside me. ‘Let’s go upstairs,’ she said. She said the word suggestively, as though upstairs wasn’t just a place but an alternate reality, made from a different texture of space-time. A pleasure land we would enter via a worm hole on the sixth stair. And, of course, she was absolutely right. Afterwards, we lay there for a few minutes, and then she decided we needed some music. ‘Anything,’ I said, ‘but The Planets.’ ‘That’s the only piece of music you like.’ ‘Not anymore.’ So she put on something called ‘Love Theme’ by Ennio Morricone. It was sad, but beautiful. ‘Can you remember when we saw Cinema Paradiso?’ ‘Yes,’ I lied. ‘You hated it. You said it was so sentimental you wanted to throw up. You said it cheapens emotion to have it exaggerated and fetishised like that. Not that you’ve ever wanted to watch emotional things. I think, if I dare say it, you have always been scared of emotion, and so saying that you don’t like sentimentality is a way of saying you don’t like feeling emotion.’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘don’t worry. That me is dead.’ She smiled. She didn’t seem worried at all. But of course she should have been. We all should have been. And just how worried we should have been would become clear to me only a few hours later. The intruder She woke me in the middle of the night. ‘I think I heard someone,’ she said. Her voice indicated a tightness of the vocal folds within her larynx. It was fear disguised as calm. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I swear to God, Andrew. I think there’s someone in the house.’ ‘You might have heard Gulliver.’ ‘No. Gulliver hasn’t come downstairs. I’ve been awake.’ I waited in the near-darkness, and then I heard something. Footsteps. It very much sounded like someone was walking around our living room. The clock’s digital display beamed 04:22. I pulled back the duvet and got out of bed. I looked at Isobel. ‘Just stay there. Whatever happens, stay right there.’ ‘Be careful,’ Isobel said. She switched on her bedside light and looked for the phone that was usually in its cradle on the table. But it wasn’t there. ‘That’s weird.’ I left the room and waited a moment on the landing. There was silence now. The silence that can only exist in houses at twenty past four in the morning. It struck me then just how primitive life was here, with houses that could not do anything to protect themselves. In short, I was terrified. Slowly and quietly I tiptoed downstairs. A normal person would probably have switched the hallway light on, but I didn’t. This wasn’t for my benefit, but for Isobel’s. If she came down and saw whoever it was, and they saw her, well, that could have been a very dangerous situation. Also, it would have been unwise to alert the intruder of my presence downstairs – if they hadn’t already been alerted. And so it was that I crept into the kitchen and saw Newton sleeping soundly (maybe even suspiciously so) in his basket. As far as I could tell, no one else had been in here, or the utility room, and so I left to check the sitting room. No one was there, or no one that I could see anyway. There were just books, the sofa, an empty fruit bowl, a desk and a radio. So then I went along the hallway to sofa, an empty fruit bowl, a desk and a radio. So then I went along the hallway to the living room. This time, before I opened the door I sensed strongly that someone was there. But without the gifts I had no idea if my senses were fooling me. I opened the door. As I did so, I felt a deep fear lightening my whole body. Prior to taking human form, I had never experienced such a feeling. What had we Vonnadorians ever had to be scared of, in a world without death or loss or uncontrollable pain? Again, I saw only furniture. The sofa, the chairs, the switched-off television, the coffee table. No one was there, not at that moment, but we had definitely been visited. I knew this because Isobel’s laptop was on the coffee table. This, alone, wasn’t worrying, as she had left it there last night. What worried me, though, was that it was open. She had closed it. But not only that. The light emission. Even though the computer was facing away from me I could see that the screen was glowing, which meant someone had been using it within the last two minutes. I quickly went around the coffee table to see what was on the screen, but nothing had been deleted. I closed the laptop and went upstairs. ‘What was it?’ Isobel asked, as I slid back into bed. ‘Oh, it was nothing. We must have been hearing things.’ And Isobel fell asleep as I stared up at the ceiling, wishing I had a god who could hear my prayers. Perfect time The next morning Gulliver brought his guitar downstairs and played a bit for us. He had learnt an old piece of music by a band known as Nirvana called ‘All Apologies’. With intense concentration on his face, he kept perfect time. He was very good, and we applauded him afterwards. For a moment, I forgot every worry. A king of infinite space It turned out that Hamlet was quite a depressing thing to watch when you had just given up immortality and were worried that someone was watching you. The best bit came half-way through when he looked up at the sky. ‘Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in the shape of a camel?’ he asked. ‘By th’ Mass,’ said another man, a curtain-fetishist called Polonius, ‘and ’tis like a camel, indeed.’ ‘Methinks it is like a weasel,’ said Hamlet. ‘It is backed like a weasel.’ Then Hamlet squinted and scratched his head. ‘Or like a whale.’ And Polonius, who wasn’t really in tune with Hamlet’s surreal sense of humour: ‘Very like a whale.’ Afterwards, we went out to a restaurant. It was called Tito’s. I had a bread salad called ‘panzanella’. It had anchovies in it. Anchovies were a fish, so I spent the first five minutes carefully taking them out and laying them on the side of the plate, offering them silent words of grief. ‘You seemed to enjoy the play,’ said Isobel. I thought I would lie. ‘I did. Yes. Did you?’ ‘No. It was awful. I think it was fundamentally wrong to have the Prince of Denmark played by a TV gardener.’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘you’re right. It was really bad.’ She laughed. She seemed more relaxed than I had ever seen her. Less worried about me, and Gulliver. ‘There’s a lot of death in it, as well,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ ‘Are you scared of death?’ She looked awkward. ‘Of course, I’m scared to death of death. I’m a lapsed Catholic. Death and guilt. That’s all I have.’ Catholicism, I discovered, was a type of Christianity for humans who like gold leaf, Latin and guilt. ‘Well, I think you do amazingly. Considering that your body is starting a slow process of physical deterioration leading ultimately to . . .’ process of physical deterioration leading ultimately to . . .’ ‘Okay, okay. Thank you. Enough death.’ ‘But I thought you liked thinking about death. I thought that’s why we saw Hamlet.’ ‘I like my death on a stage. Not over my penne arrabiata.’ So we talked and drank red wine as people came and left the restaurant. She told me of the module she was being cajoled into teaching next year. Early Civilised Life in the Aegean. ‘They keep trying to push me further and further back in time. Think they’re trying to tell me something. Next it will be Early Civilised Diplodocuses.’ She laughed. So I laughed too. ‘You should get that novel published,’ I said, trying a different tack. ‘Wider Than the Sky. It’s good. What I’ve read of it.’ ‘I don’t know. That one was a bit private. Very personal. Of its time. I was in a dark place. That was when you were . . . well, you know. We’re over that now. I feel like a different person now. Almost like I’m married to a different person too.’ ‘Well, you should write fiction again.’ ‘Oh, I don’t know. It’s getting the ideas.’ I didn’t want to tell her that I had quite a lot of ideas I could give her. ‘We haven’t done this for years, have we?’ she said. ‘Done what?’ ‘Talk. Like this. It feels like a first date or something. In a good way. It feels like I’m getting to know you.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘God,’ she said wistfully. She was drunk now. So was I, even though I was still on my first glass. ‘Our first date,’ she went on. ‘Can you remember?’ ‘Of course. Of course.’ ‘It was here. But it was an Indian then. What was its name? . . . The Taj Mahal. You’d changed your mind on the phone after I wasn’t too impressed at the Pizza Hut suggestion. Cambridge didn’t even have a Pizza Express back then. God . . . twenty years. Can you believe it? Talk about the compression of time through memory. I remember it better than anything. I was late. You waited an hour for me. Out in the rain. I thought that was so romantic.’ She looked off into the distance, as though twenty years ago were a physical thing that could be seen sitting at a table in the corner of the room. And as I stared at those eyes, which were loitering somewhere in the infinity between past and present, happy and sad, I deeply wanted to have been that person she was talking about. The one who had braved the rain and got soaked to the skin two talking about. The one who had braved the rain and got soaked to the skin two decades ago. But I wasn’t that person. And I would never be him. I felt like Hamlet. I had absolutely no idea what to do. ‘He must have loved you,’ I said. She stopped daydreaming. Was suddenly alert. ‘What?’ ‘I,’ I said, staring down at my slow-melting limoncello ice-cream. ‘And I still love you. As much as I did then. I was just, you know, seeing us, the past, in the third person. Distance of time . . .’ She held my hand across the table. Squeezed it. For a second I could dream I was Professor Andrew Martin, just as easily as a TV gardener could dream he was Hamlet. ‘Can you remember when we used to go punting on the Cam?’ she asked. ‘That time you fell in the water . . . God, we were drunk. Can you remember? While we were still here, before you had that Princeton offer and we went to America. We really had fun, didn’t we?’ I nodded, but I felt uncomfortable. Also, I didn’t want to leave Gulliver on his own any longer. I asked for the bill. ‘Listen,’ I said, as we walked out of the restaurant, ‘there’s something I really feel obliged to let you know . . .’ ‘What?’ she asked, looking up at me. Holding on to my arm as she flinched at the wind. ‘What is it?’ I breathed deeply, filling my lungs, seeking courage somewhere in the nitrogen and the oxygen. In my mind I ran through the pieces of information I had to give her. I am not from here. In fact, I am not even your husband. I am from another planet, in another solar system, in a distant galaxy. ‘The thing is . . . well, the thing is . . .’ ‘Think we should probably cross the road,’ said Isobel, tugging my arm, as two silhouettes – a shouting female and a male – came towards us on the pavement. So we did, crossing at an angle that tried to balance the concealment of fear with rapid avoidance – that angle being, as it was everywhere in the universe, 48 degrees away from the straight line on which we had been travelling. Midway across that carless road I turned and saw her. Zoë. The woman from the hospital I had met on my first day on this planet. She was still shouting at the large, muscular, shaven-headed man. The man had a tattoo of a tear on his face. I remembered her confession of her love of violent men. ‘I’m telling you, you’ve got it wrong! You’re the one that’s crazy! Not me! But if you want to go around like a primitive life form that’s fine! Do it, you But if you want to go around like a primitive life form that’s fine! Do it, you thick piece of shit!’ ‘You pretentious, cock-munching slag!’ And then she saw me. The art of letting go ‘It’s you,’ Zoë said. ‘You know her?’ whispered Isobel. ‘I’m afraid . . . yes. From the hospital.’ ‘Oh no.’ ‘Please,’ I said to the man, ‘be nice.’ The man was staring at me. His shaven head, along with the rest of his body, came towards me. ‘And what on Earth has it got to do with you?’ ‘On Earth,’ I said, ‘it’s nice to see people getting on together.’ ‘You fuckin’ what?’ ‘Just turn around,’ Isobel said fearlessly, ‘and leave everyone alone. Seriously, if you do anything else you’ll just regret it in the morning.’ It was then he turned to Isobel and held her face, squeezing her cheeks hard, distorting her beauty. Anger flared inside me as he said to her, ‘Shut your fucking mouth, you meddling bitch.’ Isobel now had fear-swollen eyes. There were rational things to do here, I was sure, but I had come a long way since rationality. ‘Leave us all alone,’ I said, momentarily forgetting that my words were just that. Words. He looked at me and he laughed. And with that laughter came the terrifying knowledge that I had no power whatsoever. The gifts had been taken from me. I was, to all intents and purposes, no more equipped for a fight with a giant gym- bodied thug than the average human professor of mathematics, which wasn’t particularly well equipped at all. He beat me. And it was a proper beating. Not the kind Gulliver had given me, and which I had opted to feel. No. If there had been an option not to feel the cheap metal rings of this man’s fist collide into my face with comet-like force then I would have taken that option. As I would have done only moments later when I was on the ground receiving a kick in the stomach, rapidly unsettling the when I was on the ground receiving a kick in the stomach, rapidly unsettling the undigested Italian food residing there, followed by the final piece of brutalist punctuation – the kick to the head. More of a stamp, actually. After that, there was nothing. There was darkness, and Hamlet. This was your husband. Look you now what follows. I heard Isobel wailing. I tried to speak to her, but words were hard to reach. The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. I could hear the rise and fall of a siren, and knew it was for me. Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear. I woke, in the ambulance, and there was only her. Her face above me, like a sun that eyes could stand, and she stroked my hand as she had once stroked my hand the first time I’d met her. ‘I love you,’ she said. And I knew the point of love right then. The point of love was to help you survive. The point was also to forget meaning. To stop looking and start living. The meaning was to hold the hand of someone you cared about and to live inside the present. Past and future were myths. The past was just the present that had died and the future would never exist anyway, because by the time we got to it the future would have turned into the present. The present was all there was. The ever-moving, ever-changing present. And the present was fickle. It could only be caught by letting go. So I let go. I let go of everything in the universe. Everything, except her hand. Neuroadaptive activity I woke up in the hospital. It was the first time in my life I had woken in serious physical pain. It was night-time. Isobel had stayed for a while and had fallen asleep in a plastic chair. But she had now been told to go home. So I was alone, with my pain, feeling how truly helpless it was to be a human. And I stayed awake in the dark, urging the Earth to rotate faster and faster so that it could be facing the sun again. For the tragedy of night to become the comedy of day. I wasn’t used to night. Of course, I had experienced it on other planets but Earth had the darkest nights I had ever experienced. Not the longest, but the deepest, the loneliest, the most tragically beautiful. I consoled myself with random prime numbers. 73. 131. 977. 1213. 83719. Each as indivisible as love, except by one and itself. I struggled to think of higher primes. Even my mathematical skills had abandoned me, I realised. They tested my ribs, my eyes, my ears, and inside my mouth. They tested my brain and my heart. My heart had caused no concern, though they did consider forty-nine beats per minute to be a little on the slow side. As for my brain, they were a little concerned about my medial temporal lobe, as there seemed to be some unusual neuroadaptive activity taking place. ‘It’s as though there has been something taken out of your brain and your cells are trying to over-compensate, but clearly nothing has been taken out or damaged. But it is very strange.’ I nodded. Of course, something had been taken out, but I also knew it was nothing any human, Earth-based doctor would ever be able to understand. It had been a difficult test, but I had passed it. I was as good as human. And they gave me some paracetamol and codeine for the pain which still pulsated inside my head and on my face. Eventually, I went home. The next day, Ari came to visit me. I was in bed. Isobel was at work and Gulliver was, quite genuinely it seemed, at school. Gulliver was, quite genuinely it seemed, at school. ‘Man, you look fucking terrible.’ I smiled, lifted the bag of frozen peas from the side of my head. ‘Which is a coincidence, because I feel fucking terrible too.’ ‘You should’ve gone to the police.’ ‘Well, yes, I was thinking about it. Isobel thinks I should. But I have a little bit of a phobia about police. You know, ever since I was arrested for not wearing clothes.’ ‘Yeah, well, you can’t have psychos roaming around pulverising anyone they feel like.’ ‘No, I know. I know.’ ‘Listen, mate, I just want to say that was big of you. That was old-school gentleman, defending your wife like that and, you know, kudos for it. It surprised me. I’m not putting you down or anything, but I didn’t know you were that kind of shining-armour guy.’ ‘Well, I’ve changed. I have a lot of activity in my medial temporal lobe. I think it’s probably to do with that.’ Ari looked doubtful. ‘Well, whatever it is, you’re becoming a man of honour. And that’s rare for mathematicians. It’s always been us physicists who’ve had the big cojones, traditionally. Just don’t screw it up with Isobel. You know what I mean?’ I looked at Ari for a long time. He was a good man, I could see that. I could trust him. ‘Listen, Ari, you know that thing I was going to tell you. At the café at the college?’ ‘When you had that migraine?’ ‘Yes,’ I hesitated. I was disconnected, so I knew I could tell him. Or thought I could. ‘I am from another planet, in another solar system, in another galaxy.’ Ari laughed. It was a loud, deep blast of laughter without a single note of doubt. ‘Okay, ET, so you’ll be wanting to phone home now. If we’ve got a connection that reaches the Andromeda galaxy.’ ‘It’s not the Andromeda galaxy. It’s further away. Many, many light years.’ This sentence was hardly heard as Ari was laughing so much. He stared at me with fake blankness. ‘So how did you get here? Space ship? Wormhole?’ ‘No. I didn’t travel in any conventional way you would understand. It was anti-matter technology. Home is forever away, but it is also only a second away. Though now, I can never go back.’ It was no good. Ari, a man who believed in the possibility of alien life, still could not accept the idea when it was standing – or lying – right in front of him. ‘You see, I had special talents, as a result of technology. The gifts.’ ‘Go on then,’ Ari said, controlling his laughter, ‘show me.’ ‘Go on then,’ Ari said, controlling his laughter, ‘show me.’ ‘I can’t. I have no powers now. I am exactly like a human.’ Ari found this bit especially funny. He was annoying me now. He was still a good man, but good men could be annoying, I realised. ‘Exactly like a human! Well, man, you’re fucked then, aren’t you?’ I nodded. ‘Yes. I think I might be.’ Ari smiled, looked concerned. ‘Listen, make sure you keep taking all the tablets. Not just the painkillers. All of them, yeah?’ I nodded. He thought I was mad. Maybe it would be easier if I could take on this view myself, the delusion that it was a delusion. If one day I could wake up and believe it was all a dream. ‘Listen,’ I said. ‘I’ve researched you. I know you understand quantum physics, and I know you’ve written about simulation theory. You say there’s a thirty per cent chance that none of this is real. You told me in the café you believed in aliens. So I know you can believe this.’ Ari shook his head, but at least he wasn’t laughing now. ‘No. You’re wrong. I can’t.’ ‘That’s okay,’ I said, realising that if Ari wouldn’t believe me Isobel never would. But Gulliver. There was always Gulliver. One day I would tell him the truth. But what then? Could he accept me as a father, knowing I had lied? I was trapped. I had to lie, and to stay lying. ‘But, Ari,’ I said, ‘if I ever need a favour, if I ever need Gulliver and Isobel to stay at your house – would that be okay?’ He smiled. ‘Sure, mate, sure.’ Platykurtic distribution The next day, still swollen with bruises, I was back at the college. There was something about being in the house, even with Newton for company, that troubled me. It never had before, but now it made me feel incredibly lonely. So I went to work, and I realised why work was so important on Earth. It stopped you feeling lonely. But loneliness was there for me, waiting in my office, which was where I’d returned after my lecture on distribution models. But my head hurt and I must admit I did quite welcome the peace. After a while there was a knock on the door. I ignored it. Loneliness minus a headache was my preferred option. But then it happened again. And it happened in such a way that I knew it was going to keep on happening, and so I stood up and went to the door. And, after a while, I opened it. A young woman was there. It was Maggie. The wild flower in bloom. The one with the curly red hair and the full lips. She was twirling her hair around her finger again. She was breathing deeply, and seemed to be inhaling a different kind of air – one which contained a mysterious aphrodisiac, promising euphoria. And she was smiling. ‘So,’ she said. I waited a minute for the rest of the sentence but it didn’t happen. ‘So’ was beginning, middle and end. It meant something, but I didn’t know what. ‘What do you want?’ I asked. She smiled again. Bit her lip. ‘To discuss the compatibility of bell curves and platykurtic distribution models.’ ‘Right.’ ‘Platykurtic,’ she added, running a finger down my shirt towards my trousers. ‘From the Greek. Platus meaning flat, kurtos meaning . . . bulging.’ ‘Oh.’ Her finger danced away from me. ‘So, Jake LaMotta, let’s go.’ ‘My name is not Jake LaMotta.’ ‘I know. I was referencing your face.’ ‘I know. I was referencing your face.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘So, are we going?’ ‘Where?’ ‘Hat and Feathers.’ I had no idea what she was talking about. Or indeed, who she actually was to me, or to the man who had been Professor Andrew Martin. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘let’s go.’ That was it, right there. My first mistake of the day. But by no means the last. The Hat and Feathers I soon discovered the Hat and Feathers was a misleading name. In it there was no hat, and absolutely no feathers. There were just heavily inebriated people with red faces laughing at their own jokes. This, I soon discovered, was a typical pub. The ‘pub’ was an invention of humans living in England, designed as compensation for the fact that they were humans living in England. I rather liked the place. ‘Let’s find a quiet corner,’ she said to me, this young Maggie. There were lots of corners, as there always seemed to be in human-made environments. Earth dwellers still seemed to be a long way off from understanding the link between straight lines and acute forms of psychosis, which might explain why pubs seemed to be full of aggressive people. There were straight lines running into each other all over the place. Every table, every chair, at the bar, at the ‘fruit machine’. (I enquired about these machines. Apparently they were aimed at men whose fascination with flashing squares of light was coupled with a poor grasp of probability theory.) With so many corners to choose from, it was a surprise to see us sit near a straight, continuous piece of wall, at an oval table and on circular stools. ‘This is perfect,’ she said. ‘Is it?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Right.’ ‘What would you like?’ ‘Liquid nitrogen,’ I replied thoughtlessly. ‘A whisky and soda?’ ‘Yes. One of them.’ And we drank and chatted like old friends, which I think we were. Though her conversational approach seemed quite different from Isobel’s. ‘Your penis is everywhere,’ she said at one point. I looked around. ‘Is it?’ ‘Two hundred and twenty thousand hits on YouTube.’‘Right,’ I said. ‘They’ve blurred it out, though. Quite a wise move, I would say, from first- hand experience.’ She laughed even more at this. It was a laugh that did nothing to relieve the pain pressing into and out of my face. I changed the mood. I asked her what it meant, for her, to be a human. I wanted to ask the whole world this question, but, right now, she would do. And so she told me. The ideal castle She said being human is being a young child on Christmas Day who receives an absolutely magnificent castle. And there is a perfect photograph of this castle on the box and you want more than anything to play with the castle and the knights and the princesses because it looks like such a perfectly human world, but the only problem is that the castle isn’t built. It’s in tiny intricate pieces, and although there’s a book of instructions you don’t understand it. And nor can your parents or Aunt Sylvie. So you are just left, crying at the ideal castle on the box which no one would ever be able to build. Somewhere else I thanked Maggie for this interpretation. And then I explained to her that I thought the meaning was coming to me, the more I forgot it. After that, I spoke a lot about Isobel. This seemed to irritate her, and she switched the subject. ‘After this,’ she said, circling the top of her glass with her finger, ‘are we going somewhere else?’ I recognised the tone of this ‘somewhere else’. It had the exact same frequency as Isobel’s use of the word ‘upstairs’ the Saturday before. ‘Are we going to have sex?’ She laughed some more. Laughter, I realised, was the reverberating sound of a truth hitting a lie. Humans existed inside their own delusions and laughing was a way out – the only possible bridge they had between each other. That, and love. But there was no love between me and Maggie, I want you to know that. Anyway, it turned out we were going to have sex. So we left and walked along a few streets until we reached Willow Road and her flat. Her flat, by the way, was the messiest thing I had ever seen that hadn’t been a direct result of nuclear fission. A supercluster of books, clothes, empty wine bottles, stubbed- out cigarettes, old toast and unopened envelopes. I discovered that her full name was Margaret Lowell. I wasn’t an expert on Earth names, but I still knew this was wildly inappropriate. She should have been called Lana Bellcurve or Ashley Brainsex or something. Anyway, apparently I never called her Margaret. (‘No one except my broadband provider calls me that.’) She was Maggie. And Maggie, it transpired, was an unconventional human. For instance, when asked about her religion, she answered ‘Pythagorean’. She was ‘well travelled’, the most ridiculous expression if you belonged to a species that had only left its own planet to visit its moon (and Maggie, it transpired, hadn’t even been there). In this case, it merely meant she had taught English in Spain, Tanzania and various parts of South America for four years before returning to study maths. She also seemed to have a very limited sense of body shame, by human standards, and had worked as a lap dancer to pay for her undergraduate studies. standards, and had worked as a lap dancer to pay for her undergraduate studies. She wanted to have sex on the floor, which was an intensely uncomfortable way of having it. As we unclothed each other we kissed, but this wasn’t the kind of kissing that brought you closer, the kind that Isobel was good at. This was self-referential kissing, kissing about kissing, dramatic and fast and pseudo- intense. It also hurt. My face was still tender and Maggie’s meta-kisses didn’t really seem to accommodate the possibility of pain. And then we were naked, or rather the parts of us which needed to be naked were naked, and it started to feel more like a strange kind of fighting than anything else. I looked at her face, and her neck, and her breasts, and was reminded of the fundamental strangeness of the human body. With Isobel, I had never felt like I was sleeping with an alien, but with Maggie the level of exoticism bordered on terror. There was physiological pleasure, quite a good deal of it at times, but it was a very localised, anatomical kind of pleasure. I smelt her skin, and I liked the smell of it, a mixture of coconut-scented lotion and bacteria, but my mind felt terrible, for a reason that involved more than my head pain. Almost immediately after we had started having sex I had a queasy sensation in my stomach, as though the altitude had drastically changed. I stopped. I got away from her. ‘What’s the matter?’ she asked me. ‘I don’t know. But something is. This feels wrong. I realise I don’t want to have an orgasm right now.’ ‘Bit late for a crisis of conscience.’ I really didn’t know what the matter was. After all, it was just sex. I got dressed and discovered there were four missed calls on my mobile phone. ‘Goodbye, Maggie.’ She laughed some more. ‘Give my love to your wife.’ I had no idea what was so funny, but I decided to be polite and laughed too as I stepped outside into cool evening air, which was tainted with maybe a little more carbon dioxide than I had noticed before. Places beyond logic ‘You’re home late,’ Isobel said. ‘I’ve been worried. I thought that man might have come after you.’ ‘What man?’ ‘That brute who smashed your face in.’ She was in the living room, at home, its walls lined with books about history and mathematics. Mainly mathematics. She was placing pens in a pot. She was staring at me with harsh eyes. Then she softened a bit. ‘How was your day?’ ‘Oh,’ I said, putting down my bag, ‘it was okay. I did some teaching. I met some students. I had sex with that person. My student. The one called Maggie.’ It’s funny, I had a sensation these words were taking me somewhere, into a dangerous valley, but still I said them. Isobel, meanwhile, took a little time to process this information, even by human standards. The queasy feeling in my stomach hadn’t gone away. If anything, it had intensified. ‘That’s not very funny.’ ‘I wasn’t trying to be funny.’ She studied me for a long while. Then dropped a fountain pen on the floor. The lid came off. Ink sprayed. ‘What are you talking about?’ I told her again. The bit she seemed most interested in was the last part, about me having sex with Maggie. Indeed, she was so interested that she started to hyperventilate and throw the pen pot in the direction of my head. And then she began to cry. ‘Why are you crying?’ I said, but I was beginning to understand. I moved closer to her. It was then she launched an attack on me, her hands moving as fast as laws of anatomical motion allow. Her fingernails scratched my face, adding fresh wounds. Then she just stood there, looking at me, as if she had wounds too. Invisible ones. ‘I’m sorry, Isobel, you have to understand, I didn’t realise I was doing anything wrong. This is all new. You don’t know how alien all this is to me. I know it is morally wrong to love another woman, but I don’t love her. It was just pleasure. The way a peanut butter sandwich is pleasure. You don’t realise the pleasure. The way a peanut butter sandwich is pleasure. You don’t realise the complexity and hypocrisy of this system . . .’ She had stopped. Her breathing slowed and deepened, and her first question became her only one. ‘Who is she?’ And then: ‘Who is she?’ And soon after: ‘Who is she?’ I was reluctant to speak. Speaking to a human you cared about, I realised, was so fraught with hidden danger that it was a wonder people bothered speaking at all. I could have lied. I could have backtracked. But I realised lying, though essential to keep someone in love with you, actually wasn’t what my love demanded. It demanded truth. So I said, in the simplest words I could find, ‘I don’t know. But I don’t love her. I love you. I didn’t realise that it was such a big thing. I sort of knew, as it was happening. My stomach told me, in a way it never tells me with peanut butter. And then I stopped.’ The only time I’d come across the concept of infidelity was in Cosmopolitan magazine, and they really hadn’t done enough to explain it properly. They’d sort of said it depends on the context and, you see, it was such an alien concept for me to understand. It was like trying to get a human to understand transcellular healing. ‘I’m sorry.’ She wasn’t listening. She had her own things to say. ‘I don’t even know you. I have no idea of who you are. No idea. If you’ve done this, you really are an alien to me . . .’ ‘Am I? Listen, Isobel, you’re right. I am. I am not from here. I have never loved before. All this is new. I’m an amateur at this. Listen, I used to be immortal, I could not die, I could not feel pain, but I gave that up . . .’ She wasn’t even listening. She was a galaxy away. ‘All I know, all I know beyond any doubt, is that I want a divorce. I do. That is what I want. You have destroyed us. You have destroyed Gulliver. Again.’ Newton appeared at this point, wagging his tail to try and calm the mood. Isobel ignored Newton and started to walk away from me. I should have let her go, but bizarrely I couldn’t. I held on to her wrist. ‘Stay,’ I said. And then it happened. Her arm swung at me with ferocious force, her clenched hand an asteroid speeding towards the planet of my face. Not a slap or a scratch this time but a smack. Was this where love ended? With an injury on top of an injury on top of an injury? ‘I’m leaving the house now. And when I come back, I want you gone. Do you understand? Gone. I want you out of here, and out of our lives. It’s over. Everything. It’s all over. I thought you’d changed. I honestly thought you’d become someone else. And I let you in again! What a fucking idiot!’ I kept my hand over my face. It still hurt. I heard her footsteps head away I kept my hand over my face. It still hurt. I heard her footsteps head away from me. The door opened. The door closed. I was alone again with Newton. ‘I’ve really done it now,’ I said. He seemed to agree, but I couldn’t understand him any more. I might as well have been any human trying to understand any dog. But he seemed something other than sad, as he barked in the direction of the living room and the road beyond. It seemed less like condolence and more like warning. I went to look out of the living-room window. There was nothing to be seen. So I stroked Newton one more time, offered a pointless apology, and left the house. PART III The wounded deer leaps the highest It belongs to the perfection of everything human that man can only attain his desire by passing through its opposite. – Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling An encounter with Winston Churchill I walked to the nearest shop, a brightly lit and unsympathetic place called Tesco Metro. I bought myself a bottle of Australian wine. I walked along a cycle path and drank it, singing ‘God Only Knows’. It was quiet. I sat down by a tree and finished the bottle. I went and bought another. I sat down on a park bench, next to a man with a large beard. It was the man I had seen before. On my first day. The one who had called me Jesus. He was wearing the same long dirty raincoat and he had the same scent. This time I found it fascinating. I sat there for a while just working out all the different aromas – alcohol, sweat, tobacco, urine, infection. It was a uniquely human smell, and rather wonderful in its own sad way. ‘I don’t know why more people don’t do this,’ I said, striking up a conversation. ‘Do what?’ ‘You know, get drunk. Sit on a park bench. It seems like a good way to solve problems.’ ‘Are you taking the piss, fella?’ ‘No. I like it. And you obviously like it or you wouldn’t be doing it.’ Of course, this was a little bit disingenuous of me. Humans were always doing things they didn’t like doing. In fact, to my best estimate, at any one time only point three per cent of humans were actively doing something they liked doing, and even when they did so, they felt an intense amount of guilt about it and were fervently promising themselves they’d be back doing something horrendously unpleasant very shortly. A blue plastic bag floated by on the wind. The bearded man rolled a cigarette. He had shaky fingers. Nerve damage. ‘Ain’t no choice in love and life,’ he said. ‘No. That’s true. Even when you think there are choices there aren’t really. But I thought humans still subscribed to the illusion of free will?’ ‘Not me, chief.’ And then he started singing, in a mumbled baritone of very low frequency. ‘Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone . . .’ low frequency. ‘Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone . . .’ ‘What’s your name?’ ‘I’m Andrew,’ I said. ‘Sort of.’ ‘What’s bothering you? You got beat up? Your face looks like shit.’ ‘Yeah, in lots of ways. I had someone love me. And it was the most precious thing, that love. It gave me a family. It made me feel like I belonged. And I broke it.’ He lit the cigarette, which flopped out of his face like a numb antennae. ‘Ten years me and my wife were married,’ he said. ‘Then I lost my job and she left me the same week. That’s when I turned to drink and my leg started to turn on me.’ He lifted up his trousers. His left leg was swollen and purple. And violet. I could see he expected me to be disgusted. ‘Deep vein thrombosis. Effing agony, it is. Effing fucking agony. And it’s gonna bloody kill me one of these days.’ He passed me the cigarette. I inhaled. I knew I didn’t like it, but I still inhaled. ‘What’s your name?’ I asked him. He laughed. ‘Winston bloody Churchill.’ ‘Oh, like the wartime prime minister.’ I watched him close his eyes and suck on his cigarette. ‘Why do people smoke?’ ‘No idea. Ask me something else.’ ‘Okay, then. How do you cope with loving someone who hates you? Someone who doesn’t want to see you again.’ ‘God knows.’ He winced. He was in agony. I had noticed his pain on the first day, but now I wanted to do something about it. I had drunk enough to believe I could, or at least to forget I couldn’t. He was about to roll his trousers down, but seeing the pain he was in, I told him to wait a moment. I placed my hand on the leg. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Don’t worry. It’s a very simple procedure of bio-set transference, involving reverse-apoptosis, working at the molecular level to restore and recreate dead and diseased cells. To you it will look like magic, but it isn’t.’ My hand stayed there and nothing happened. And nothing kept on happening. It looked very far from magic. ‘Who are you?’ ‘I’m an alien. I’m considered a useless failure in two galaxies.’ ‘Well, could you please take your damn hand off my leg?’ I took my hand away. ‘Sorry. Really. I thought I still had the ability to heal you.’ ‘I know you,’ he said. ‘I know you,’ he said. ‘What?’ ‘I’ve seen you before.’ ‘Yes. I know. I passed you, on my first day in Cambridge. You may remember. I was naked.’ He leant back, squinted, angled his head. ‘Nah. Nah. Wasn’t that. I saw you today.’ ‘I don’t think you did. I’m pretty sure I would have recognised you.’ ‘Nah. Definitely today. I’m good with faces, see.’ ‘Was I with someone? A young woman? Red hair?’ He considered. ‘Nah. It was just you.’ ‘Where was I?’ ‘Oh, you were on, let me think, you’d have been on Newmarket Road.’ ‘Newmarket Road?’ I knew the name of the street, because it was where Ari lived, but I hadn’t ever been on the street myself. Not today. Not ever. Though of course, it was very likely that Andrew Martin – the original Andrew Martin – had been down there many times. Yes, that must have been it. He was getting mixed up. ‘I think you might be confused.’ He shook his head. ‘It was you all right. This morning. Maybe midday. No word of a lie.’ And with that the man stood up and hobbled slowly away from me, leaving a trail of smoke and spilt alcohol. A cloud passed across the sun. I looked up to the sky. I had a thought as dark as the shade. I stood up. I took the phone out of my pocket and called Ari. Eventually someone picked up. It was a woman. She was breathing heavily, sniffing up snot, struggling to turn noise into coherent words. ‘Hello, this is Andrew. I wondered if Ari was there.’ And then the words came, in morbid succession: ‘He’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead.’ The replacement I ran. I left the wine and I ran as fast as I could, across the park, along streets, over main roads, hardly thinking about traffic. It hurt, this running. It hurt my knees, my hips, my heart and my lungs. All those components, reminding me they would one day fail. It also, somehow, aggravated the various facial aches and pains I was suffering. But, mostly, it was my mind that was in turmoil. This was my fault. This had nothing to do with the Riemann hypothesis and everything to do with the fact that I had told Ari the truth about where I was from. He hadn’t believed me, but that hadn’t been the point. I had been able to tell him, without getting an agonising violet-tainted warning. They had disconnected me, but they must still have been watching, and listening, which meant they could probably hear me now. ‘Don’t do it. Don’t hurt Isobel or Gulliver. They don’t know anything.’ I reached the house that, up until this morning, I had been living in with the people I had grown to love. I crunched my way up the gravel driveway. The car wasn’t there. I looked through the living-room window, but there was no sign of anyone. I had no key with me so I rang the doorbell. I stood and waited, wondering what I could do. After a while, the door opened, but I still couldn’t see anyone. Whoever had opened the door clearly didn’t want to be seen. I stepped into the house. I walked past the kitchen. Newton was asleep in his basket. I went over to him, shook him gently. ‘Newton! Newton!’ But he stayed asleep, breathing deeply, mysteriously unwakeable. ‘I’m in here,’ said a voice, coming from the living room. So I followed it, that familiar voice, until I was there, looking at a man sitting on the purple sofa with one leg crossed over the other. He was instantly familiar to me – indeed, he could not have been more so – and yet, at the same time, the sight of him was terrifying. For it was myself I was looking at. His clothes were different (jeans instead of cords, a T-shirt instead of shirt, His clothes were different (jeans instead of cords, a T-shirt instead of shirt, trainers in place of shoes) but it was definitely the form of Andrew Martin. The mid-brown hair, naturally parted. The tired eyes, and the same face except for the absence of bruises. ‘Snap!’ he said, smiling. ‘That is what they say here, isn’t it? You know, when they are playing card games. Snap! We are identical twins.’ ‘Who are you?’ He frowned, as if I’d asked such a basic question it shouldn’t have been asked. ‘I’m your replacement.’ ‘My replacement?’ ‘That is what I said. I am here to do what you were unable to do.’ My heart was racing. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘To destroy information.’ Fear and anger were sometimes the same thing. ‘You killed Ari?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Why? He didn’t know the Riemann hypothesis had been proved.’ ‘No. I know. I have been given broader instructions than you. I have been told to destroy anyone you have told about your’ – he considered the right word – ‘origins.’ ‘So they’ve been listening to me? They said I was disconnected.’ He pointed at my left hand, where the technology still evidently lived. ‘They took your powers away, but they didn’t take theirs. They listen sometimes. They check.’ I stared at it. At my hand. It looked, suddenly, like an enemy. ‘How long have you been here? On Earth, I mean.’ ‘Not long.’ ‘Someone broke into this house a few nights ago. They accessed Isobel’s computer.’ ‘That was me.’ ‘So why the delay? Why didn’t you finish the job that night?’ ‘You were here. I did not want to hurt you. No Vonnadorian has killed another Vonnadorian. Not directly.’ ‘Well, I’m not really a Vonnadorian. I am a human. The paradox is that I’m light years from home, and yet this feels like my home. That is a strange thing to feel. So, what have you been doing? Where have you been living?’ He hesitated, swallowed hard. ‘I have been living with a female.’ ‘A female human? A woman?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Where?’ ‘Outside Cambridge. A village. She doesn’t know my name. She thinks I am ‘Outside Cambridge. A village. She doesn’t know my name. She thinks I am called Jonathan Roper. I convinced her we were married.’ I laughed. The laugh seemed to surprise him. ‘Why are you laughing?’ ‘I don’t know. I have gained a sense of humour. That is one thing that happened when I lost the gifts.’ ‘I am going to kill them, do you know that?’ ‘No. Actually, I don’t. I told the hosts there is no point. That’s about the last thing I said to them. They seemed to understand me.’ ‘I have been told to, and that is what I will do.’ ‘But don’t you think it’s pointless, that there’s no real reason to do it?’ He sighed and shook his head. ‘No, I do not think that’, he said, in a voice which was mine but deeper, somehow, and flatter. ‘I do not see a separation. I have lived with a human for only a few days but I have seen the violence and hypocrisy that runs through this species.’ ‘Yes, but there is good in them. A lot of good.’ ‘No. I don’t see it. They can sit and watch dead human bodies on TV screens and feel nothing at all.’ ‘That’s how I saw it at first, but—’ ‘They can drive a car thirty miles every day and feel good about themselves for recycling a couple of empty jam jars. They can talk about peace being a good thing yet glorify war. They can despise the man who kills his wife in rage but worship the indifferent soldier who drops a bomb killing a hundred children.’ ‘Yes, there is a bad logic here, I agree with you, yet I truly believe—’ He wasn’t listening. He stood up now, stared at me with determined eyes as he paced the room and delivered his speech. ‘They believe God is always on their side, even if their side is at odds with the rest of their species. They have no way of coming to terms with what are, biologically, the two most important events that happen to them – procreation and death. They pretend to know that money can’t buy them happiness, yet they would choose money every time. They celebrate mediocrity at every available opportunity and love to see others’ misfortune. They have lived on this planet for over a hundred thousand generations and yet they still have no idea about who they really are or how they should really live. In fact, they know less now than they once did.’ ‘You’re right but don’t you think there is something beautiful in these contradictions, something mysterious?’ ‘No. No, I do not. What I think is that their violent will has helped them dominate the world, and “civilise” it, but now there is nowhere left for them to go, and so the human world has turned in on itself. It is a monster that feasts on its own hands. And still they do not see the monster, or if they do they do not see that they are inside it, molecules within the beast.’ that they are inside it, molecules within the beast.’ I looked at the bookshelves. ‘Have you read human poetry? Humans understand these failings.’ He still wasn’t listening. ‘They have lost themselves but not their ambitions. Do not think that they would not leave this place if they had the chance. They’re beginning to realise life is out there, that we or beings like us, are out there, and they won’t just stop at that. They will want to explore, and as their mathematical understanding expands, then they will eventually be able to do so. They will find us, eventually, and when they do, they will not want to be friends, even if they think – as they always do – that their own ends are perfectly benevolent. They will find a reason to destroy or subjugate other life forms.’ A girl in a school uniform walked past the house. Pretty soon, Gulliver would be coming home. ‘But there is no connection between killing these people and stopping progress, I promise you. No connection.’ He stopped pacing the room and came over to me, leant into my face. ‘Connections? I will tell you about connections . . . An amateur German physicist works in a patent office in Bern in Switzerland. He comes up with a theory that, half a century later, will lead to whole Japanese cities being destroyed, along with much of their population. Husbands, wives, sons, daughters. He does not want that connection to form, but that does not stop it forming.’ ‘You’re talking about something very different.’ ‘No. No, I am not. This is a planet where a daydream can end in death, and where mathematicians can cause an apocalypse. That is my view of the humans. Is it any different from yours?’ ‘Humans learn the errors of their ways though,’ I said, ‘and they care more for each other than you think.’ ‘No. I know they care for each other when the other in question is like them, or lives under their roof, but any difference is a step further away from their empathy. They find it preposterously easy to fall out among themselves. Imagine what they would do to us, if they could.’ Of course, I had already imagined this and was scared of the answer. I was weakening. I felt tired and confused. ‘But we were sent here to kill them. What makes us any better?’ ‘We act as a result of logic, of rational thinking. We are here to preserve, even to preserve the humans. Think about it. Progress is a very dangerous thing for them. The boy must be killed, even if the woman can be saved. The boy knows. You told us yourself.’ You told us yourself.’ ‘You are making a little mistake.’ ‘What is my mistake?’ ‘You cannot kill a mother’s son without killing the mother.’ ‘You are speaking in riddles. You have become like them.’ I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. Gulliver would return home at any moment. I tried to think what to do. Maybe this other me, this ‘Jonathan’ was right. Well, there wasn’t really a maybe. He was right: the humans could not handle progress very well and they were not good at understanding their place in the world. They were, ultimately, a great danger to themselves and others. So I nodded, and I walked over and sat on that purple sofa. I felt sober now, and fully conscious of my pain. ‘You are right,’ I said. ‘You are right. And I want to help you.’ A game ‘I know you are right,’ I told him for the seventeenth time, looking straight into his eyes, ‘but I have been weak. I admit it to you now. I was and remain unable to harm any more humans, especially those ones I have lived with. But what you have said to me has reminded me of my original purpose. I am not able to fulfil that purpose and no longer have the gifts to do so, but equally I realise it has to be fulfilled, and so in a way I’m thankful you are here. I’ve been stupid. I’ve tried and I have failed.’ Jonathan sat back on the sofa and studied me. He stared at my bruises and sniffed the air between us. ‘You have been drinking alcohol.’ ‘Yes. I have been corrupted. It is very easy, I find, when you live like a human, to develop some of their bad habits. I have drunk alcohol. I have had sex. I have smoked cigarettes. I have eaten peanut butter sandwiches and listened to their simple music. I have felt many of the crude pleasures that they can feel, as well as physical and emotional pain. But still, despite my corruption, there remains enough of me left, enough of my clear rational self, to know what has to be done.’ He watched me. He believed me, because every word I was speaking was the truth. ‘I am comforted to hear this.’ I didn’t waste a moment. ‘Now listen to me. Gulliver will return home soon. He won’t be on a car or a bike. He’ll be walking. He likes to walk. We will hear his feet on the gravel, and then we will hear his key in the door. Normally, he heads straight into the kitchen to get himself a drink or a bowl of cereal. He eats around three bowls of cereal a day. Anyway, that is irrelevant. What is relevant is that he will most likely enter the kitchen first.’ Jonathan was paying close attention to everything I was telling him. It felt strange, terrible even, giving him this information, but I really couldn’t think of any other way. ‘You want to act fast,’ I said, ‘as his mother will be home soon. Also, there’s a chance he may be surprised to see you. You see, his mother has thrown me out of the house because I was unfaithful to her. Or rather the faith I had wasn’t the of the house because I was unfaithful to her. Or rather the faith I had wasn’t the right kind. Given the absence of mind-reading technology, humans believe monogamy is possible. Another fact to consider is that Gulliver has, quite independently, attempted to take his own life before. So, I suggest that however you choose to kill him it would be a good idea to make it look like suicide. Maybe after his heart has stopped, you could slice one of his wrists, cutting through the veins. That way, less suspicion will be aroused.’ Jonathan nodded, then looked around the room. At the television, the history books, the armchair, the framed art prints on the wall, the telephone in its cradle. ‘It will be a good idea to have the television on,’ I told him, ‘even if you are not in this room. Because I always watch the news and leave it on.’ He switched on the television. We sat and watched footage of war in the Middle East, without saying a word. But then he heard something that I couldn’t, his senses being so much sharper. ‘Footsteps,’ he said. ‘On the gravel.’ ‘He’s here,’ I said. ‘Go to the kitchen. I’ll hide.’ 90.2 MHz I waited in the sitting room. The door was closed. There would be no reason for Gulliver to enter here. Unlike the living room he hardly ever came into this room. I don’t think I’d ever heard him do so. So I stayed there, still and quiet, as the front door opened, then closed. He was unmoving, in the hallway. No footsteps. ‘Hello?’ Then a response. My voice but not my voice, coming from the kitchen. ‘Hello, Gulliver.’ ‘What are you doing here? Mum said you’d gone. She phoned me, said you’d had an argument.’ I heard him – me, Andrew, Jonathan – respond in measured words. ‘That is right. We did. We had an argument. Don’t worry, it wasn’t too serious.’ ‘Oh yeah? Sounded pretty serious from Mum’s side of things.’ Gulliver paused. ‘Whose are those clothes you’re wearing?’ ‘Oh, these, they’re just old ones I didn’t know I had.’ ‘I’ve never seen them before. And your face, it’s totally healed. You look completely better.’ ‘Well, there you go.’ ‘Right, anyway, I might go upstairs. I’ll get some food later.’ ‘No. No. You will stay right here.’ The mind patterning was beginning. His words were shepherds ushering away conscious thought. ‘You will stay here and you will take a knife – a sharp knife, the sharpest there is in this room—’ It was about to happen. I could feel it, so I did what I had planned to do. I went over to the bookcase and picked up the clockwork radio, turned the power dial through a full 360-degree rotation and pressed the button with the little green circle. On. The small display became illuminated: 90.2 MHz. Classical music blared out at almost full volume as I carried the radio back along the hallway. Unless I was very much mistaken it was Debussy. along the hallway. Unless I was very much mistaken it was Debussy. ‘You will now press that knife into your wrist and press it hard enough to cut through every vein.’ ‘What’s that noise?’ Gulliver asked, his head clearing. I still couldn’t see him. I still wasn’t quite at the kitchen doorway. ‘Just do it. End your life, Gulliver.’ I entered the kitchen and saw my doppelgänger facing away from me as he pressed his hand on to Gulliver’s head. The knife fell to the floor. It was like looking at a strange kind of human baptism. I knew that what he was doing was right, and logical, from his perspective, but perspective was a funny thing. Gulliver collapsed; his whole body was convulsing. I placed the radio down on the unit. The kitchen had its own radio. I switched that on, too. The TV was still on in the other room, as I had intended it to be. A cacophony of classical music and newsreaders and rock music filled the air as I reached Jonathan and pulled his arm so he now had no contact with Gulliver. He turned, held me by the throat, pressing me back against the refrigerator. ‘You have made a mistake,’ he said. Gulliver’s convulsions stopped and he looked around, confused. He saw two men, both identical, like his father, pressing into each other’s necks with equivalent force. I knew that, whatever else happened, I had to keep Jonathan in the kitchen. If he stayed in the kitchen, with the radios on and the TV in the next room, we would be equally matched. ‘Gulliver,’ I said. ‘Gulliver, give me the knife. Any knife. That knife. Give me that knife.’ ‘Dad? Are you my Dad?’ ‘Yes, I am. Now give me the knife.’ ‘Ignore him, Gulliver,’ Jonathan said. ‘He’s not your father. I am. He’s an imposter. He’s not what he looks like. He’s a monster. An alien. We have to destroy him.’ As we carried on, locked in our mutually futile combative pose, matching strength with strength, I saw Gulliver’s eyes fill with doubt. He looked at me. It was time for the truth. ‘I’m not your father. And neither is he. Your dad is dead, Gulliver. He died on Saturday, the seventeenth of April. He was taken by the . . .’ I thought of a way of putting it that he would understand. ‘. . . by the people we work for. They extracted information from him, and then they killed him. And they sent me here, as him, to kill you. And kill your mother. And anyone who knew about what he had achieved that day, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it because I what he had achieved that day, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it because I started, I started to feel something that was meant to be impossible . . . I empathised with you. Grew to like you. Worry about you. Love you both. And I gave everything up . . . I have no power, no strength.’ ‘Don’t listen to him, son,’ Jonathan said. And then he realised something. ‘Turn off the radios. Listen to me, turn off the radios now.’ I stared at Gulliver with pleading eyes. ‘Whatever you do, don’t turn them off. The signal interferes with the technology. It’s his left hand. His left hand. Everything is in his left hand . . .’ Gulliver was clambering upright. He looked numb. His face was unreadable. I thought hard. ‘The leaf!’ I yelled. ‘Gulliver, you were right. The leaf, remember, the leaf! And think of—’ It was then that the other version of myself smashed his head into my nose, with swift and brutal force. My head rebounded against the fridge door and everything dissolved. Colours faded, and the noise of the radios and the faraway newsreader swam into each other. A swirling audio soup. It was over. ‘Gulli—’ The other me switched one of the radios off. Debussy disappeared. But at the moment the music went away I heard a scream. It sounded like Gulliver. And it was, but it wasn’t a scream of pain. It was a scream of determination. A primal roar of rage, giving him the courage he needed to stab the knife that had been about to cut his own wrists into the back of a man who looked every inch his own father. And the knife went deep. With that roar, and that sight, the room sharpened into focus. I could get to my feet before Jonathan’s finger reached the second radio. I yanked him back by the hair. I saw his face. The pain clearly articulated in the way only human faces can manage. The eyes, shocked yet pleading. The mouth seeming to melt away. Melt away. Melt away. Melt away. The ultimate crime I would not look at his face again. He could not die while that technology remained inside him. I dragged him over to the Aga. ‘Lift it up,’ I ordered Gulliver. ‘Lift up the cover.’ ‘Cover?’ ‘The hot plate.’ He did it. He lifted the circular steel ring up and let it fall back, and he did so without a single question in his eyes. ‘Help me,’ I said. ‘He’s fighting. Help me with his arm.’ Together we had enough force to press his palm down to the burning metal. The scream, as we kept him there, was horrendous. Knowing what it was I was doing, it truly sounded like the end of the universe. I was committing the ultimate crime. I was destroying gifts, and killing one of my kind. ‘We’ve got to keep it there,’ I shouted to Gulliver. ‘We’ve got to keep it there! Hold! Hold! Hold!’ And then I switched my attention to Jonathan. ‘Tell them it is over,’ I whispered. ‘Tell them you have completed your mission. Tell them there has been a problem with the gifts and that you will not be able to return. Tell them, and I will stop the pain.’ A lie. And a gamble that they were tuned to him and not to me. But a necessary one. He told them, yet his pain continued. How long were we like this? Seconds? Minutes? It was like Einstein’s conundrum. The hot stove versus the pretty girl. Towards the end of it, Jonathan was on his knees, losing consciousness. Tears streamed down my face as I finally pulled that sticky mess of a hand away. I checked his pulse. He was gone. The knife pierced through his chest as he fell back. I looked at the hand, and this face, and it was clear. He was disconnected, not just from the hosts, but from life. The reason it was clear was that he was becoming himself – the cellular reconfiguration that automatically followed death. The whole shape of him was reconfiguration that automatically followed death. The whole shape of him was changing, curling in, his face flattening, his skull lengthening, his skin mottled shades of purple and violet. Only the knife in his back stayed. It was strange. Within the context of that Earth kitchen this creature, structured precisely as I had been, seemed entirely alien to me. A monster. A beast. Something other. Gulliver stared, but said nothing. The shock was so profound it was a challenge to breathe, let alone speak. I did not want to speak either, but for more practical reasons. Indeed, I worried that I may already have said too much. Maybe the hosts had heard everything I had said in that kitchen. I didn’t know. What I did know was that I had one more thing to do. They took your powers away, but they didn’t take theirs. But before I could do anything a car pulled up outside. Isobel was home. ‘Gulliver, it’s your mother. Keep her away. Warn her.’ He left the room. I turned back to the heat of that hot plate and positioned my hand next to where his had been, where pieces of his flesh still fizzed. And I pressed down, and felt a pure and total pain which took away space and time and guilt. The nature of reality Civilised life, you know, is based on a huge number of illusions in which we all collaborate willingly. The trouble is we forget after a while that they are illusions and we are deeply shocked when reality is torn down around us. – J.G. Ballard What was reality? An objective truth? A collective illusion? A majority opinion? The product of historical understanding? A dream? A dream. Well, yes, maybe. But if this had been a dream then it was one from which I hadn’t yet woken. But once humans really study things in depth – whether in the artificially divided fields of quantum physics or biology or neuroscience or mathematics or love – they come closer and closer to nonsense, irrationality and anarchy. Everything they know is disproved, over and over again. The Earth is not flat; leeches have no medicinal value; there is no God; progress is a myth; the present is all they have. And this doesn’t just happen on the big scale. It happens to each individual human too. In every life there is a moment. A crisis. One that says: what I believe is wrong. It happens to everyone, the only difference is how that knowledge changes them. In most cases, it is simply a case of burying that knowledge and pretending it isn’t there. That is how humans grow old. That is ultimately what creases their faces and curves their backs and shrinks their mouths and ambitions. The weight of that denial. The stress of it. This is not unique to humans. The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change. I was something. And now I am something else. I was a monster and now I am a different type of monster. One that will die, and feel pain, but one that will also live, and maybe even find happiness one day. Because happiness is possible for me now. It exists on the other side of the hurt. A face as shocked as the moon As for Gulliver, he was young, and could accept things better than his mother. His life had never really made sense to him so the final proof of its nonsensical nature was a kind of relief to him. He was someone who had lost a father and also someone who had killed, but the thing he had killed was something he didn’t understand and couldn’t relate to. He could have cried for a dead dog, but a dead Vonnadorian meant nothing to him. On the subject of grief, it was true that Gulliver was worried about his father, and wanted to know that he hadn’t felt any pain. I told him he hadn’t. Was that true? I didn’t know. That was part of being human, I discovered. It was about knowing which lies to tell, and when to tell them. To love someone is to lie to them. But I never saw him cry for his dad. I didn’t know why. Maybe it was hard to feel the loss of someone who had never really been there. Anyway, after dark he helped drag the body outside. Newton was awake now. He had woken after Jonathan’s technology had melted away. And now he accepted what he was seeing as dogs seemed to accept everything. There were no canine historians, so that made things easier. Nothing was unexpected. At one point he began digging in the ground, as if trying to help us, but that wasn’t required. No grave needed to be dug as the monster – and that was how I referred to it in my mind, the monster – would in its natural state decompose rapidly in this oxygen-rich atmosphere. It was quite a struggle, dragging him out there, especially given my burnt hand and the fact that Gulliver had to stop to be sick at one point. He looked dreadful. I remember watching him, staring at me from beneath his fringe, his face as shocked as the moon. Newton wasn’t our only observer. Isobel watched us in disbelief. I hadn’t wanted her to come outside and see but she did so. At that point she didn’t know everything. She didn’t know, for instance, that her husband was dead or that the corpse I was dragging looked, essentially, how I had once looked. She learnt these things slowly, but not slowly enough. She would have needed at least a couple of centuries to absorb these facts, maybe even more. It was like at least a couple of centuries to absorb these facts, maybe even more. It was like taking someone from Regency England to twenty-first century downtown Tokyo. She simply could not come to terms with it. After all, she was a historian. Someone whose job was to find patterns, continuities and causes, and to transform the past into a narrative that walked the same curving path. But on this path someone had now thrown something down from the sky that had landed so hard it had broken the ground, tilted the Earth, made the route impossible to navigate. Which is to say, she went to the doctor and asked for some tablets. The pills she was given didn’t help and she ended up staying in bed for three weeks through exhaustion. It was suggested that she might have an illness called ME. She didn’t, of course. She was suffering from grief. A grief for not just the loss of her husband but also the loss of familiar reality. She hated me, during that time. I had explained everything to her: that none of this had been my decision, that I had been sent here reluctantly with no task except to halt human progress and to act for the greater good of the entire cosmos. But she couldn’t look at me because she didn’t know what she was looking at. I had lied to her. I’d slept with her. I’d let her tend my wounds. But she hadn’t known who she had been sleeping with. It didn’t matter that I had fallen in love with her, and that it was that act of total defiance that had saved her life and Gulliver’s. No. That didn’t matter at all. I was a killer and, to her, an alien. My hand slowly healed. I went to the hospital and they gave me a transparent plastic glove to wear, filled with an antiseptic cream. At the hospital they asked me how it had happened and I told them I had been drunk and leant on the hot plate without thinking, and without feeling the pain until it was too late. The burns became blisters and the nurse burst them, and I watched with interest as clear liquid oozed out. Selfishly I had hoped at some point that my injured hand might trigger some sympathy from Isobel. I wanted to see those eyes again. Eyes that had gazed worriedly at my face after Gulliver had attacked me in his sleep. I briefly toyed with the idea that I should try and convince her that nothing I had told her was true. That we were more magic realism than science fiction, specifically that branch of literary fiction that comes complete with an unreliable narrator. That I wasn’t really an alien. That I was a human who’d had a breakdown, and there was nothing extraterrestrial or extramarital about me. Gulliver might have known what he had seen, but Gulliver had a fragile mind. I could easily have denied everything. A dog’s health fluctuates. People fall off roofs and survive. After all, humans – especially adult ones – want to believe the most mundane truths possible. They need to, in order to stop their world-views, most mundane truths possible. They need to, in order to stop their world-views, and their sanity, from capsizing and plunging them into the vast ocean of the incomprehensible. But it seemed too disrespectful, somehow, and I couldn’t do it. Lies were everywhere on this planet, but true love had its name for a reason. And if a narrator tells you it was all just a dream you want to tell him he has simply passed from one delusion into another one, and he could wake from this new reality at any time. You had to stay consistent to life’s delusions. All you had was your perspective, so objective truth was meaningless. You had to choose a dream and stick with it. Everything else was a con. And once you had tasted truth and love in the same potent cocktail there had to be no more tricks. But while I knew I couldn’t correct this version of things with any integrity, living with it was hard. You see, before coming to Earth I had never wanted or needed to be cared for, but I hungered now to have that feeling of being looked after, of belonging, of being loved. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe it was more than I deserved to be allowed to stay in the same house, even if I had to sleep on that hideous purple sofa. The only reason this was granted, I imagined, was Gulliver. Gulliver wanted me to stay. I had saved his life. I had helped him stand up to bullies. But his forgiveness still came as a surprise. Don’t get me wrong. It wasn’t Cinema Paradiso, but he seemed to accept me as an extraterrestrial life form far more easily than he had accepted me as a father. ‘Where are you from?’ he asked me, one Saturday morning, at five minutes to seven, before his mother was awake. ‘Far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far away.’ ‘How far is far?’ ‘It’s very hard to explain,’ I said. ‘I mean, you think France is far away.’ ‘Just try,’ he said. I noticed the fruit bowl. Only the day before, I had been to the supermarket buying healthy food the doctor had recommended for Isobel. Bananas, oranges, grapes, a grapefruit. ‘Okay,’ I said, grabbing the large grapefruit. ‘This is the sun.’ I placed the grapefruit on the coffee table. I then looked for the smallest grape I could find. I placed it at the other end of the table. ‘That is Earth, so small you can hardly see it.’ Newton stepped closer to the table, clearly attempting to annihilate Earth in his jaws. ‘No, Newton,’ I said. ‘Let me finish.’ his jaws. ‘No, Newton,’ I said. ‘Let me finish.’ Newton retreated, tail between his legs. Gulliver was frowning as he studied the grapefruit and the fragile little grape. He looked around. ‘So where is your planet?’ I think he honestly expected me to place the orange I was holding somewhere else in the room. By the television or on one of the bookshelves. Or maybe, at a pinch, upstairs. ‘To be accurate, this orange should be placed on a coffee table in New Zealand.’ He was silent for a moment, trying to understand the level of far-ness I was talking about. Still in a trance he asked, ‘Can I go there?’ ‘No. It’s impossible.’ ‘Why? There must have been a spaceship.’ I shook my head. ‘No. I didn’t travel. I may have arrived, but I didn’t travel.’ He was confused, so I explained, but then he was even more confused. ‘Anyway, the point is, there is no more chance of me crossing the universe now than any other human. This is who I am now, and this is where I have to stay.’ ‘You gave up the universe for a life on the sofa?’ ‘I didn’t realise that at the time.’ Isobel came downstairs. She was wearing her white dressing gown and her pyjamas. She was pale, but she was always pale in the morning. She looked at me and Gulliver talking, and for a moment, she seemed to greet the scene with a rarely seen fondness. But the expression faded as she remembered everything. ‘What’s going on?’ she asked. ‘Nothing,’ said Gulliver. ‘What is the fruit doing?’ she asked, traces of sleep still evident in her quiet voice. ‘I was explaining to Gulliver where I came from. How far away.’ ‘You came from a grapefruit?’ ‘No. The grapefruit is the sun. Your sun. Our sun. I lived on the orange. Which should be in New Zealand. Earth is now in Newton’s stomach.’ I smiled at her. I thought she might find this funny, but she just stared at me the way she had been staring at me for weeks. As if I were light years away from her. She left the room. ‘Gulliver,’ I said, ‘I think it would be best if I left. I shouldn’t have stayed, really. You see, this isn’t just about all this stuff. You know that argument me and your mother had? The one you never found out about?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Well, I was unfaithful. I had sex with a woman called Maggie. One of my – your father’s – students. I didn’t enjoy it, but that was beside the point. I didn’t realise it would hurt your mother, but it did. I didn’t know the exact rules of fidelity but that isn’t really an excuse, or not one I can use, when I was deliberately lying about so many other things. When I was endangering her life, and yours.’ I sighed. ‘I think, I think I’m going to leave.’ ‘Why?’ That question tugged at me. It reached into my stomach, and pulled. ‘I just think it will be for the best, right now.’ ‘Where are you going to go?’ ‘I don’t know. Not yet. But don’t worry, I’ll tell you when I get there.’ His mother was back in the doorway. ‘I’m going to leave,’ I told her. She closed her eyes. She inhaled. ‘Yes,’ she said, with the mouth I had once kissed. ‘Yes. Maybe it is for the best.’ Her whole face crumpled, as if her skin were the emotion she wanted to screw up and throw away. My eyes felt a warm, gentle strain. My vision blurred. Then something ran down my cheek, all the way to my lips. A liquid. Like rain, but warmer. Saline. I had shed a tear. The second type of gravity Before I left I went upstairs to the attic. It was dark in there, except for the glow of the computer. Gulliver was lying on his bed, staring out of the window. ‘I’m not your dad, Gulliver. I don’t have a right to be here.’ ‘No. I know.’ Gulliver chewed on his wristband. Hostility glistened in his eyes like broken glass. ‘You’re not my dad. But you’re just like him. You don’t give a shit. And you shagged someone behind Mum’s back. He did that too, you know.’ ‘Listen, Gulliver, I’m not trying to leave you, I’m trying to bring back your mother, okay? She’s a bit lost right now and my presence here isn’t helping.’ ‘It’s just so fucked up. I feel totally alone.’ Sun suddenly shone through the window, oblivious to our mood. ‘Loneliness, Gulliver, is a fact as universal as hydrogen.’ He sighed a sigh that should really have belonged to an older human. ‘I just don’t feel cut out sometimes. You know, cut out for life. I mean, people at school, loads of their parents are divorced but they seem to have an okay relationship with their dads. And everyone’s always thought, with me, what excuse did I have to go off the rails? What was wrong with my life? Living in a nice house with rich non-divorced parents. What the fuck could possibly be wrong there? ‘But it was all bullshit. Mum and Dad never loved each other, not since I can remember anyway. Mum seemed to change after he had his breakdown – I mean, after you came – but that was just her delusion. I mean, you weren’t even who she thought you were. It’s come to something when you relate to ET more than your own dad. He was crap. Seriously, I can’t think of one piece of advice he gave me. Except I shouldn’t become an architect because architecture takes a hundred years to be appreciated.’ ‘Listen, you don’t need guidance, Gulliver. Everything you need is inside your own head. You have more knowledge about the universe than anyone on your own planet.’ I pointed at the window. ‘You’ve seen what’s out there. And also, I should say, you’ve shown yourself to be really strong.’ should say, you’ve shown yourself to be really strong.’ He stared out of the window again. ‘What’s it like up there?’ ‘Very different. Everything is different.’ ‘But how?’ ‘Well, just existing is different. No one dies. There’s no pain. Everything is beautiful. The only religion is mathematics. There are no families. There are the hosts – they give instructions – and there is everyone else. The advancement of mathematics and the security of the universe are the two concerns. There is no hatred. There are no fathers and sons. There is no clear line between biology and technology. And everything is violet.’ ‘It sounds awesome.’ ‘It’s dull. It’s the dullest life you can imagine. Here, you have pain, and loss, that’s the price. But the rewards can be wonderful Gulliver.’ He looked at me, disbelieving. ‘Yeah. Well, I don’t have a clue how to find them.’ The phone rang. Isobel answered. Moments later, she was calling up to the attic. ‘Gulliver, it’s for you. A girl. Nat.’ I couldn’t help but notice the faintest of faint smiles on Gulliver’s face, a smile he felt embarrassed about and tried to hide under clouds of discontent as he left the room. I sat and breathed, with lungs that would one day stop functioning but which still had a lot of warm clear air to inhale. Then I turned to Gulliver’s primitive Earth computer and began to type, giving as much advice as I could think of to help a human. Advice for a human 1. Shame is a shackle. Free yourself. 2. Don’t worry about your abilities. You have the ability to love. That is enough. 3. Be nice to other people. At the universal level, they are you. 4. Technology won’t save humankind. Humans will. 5. Laugh. It suits you. 6. Be curious. Question everything. A present fact is just a future fiction. 7. Irony is fine, but not as fine as feeling. 8. Peanut butter sandwiches go perfectly well with a glass of white wine. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 9. Sometimes, to be yourself you will have to forget yourself and become something else. Your character is not a fixed thing. You will sometimes have to move to keep up with it. 10. History is a branch of mathematics. So is literature. Economics is a branch of religion. 11. Sex can damage love but love can’t damage sex. 12. The news should start with mathematics, then poetry, and move down from there. 13. You shouldn’t have been born. Your existence is as close to impossible as can be. To dismiss the impossible is to dismiss yourself. 14. Your life will have 25,000 days in it. Make sure you remember some of them. 15. The road to snobbery is the road to misery. And vice versa. 16. Tragedy is just comedy that hasn’t come to fruition. One day we will laugh at this. We will laugh at everything. 17. Wear clothes, by all means, but remember they are clothes. 18. One life form’s gold is another life form’s tin can. 19. Read poetry. Especially poetry by Emily Dickinson. It might save you. Anne Sexton knows the mind, Walt Whitman knows grass, but Emily Dickinson knows everything. 20. If you become an architect, remember this: the square is nice. So is the 20. If you become an architect, remember this: the square is nice. So is the rectangle. But you can overdo it. 21. Don’t bother going into space until you can leave the solar system. Then go to Zabii. 22. Don’t worry about being angry. Worry when being angry becomes impossible. Because then you have been consumed. 23. Happiness is not out here. It is in there. 24. New technology, on Earth, just means something you will laugh at in five years. Value the stuff you won’t laugh at in five years. Like love. Or a good poem. Or a song. Or the sky. 25. There is only one genre in fiction. The genre is called ‘book’. 26. Never be too far away from a radio. A radio can save your life. 27. Dogs are geniuses of loyalty. And that is a good kind of genius to have. 28. Your mother should write a novel. Encourage her. 29. If there is a sunset, stop and look at it. Knowledge is finite. Wonder is infinite. 30. Don’t aim for perfection. Evolution, and life, only happen through mistakes. 31. Failure is a trick of the light. 32. You are human. You will care about money. But realise it can’t make you happy because happiness is not for sale. 33. You are not the most intelligent creature in the universe. You are not even the most intelligent creature on your planet. The tonal language in the song of a humpback whale displays more complexity than the entire works of Shakespeare. It is not a competition. Well, it is. But don’t worry about it. 34. David Bowie’s ‘Space Oddity’ tells you nothing about space, but its musical patterns are very pleasing to the ears. 35. When you look up at the sky, on a clear night, and see thousands of stars and planets, realise that very little is happening on most of them. The important stuff is further away. 36. One day humans will live on Mars. But nothing there will be more exciting than a single overcast morning on Earth. 37. Don’t always try to be cool. The whole universe is cool. It’s the warm bits that matter. 38. Walt Whitman was right about at least one thing. You will contradict yourself. You are large. You contain multitudes. 39. No one is ever completely right about anything. Anywhere. 40. Everyone is a comedy. If people are laughing at you they just don’t quite understand the joke that is themselves. 41. Your brain is open. Never let it be closed. 42. In a thousand years, if humans survive that long, everything you know will 42. In a thousand years, if humans survive that long, everything you know will have been disproved. And replaced by even bigger myths. 43. Everything matters. 44. You have the power to stop time. You do it by kissing. Or listening to music. Music, by the way, is how you see things you can’t otherwise see. It is the most advanced thing you have. It is a superpower. Keep up with the bass guitar. You are good at it. Join a band. 45. My friend Ari was one of the wisest humans who ever lived. Read him. 46. A paradox. The things you don’t need to live – books, art, cinema, wine and so on – are the things you need to live. 47. A cow is a cow even if you call it beef. 48. No two moralities match. Accept different shapes, so long as they aren’t sharp enough to hurt. 49. Don’t be scared of anyone. You killed an alien assassin sent from the other side of the universe with a bread knife. Also, you have a very hard punch. 50. At some point, bad things are going to happen. Have someone to hold on to. 51. Alcohol in the evening is very enjoyable. Hangovers in the morning are very unpleasant. At some point you have to choose: evenings, or mornings. 52. If you are laughing, check that you don’t really want to cry. And vice versa. 53. Don’t ever be afraid of telling someone you love them. There are things wrong with your world, but an excess of love is not one. 54. That girl you are on the phone to. There will be others. But I hope she is nice. 55. You are not the only species on Earth with technology. Look at ants. Really. Look. What they do with twigs and leaves is quite amazing. 56. Your mother loved your father. Even if she pretends she didn’t. 57. There are a lot of idiots in your species. Lots and lots. You are not one of them. Hold your ground. 58. It is not the length of life that matters. It’s the depth. But while burrowing, keep the sun above you. 59. Numbers are pretty. Prime numbers are beautiful. Understand that. 60. Obey your head. Obey your heart. Obey your gut. In fact, obey everything except commands. 61. One day, if you get into a position of power, tell people this: just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should. There is a power and a beauty in unproved conjectures, unkissed lips and unpicked flowers. 62. Start fires. But only metaphorically. Unless you are cold and it’s a safe setting. In which case: start fires. 63. It’s not the technique, it’s the method. It’s not the words, it’s the melody. 64. Be alive. That is your supreme duty to the world. 64. Be alive. That is your supreme duty to the world. 65. Don’t think you know. Know you think. 66. As a black hole forms it creates an immense gamma-ray burst, blinding whole galaxies with light and destroying millions of worlds. You could disappear at any second. This one. Or this one. Or this one. Make sure, as often as possible, you are doing something you’d be happy to die doing. 67. War is the answer. To the wrong question. 68. Physical attraction is, primarily, glandular. 69. Ari believed we are all a simulation. Matter is an illusion. Everything is silicon. He could be right. But your emotions? They’re solid. 70. It’s not you. It’s them. (No, really. It is.) 71. Walk Newton whenever you can. He likes to get out of the house. And he is a lovely dog. 72. Most humans don’t think about things very much. They survive by thinking about needs and wants alone. But you are not one of them. Be careful. 73. No one will understand you. It is not, ultimately, that important. What is important is that you understand you. 74. A quark is not the smallest thing. The wish you have on your death-bed – to have worked harder – that is the smallest thing. Because it won’t be there. 75. Politeness is often fear. Kindness is always courage. But caring is what makes you human. Care more, become more human. 76. In your mind, change the name of every day to Saturday. And change the name of work to play. 77. When you watch the news and see members of your species in turmoil, do not think there is nothing you can do. But know it is not done by watching news. 78. You get up. You put on your clothes. And then you put on your personality. Choose wisely. 79. Leonardo da Vinci was not one of you. He was one of us. 80. Language is euphemism. Love is truth. 81. You can’t find happiness looking for the meaning of life. Meaning is only the third most important thing. It comes after loving and being. 82. If you think something is ugly, look harder. Ugliness is just a failure of seeing. 83. A watched pot never boils. That is all you need to know about quantum physics. 84. You are more than the sum of your particles. And that is quite a sum. 85. The Dark Ages never ended. (But don’t tell your mother.) 86. To like something is to insult it. Love it or hate it. Be passionate. As civilisation advances, so does indifference. It is a disease. Immunise yourself civilisation advances, so does indifference. It is a disease. Immunise yourself with art. And love. 87. Dark matter is needed to hold galaxies together. Your mind is a galaxy. More dark than light. But the light makes it worthwhile. 88. Which is to say: don’t kill yourself. Even when the darkness is total. Always know that life is not still. Time is space. You are moving through that galaxy. Wait for the stars. 89. At the sub-atomic level, everything is complex. But you do not live at the sub-atomic level. You have the right to simplify. If you don’t, you will go insane. 90. But know this. Men are not from Mars. Women are not from Venus. Do not fall for categories. Everyone is everything. Every ingredient inside a star is inside you, and every personality that ever existed competes in the theatre of your mind for the main role. 91. You are lucky to be alive. Inhale and take in life’s wonders. Never take so much as a single petal of a single flower for granted. 92. If you have children and love one more than another, work at it. They will know, even if it’s by a single atom less. A single atom is all you need to make a very big explosion. 93. School is a joke. But go along with it, because you are very near to the punchline. 94. You don’t have to be an academic. You don’t have to be anything. Don’t force it. Feel your way, and don’t stop feeling your way until something fits. Maybe nothing will. Maybe you are a road, not a destination. That is fine. Be a road. But make sure it’s one with something to look at out of the window. 95. Be kind to your mother. And try and make her happy. 96. You are a good human, Gulliver Martin. 97. I love you. Remember that. A very brief hug I packed a bag full of Andrew Martin’s clothes and then I left. ‘Where are you going to go?’ asked Isobel. ‘I don’t know. I’ll find somewhere. Don’t worry.’ She looked like she was going to worry. We hugged. I longed to hear her hum the theme to Cinema Paradiso. I longed to hear her talk to me about Alfred the Great. I longed for her to make me a sandwich, or pour TCP on a swab of cotton wool. I longed to hear her share her worries about work, or Gulliver. But she wouldn’t. She couldn’t. The hug ended. Newton, by her side, looked up at me with the most forlorn eyes. ‘Goodbye,’ I said. And I walked across the gravel, towards the road and somewhere in the universe of my soul a fiery, life-giving star collapsed, and a very black hole began to form. The melancholy beauty of the setting sun Sometimes the hardest thing to do is just to stay human. – Michael Franti The thing with black holes, of course, is that they are really very neat and tidy. There is no mess inside a black hole. All the disordered stuff that goes through the event horizon, all that in-falling matter and radiation, is compressed to the smallest state it can possibly be. A state that might easily be called nothing at all. Black holes, in other words, give clarity. You lose the warmth and fire of the star but you gain order and peace. Total focus. That is to say, I knew what to do. I would stay as Andrew Martin. This was what Isobel wanted. You see, she wanted the least fuss possible. She didn’t want a scandal, or a missing person’s inquiry, or a funeral. So, doing what I thought was best, I moved out, rented a small flat in Cambridge for a while, and then I applied for jobs elsewhere in the world. Eventually, I got a teaching job in America, at Stanford University in California. Once there, I did as well as I needed to do while making sure I didn’t do anything to advance any mathematical understanding that would lead to a leap in technological progress. Indeed, I had a poster on my office wall with a photograph of Albert Einstein on it, and one of his famous statements: ‘Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological animal.’ I never mentioned anything about a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, except to persuade my peers of its inherent impossibility. My main motive for doing so was to make sure no Vonnadorian ever had need to visit Earth. But also, Einstein was right. Humans weren’t good at handling progress and I didn’t want to see more destruction than necessary inflicted on or by this planet. I lived on my own. I had a nice apartment in Palo Alto that I filled with plants. I got drunk, got high, got lower than low. I painted some art, ate peanut butter breakfasts, and once went to an arthouse cinema to watch three films by Fellini in a row. cinema to watch three films by Fellini in a row. I caught a cold, got tinnitus and consumed a poisoned prawn. I bought myself a globe, and I would often sit there, spinning it. I felt blue with sadness, red with rage and green with envy. I felt the entire human rainbow. I walked a dog for an elderly lady in the apartment above me, but the dog was never quite Newton. I talked over warm champagne at stifling academic functions. I shouted in forests just to hear the echo. And every night I would go back and re-read Emily Dickinson. I was lonely, but at the same time I appreciated other humans a bit more than they appreciated themselves. After all, I knew you could journey for light years and not come across a single one. On occasion, I would weep just looking at them, sitting in one of the vast libraries on campus. Sometimes I would wake up at three in the morning and find myself crying for no specific reason. At other times I would sit on my beanbag and stare into space, watching motes of dust suspended in sunlight. I tried not to make any friends. I knew that as friendships progressed questions would get more intrusive, and I didn’t want to lie to people. People would ask about my past, where I was from, my childhood. Sometimes a student or a fellow lecturer would look at my hand, at the scarred and purple skin, but they would never pry. It was a happy place, Stanford University. All the students wore smiles and red sweaters and looked very tanned and healthy for life forms who spent their entire days in front of computer screens. I would walk like a ghost through the bustle of the quad, breathing that warm air, trying not to be terrified by the scale of human ambition surrounding me. I got drunk a lot on white wine, which made me a rarity. No one seemed to have hangovers at this place. Also, I didn’t like frozen yoghurt – a big problem, as everyone at Stanford lived on frozen yoghurt. I bought myself music. Debussy, Ennio Morricone, the Beach Boys, Al Greene. I watched Cinema Paradiso. There was a Talking Heads song called ‘This Must Be the Place’ which I played over and over again, even though doing so made me feel melancholy and crave to hear her voice again, or to hear Gulliver’s footsteps on the stairs. I read a lot of poetry, too, though that often had a similar effect. One day I was in the campus bookstore and saw a copy of The Dark Ages by Isobel Martin. I stood there for what must have been the best part of half an hour reading her words aloud. ‘Freshly ravaged by the Vikings,’ I’d say, reading the penultimate page, ‘England was in a desperate state, and responded with a brutal massacre of Danish settlers in 1002. Over the next decade, this unrest was shown to breed even greater violence as the Danes embarked on a series of reprisals, culminating in Danish rule of England in 1013 . . .’ I pressed the page to my face, imagining it was her skin. I travelled with my work. I went to Paris, Boston, Rome, São Paolo, Berlin, Madrid, Tokyo. I wanted to fill my mind with human faces, in order to forget Isobel’s. But it had the opposite effect. By studying the entire human species, I felt more towards her specifically. By thinking of the cloud, I thirsted for the raindrop. So I stopped my travels and returned to Stanford, and tried a different tactic. I tried to lose myself in nature. The highlight of my day became the evening, when I would get in my car and drive out of town. Often I would head to the Santa Cruz mountains. There was a place there called the Big Basin Redwoods State Park. I would park my car and walk around, gazing in wonder at the giant trees, spotting jays and woodpeckers, chipmunks and racoons, occasionally a black-tailed deer. Sometimes, if I was early enough, I would walk down the steep path near Berry Creek Falls, listening to the rush of water which would often be joined by the low croak of tree frogs. At other times I would drive along Highway One and go to the beach to watch the sunset. Sunsets were beautiful here. I became quite hypnotised by them. In the past they had meant nothing to me. After all, a sunset was nothing really but the slowing down of light. At sunset light has more to get through, and is scattered by cloud droplets and air particles. But since becoming human I was just transfixed by the colours. Red, orange, pink. Sometimes there would be haunting traces of violet, too. I would sit on the beach, as waves crashed and retreated over the sparkling sand like lost dreams. All those oblivious molecules, joining together, creating something of improbable wonder. Often such sights were blurred by tears. I felt the beautiful melancholy of being human, captured perfectly in the setting of a sun. Because, as with a sunset, to be human was to be in-between things; a day, bursting with desperate colour as it headed irreversibly towards night. One night I stayed sitting on the beach as dusk fell. A fortysomething woman walked along, bare-footed, with a spaniel and her teenage son. Even though this woman looked quite different from Isobel, and though the son was blond, the sight caused my stomach to flip and my sinuses to loosen. I realised that six thousand miles could be an infinitely long distance. ‘I am such a human,’ I told my espadrilles. I meant it. Not only had I lost the gifts, emotionally I was as weak as any of them. I thought of Isobel, sitting and reading about Alfred the Great or them. I thought of Isobel, sitting and reading about Alfred the Great or Carolingian Europe or the ancient Library of Alexandria. This was, I realised, a beautiful planet. Maybe it was the most beautiful of all. But beauty creates its own troubles. You look at a waterfall or an ocean or a sunset and you find yourself wanting to share it with someone. ‘Beauty—be not caused—,’ said Emily Dickinson. ‘It is.’ In one way she was wrong. The scattering of light over a long distance creates a sunset. The crashing of ocean waves on a beach is created by tides which are themselves the result of gravitational forces exerted by the sun and the moon and the rotation of the Earth. Those are causes. The mystery lies in how those things become beautiful. And they wouldn’t have been beautiful once, at least not to my eyes. To experience beauty on Earth you needed to experience pain and to know mortality. That is why so much that is beautiful on this planet has to do with time passing and the Earth turning. Which might also explain why to look at such natural beauty was to also feel sadness and a craving for a life unlived. It was this particular kind of sadness that I felt, that evening. It came with its own gravitational pull, tugging me eastwards towards England. I told myself I just wanted to see them again, one last time. I just wanted to catch sight of them from a distance, to see with my own eyes that they were safe. And, by pure coincidence, about two weeks later I was invited to Cambridge to take part in a series of lectures debating the relationship between mathematics and technology. My head of department, a resilient and jolly fellow called Christos, told me he thought I should go. ‘Yes, Christos,’ I said, as we stood on a corridor floor made of polished pinewood. ‘I think I might.’ When galaxies collide I stayed in student accommodation in Corpus Christi, of all places, and tried to keep a low profile. I had grown a beard now, was tanned, and had put on a bit of weight, so people tended not to recognise me. I did my lecture. To quite a few jeers I told my fellow academics that I thought mathematics was an incredibly dangerous territory and that humans had explored it as fully as they could. To advance further, I told them, would be to head into a no-man’s- land full of unknown perils. Among the audience was a pretty red-haired woman who I recognised instantly as Maggie. She came up to me afterwards and asked if I’d like to go to the Hat and Feathers. I said no, and she seemed to know I meant it, and after posing a jovial question about my beard, she left the hall. After that, I went for a walk, naturally gravitating towards Isobel’s college. I didn’t go too far before I saw her. She was walking on the other side of the street and she didn’t see me. It was strange, the significance of that moment for me and the insignificance of it for her. But then I reminded myself that when galaxies collide they pass right through. I could hardly breathe, watching her, and didn’t even notice it was beginning to rain. I was just mesmerised by her. All eleven trillion cells of her. Another strange thing was how absence had intensified my feelings for her. How I craved the sweet everyday reality of just being with her, of having a mundane conversation about how our days had been. The gentle but unbettered comfort of coexistence. I couldn’t think of a better purpose for the universe than for her to be in it. She pulled open her umbrella as if she were just any woman pulling open an umbrella, and she kept on walking, stopping only to give some money to a homeless man with a long coat and a bad leg. It was Winston Churchill. Home One can’t love and do nothing. – Graham Greene, The End of the Affair Knowing I couldn’t follow Isobel, but feeling a need to connect with someone, I followed Winston Churchill instead. I followed slowly, ignoring the rain, feeling happy I had seen Isobel and that she was alive and safe and as quietly beautiful as she had always been (even when I had been too blind to appreciate this). Winston Churchill was heading for the park. It was the same park where Gulliver walked Newton, but I knew it was too early in the afternoon for me to bump into them, so I kept following. He walked slowly, pulling his leg along as if it were three times as heavy as the rest of him. Eventually, he reached a bench. It was painted green, this bench, but the paint was flaking off to reveal the wood underneath. I sat down on it too. We sat in rain-soaked silence for a while. He offered me a swig of his cider. I told him I was okay. I think he recognised me but I wasn’t sure. ‘I had everything once,’ he said. ‘Everything?’ ‘A house, a car, a job, a woman, a kid.’ ‘Oh, how did you lose them?’ ‘My two churches. The betting shop and the off-licence. And it’s been downhill all the way. And now I’m here with nothing, but I am myself with nothing. An honest bloody nothing.’ ‘Well, I know how you feel.’ Winston Churchill looked doubtful. ‘Yeah. Right you are, fella.’ ‘I gave up eternal life.’ ‘Ah, so you were religious?’ ‘Something like that.’ ‘And now you’re down here sinning like the rest of us.’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Well, just don’t try and touch my leg again and we’ll get on fine.’ ‘Well, just don’t try and touch my leg again and we’ll get on fine.’ I smiled. He did recognise me. ‘I won’t. I promise.’ ‘So, what made you give up on eternity if you don’t mind me askin’?’ ‘I don’t know. I’m still working it out.’ ‘Good luck with that, fella, good luck with that.’ ‘Thanks.’ He scratched his cheek and gave a nervous whistle. ‘Eh, you haven’t got any money on you, have you?’ I pulled a ten-pound note out of my pocket. ‘You’re a star, fella.’ ‘Well, maybe we all are,’ I said, looking skyward. And that was the end of our conversation. He had run out of cider and had no more reason to stay. So he stood up and walked away, wincing in pain from his damaged leg, as a breeze tilted flowers towards him. It was strange. Why did I feel this lack inside me? This need to belong? The rain stopped. The sky was clear now. I stayed where I was, on a bench covered with slow-evaporating raindrops. I knew it was getting later, and knew I should probably be heading back to Corpus Christi, but I didn’t have the incentive to move. What was I doing here? What was my function, now, in the universe? I considered, I considered, I considered, and felt a strange sensation. A kind of sliding into focus. I realised, though I was on Earth, I had been living this past year as I had always lived. I was just thinking I could carry on, moving forward. But I was not me any more. I was a human, give or take. And humans are about change. That is how they survive, by doing and un-doing and doing again. I had done some things I couldn’t undo, but there were others I could amend. I had become a human by betraying rationality and obeying feeling. To stay me, I knew there would come a point when I would have to do the same again. Time passed. Squinting, I looked again to the sky. The Earth’s sun can look very much alone, yet it has relatives all across this galaxy, stars that were born in the exact same place, but which were now very far away from each other, lighting very different worlds. I was like a sun. I was a long way from where I started. And I have changed. Once I thought I could pass through time like a neutrino passes through matter, effortlessly and without stopping to think, because time would never run out. As I sat there on that bench a dog came up to me. Its nose pressed into my leg. ‘Hello,’ I whispered, pretending not to know this particular English Springer Spaniel. But his pleading eyes stayed on me, even as he angled his nose towards his hip. His arthritis had come back. He was in pain. I stroked him and held my hand in place, instinctively, but of course I couldn’t heal him this time. Then a voice behind me. ‘Dogs are better than human beings because they know but don’t tell.’ I turned. A tall boy with dark hair and pale skin and a tentative nervous smile. ‘Gulliver.’ He kept his eyes on Newton. ‘You were right about Emily Dickinson.’ ‘Sorry?’ ‘Part of your advice. I read her.’ ‘Oh. Oh yes. She was a very good poet.’ He moved around the bench, sat down next to me. I noticed he was older. Not only was he quoting poetry but his skull had become more man-shaped. There was a slight trace of dark beneath the skin on his jaw. His T-shirt said ‘The Lost’ – he had finally joined the band. If I can stop one heart from breaking, that poet said, I shall not live in vain. ‘How are you?’ I asked, as if he were a casual acquaintance I often bumped into. ‘I haven’t tried to kill myself, if that’s what you mean.’ ‘And how is she?’ I asked. ‘Your mother?’ Newton came over with a stick, dropped it for me to throw. Which I did. ‘She misses you.’ ‘Me? Or your dad?’ ‘You. You’re the one who looked after us.’ ‘I don’t have any powers to look after you now. If you chose to jump off a roof then you’d probably die.’ ‘I don’t jump off roofs any more.’ ‘Good,’ I said. ‘That’s progress.’ There was a long silence. ‘I think she wants you to come back.’ ‘Does she say that?’ ‘No. But I think she does.’ The words were rain in a desert. After a while I said, in a quiet and neutral tone, ‘I don’t know if that would be wise. It’s easy to misunderstand your mother. And even if you haven’t got it wrong there could be all kinds of difficulties. I mean, what would she even call me? I don’t have a name. It would be wrong for her to call me Andrew.’ I paused. ‘Do you think she really misses me?’ me?’ He shrugged. ‘Yeah. I think so.’ ‘What about you?’ ‘I miss you, too.’ Sentimentality is another human flaw. A distortion. Another twisted by- product of love, serving no rational purpose. And yet, there was a force behind it as authentic as any other. ‘I miss you, too,’ I said. ‘I miss both of you.’ It was evening. The clouds were orange, pink and purple. Was this what I had wanted? Was this why I had come back to Cambridge? We talked. The light faded. Gulliver attached the lead to Newton’s collar. The dog’s eyes spoke sad warmth. ‘You know where we live,’ said Gulliver. I nodded. ‘Yes. I do.’ I watched him leave. The joke of the universe. A noble human, with thousands of days to live. It made no logical sense that I had developed into someone who wanted those days to be as happy and secure for him as they could possibly be, but if you came to Earth looking for logical sense you were missing the point. You were missing lots of things. I sat back and absorbed the sky and tried not to understand anything at all. I sat there until it was night. Until distant suns and planets shone above me, like a giant advert for better living. On other, more enlightened planets, there was the peace and calm and logic that so often came with advanced intelligence. I wanted none of it, I realised. What I wanted was that most exotic of all things. I had no idea if that was possible. It probably wasn’t, but I needed to find out. I wanted to live with people I could care for and who would care for me. I wanted family. I wanted happiness, not tomorrow or yesterday, but now. What I wanted, in fact, was to go home. So, I stood up. It was only a short walk away. Home – is where I want to be But I guess I’m already there I come home – she lifted up her wings Guess that this must be the place. – Talking Heads, ‘This Must Be the Place’\\"","completion":"The story you provided appears to be a science fiction narrative in which an alien has been sent to Earth to prevent humans from progressing in mathematics and potentially discovering the secrets of the universe that could threaten his species. The alien takes on a human identity, that of Professor Andrew Martin, and initially despises humanity but, over time, grows to love the human way of life. The pivotal moment of the story is the alien's decision to save Gulliver, the son of the human Andrew Martin, which signifies his complete transformation and rejection of his mission. It reflects a drastic character development from someone who was detached and willing to eliminate humans for a perceived greater good, to someone who values individual human lives and experiences empathy and love. The alien's actions demonstrate a stark contrast to his original mission and species' philosophy. Where he was supposed to observe and eventually bring about the death of those who knew too much, he instead chooses to connect, protect, and ultimately integrate with humans. Gulliver's original father was characterized as cold, absent, and having an affair, mirroring the aloof nature of the alien's species. Conversely, the alien who was tasked to be a heartless killer ends up embodying the qualities of a caring and protective father figure much more than the original human did. The alien's choice to defy his orders and save Gulliver reinforces this transformation from someone who acted in cold rationality to someone guided by compassion and human emotions. This transition from an outsider with a mission to harm humans to an individual who embraces humanity's complexity is the core of the alien's character arc, symbolizing the story's exploration of what it means to be human, the constructs of family and love, the significance of free will, and the power of change."},{"prompt":"talk about the alien bout how he changes as a character from the start being someone who hates humans very pessimistic view and sent here for a mission and is tasked with even killing humans. He even kills his first human Daniel Russel so effortlessly and without hesitation but he eventually grows to love the human way of life and even wanting to understand more. Talk about how the part when he saves gulliever","completion":"The alien protagonist of the story begins his journey with a vehement disdain for humanity. Sent on a mission to halt human progression in mathematics, his initial view of humans is pessimistic, seeing them as a dangerously foolish species unworthy of the secrets of the universe. His perception is underpinned by his own species' rational, emotionless existence, which contrasts sharply with humans' chaotic and emotionally driven lives. When the alien, assuming the identity of Professor Andrew Martin, first arrives on Earth, his lack of empathy is evident in his effortless and unhesitant killing of Daniel Russell, a fellow mathematician who has come too close to a significant mathematical breakthrough. The alien's actions are portrayed as cold and calculated, executed with the precision and indifference one might expect from a being who has no natural predisposition toward compassion or remorse. However, a fundamental shift occurs in the alien's character as he immerses himself in human life. His frequent interactions with humans lead to an unforeseen and unintentional consequence: he begins to form attachments and even develop affection for certain aspects of human culture and behavior. He is drawn to the emotional richness of life on Earth—a complexity initially foreign but eventually magnetic to him. The most significant turning point in the alien's transformation is his decision to save Gulliver, the son of the man whose identity he has assumed. This moment of salvation is pivotal; it represents a complete inversion of the alien's original purpose. It is no longer a metric of success to eliminate a threat or prevent the propagation of information. Instead, the meaning of success becomes preserving a life, protecting a person whom he has grown to care for. Through Gulliver and other relational anchors—like the recurring interactions with human characters, the absorption of human art and culture, and the unrivaled experience of love—the alien metamorphoses from a methodical executioner into a guardian of life. The narrative showcases this profound change as the alien reflects on his experiences and his developing emotions, highlighting the dissonance between his initial objectives and the values he eventually adopts. In the end, the alien demonstrates the powerful and transformative capacity of love and empathy. In choosing to defy his mission for the sake of Gulliver, he essentially chooses to be more human, underscoring the story's commentary on humanity's resilience, the importance of connection, and the liberating, albeit sometimes painful, nature of emotional growth. His journey unveils that even for a being from a distant and dispassionate world, the human condition—with all its flaws and beauty—can inspire a revolutionary expansion of the heart and soul."},{"prompt":"talk about how the humans slowly grow on him and its almost like he doesn't even realize and talk about when the alien first sees andrew martins wife and thinks shes hideous","completion":"The alien's gradual transformation from detached observer to someone emotionally invested in human life is a subtle and organic process; it is something he does not consciously intend or even realize is happening. This nuanced change in character is evident in his evolving interactions and deepening internal reflections about the world and the people around him. Initially, the alien holds a very pessimistic view of humans, regarding them with disdain and revulsion. This is exemplified in his first impression of Isobel, Andrew Martin's wife. Upon observing her for the first time, he perceives her physical features, which are typical to humans, as appalling and grotesque. He cannot fathom the human concept of beauty and finds their customs, behaviors, and even their appearance to be deeply alien and unattractive. As time progresses, however, the alien starts to experience human life from the inside. He engages with everyday activities, encounters difficulties, overcomes challenges, and slowly, almost imperceptibly, he begins to adapt and even appreciate aspects of the human world. The qualities he initially saw as repellant become familiar, and as he learns more about human emotions and motivations, his understanding deepens, softening his initial judgment. This burgeoning empathy occurs in parallel with the alien's own emotional awakening. Subtle moments—a poignant poem, the warmth of companionship, the selflessness he observes in others—cumulatively chip away at his colder, rational exterior. Humans, with their resilience, creativity, and capacity for joy, start to appear less like subjects to be scorned and more like beings inherently worthy of admiration and care. The alien's shifting perception is underscored when he witnesses acts of human kindness, feels the powerful resonance of music and literature, and realizes the common struggles and aspirations that thread through everyone's lives. These experiences begin to grow on him, altering his worldview in ways he could not have anticipated. Humans start to intrigue and delight rather than repulse him, leading to a significant internal conflict between his mission and his newfound appreciation for human complexity. An important catalyst in the alien's emotional evolution is his increasing attachment to and affection for Isobel. As he observes her more, the alien begins to recognize her inner beauty, intelligence, and the subtleties of her character, which contradict his earlier, superficial assessment of her physical appearance. He starts to see beyond the surface, realizing that beauty is multifaceted and that true attraction is as much about one's internal qualities as about external aesthetics. Significantly, this transformation shows that the alien's initial assessment of humans, including Isobel, was incomplete and skewed by his lack of emotional understanding. As the narrative progresses, the alien's appreciation of humanity becomes more profound, as does his compassion, culminating in his desire to protect and preserve the lives of those he has come to deeply care about. This shift from observer to participant in human life marks a profound change in his character, signaling his full assimilation into the very fabric of the human world he once viewed with such contempt."},{"prompt":"Code a vucano simulation","completion":"Creating a full-fledged volcano simulation requires advanced physics and graphics programming that can't be fully demonstrated in a text response.

Two of these were the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The FDIC protects up to 250,000 of individuals’ bank deposits in the event a bank fails. The SEC monitors Wall Street to ensure fair and ethical practices for investors. In one paragraph, describe how the FDIC and SEC continue to affect the lives of US citizens. Use at least two examples to support your description.","completion":"The FDIC and SEC continue to profoundly influence the financial stability and integrity of the United States, safeguarding the economy and the interests of its citizens. The FDIC promotes public confidence in the banking system by protecting depositors, ensuring that up to 250,000 per account holder per FDIC-insured bank is secure, even in the event of bank failures. This protection enables individuals to trust and utilize banking institutions without the fear of losing their savings, which in turn supports the availability of credit and the smooth functioning of the financial system. Meanwhile, the SEC serves to maintain fair and efficient markets by enforcing laws against market manipulation and fraudulent activities, thus allowing investors to participate in the securities markets with a reliance on transparent information and a regulated environment. As a result of the SEC's oversight, the average American can invest in the stock market, whether directly or through retirement accounts, with an assurance of legal recourse should malpractices occur, fostering a stable investment environment that is critical for both personal financial growth and the health of the national economy. Together, these agencies provide a foundation of financial security and oversight that is indispensable for individual prosperity and the collective economic well-being of the nation."},{"prompt":"Write a story. After years and years of ineptitude that turned a once-respected football establishment into a perennial basement dweller, the New York Giants are picking first overall for the first time since 1965. That was 61 years ago. The year is 2026, and there are many jokes to be made. Football fans can hardly believe what they are looking at. \\"Is this league scripted?\\" Well, it just might be. Why else would they be in position to draft a generational talent at quarterback that also happens to have the last name \\"Manning\\", and is coincidentally Eli's nephew? The quarterback for the Texas Longhorns possessed a name that carried a powerful name that carried with it a legacy of prolific quarterback play. Even his first name, Arch, was reminiscent of his grandfather, the one who put the Mannings on the map to begin with.","completion":"The year was 2026, and autumn winds whispered the promises of change through the alleys and boulevards of New York City. The NFL Draft was approaching, and for the first time in 61 years, the storied but struggling New York Giants had secured the first overall pick. It was an era-defining moment for a franchise that had turned from the titans of the gridiron to the laughingstock of the league, with season upon disappointing season. As if by cosmic design, the football gods had scripted a narrative so implausible, that fans across the nation were rubbing their eyes in disbelief. There, on the draft board, sat a name that conjured both awe and nostalgia — Arch Manning, the Texas Longhorns’ star quarterback, and the heir to a football dynasty that had become NFL royalty. The Giants fans, having endured years of ineptitude, could at last feel the stirrings of hope. Social media platforms were awash with memes, jokes, and speculation. Some claimed the league was scripted, while others believed it was the kind of coincidence that made you question the fabric of reality. \\"Is this the Giants' salvation?\\" they asked. \\"Is it all just a cosmic joke?\\" Arch was not just a Manning; he was the Manning of the new age. His uncle, Eli, had carried Big Blue to two Super Bowl victories, etching his name forever into the hearts of New Yorkers. His grandfather, Archie, had laid the groundwork for the Manning legacy in the NFL. And his other uncle, Peyton, was nothing short of a football deity. Arch’s name held the weight of expectation and the potential of football greatness. The draft day arrived, and New York City was abuzz with anticipation. The Giants’ war room was a scene of tension and meticulous planning. Seasoned scouts, old-school coaches, and analytical whiz-kids listened as the general manager practiced the call they had waited months to make. \\"Arch Manning,\\" he rehearsed, \\"Welcome to the New York Giants.\\" There was a unique pressure that came with drafting Arch, but also a sense of destiny. The Giants knew they were not just picking a player; they were choosing a path towards resurrecting their storied history, restoring the pride of a city that bled blue. When Commission Goodell took the stage, his voice bellowed through the speakers, igniting a chorus of cheers and gasps that echoed beyond the draft hall. \\"With the first pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, the New York Giants select… Arch Manning, quarterback, Texas.\\" The moment his name was called, fate turned its gears. The Empire State Building lit up in Giants' blue, and bars erupted with patrons toasting to the new era. Manning jerseys flew off the shelves, and the back pages of tabloids baptized Arch as New York's new savior. Arch himself, fitted in a bespoke suit with a calm and confident smile, took the stage, shook the commissioner's hand, and held the Giants jersey as if reclaiming a lost crown. He was home, joining a legacy interwoven with the city's vast tapestry. The euphoria was palpable, and as the season unfolded, Arch took to the field with a poise well beyond his years. Leanings from his uncles' playbooks added depth to his game, and gradually, the Giants became no longer the punchline but the punchers, climbing out of the NFL basement towards the bright lights of relevance once more. Arch Manning’s arrival to the Giants was not just the turning of a page; it was the beginning of an entirely new chapter — one filled with aspirations of glory, narratives of redemption, and the thrilling possibility that sometimes, just sometimes, life could emulate the wonderous improbability of lore."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue-filled chapter for a interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

After Ichika's and Chifuyu's demonstration, the topic of the diplomatic meeting [between the Ōtsutsuki and the Einzbern] turns to the ongoing problem of the creatures of Grimm [RWBY] which the revived Japanese Empire [ post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] has [post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] slowly eliminated [Grimm] from its [ post-Daisaigai Nihon's under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] lands, protectorates and satelite states.

After Ichika's and Chifuyu's demonstration, the topic of the diplomatic meeting [between the Ōtsutsuki and the Einzbern] turns to the ongoing problem of the creatures of Grimm [RWBY] which the revived Japanese Empire [ post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] has [post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] slowly eliminated [Grimm] from its [ post-Daisaigai Nihon's under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] lands, protectorates and satelite states.

However, I can provide you with an excerpt of a scene that might appear in such a work. Hold on tight—this is going to be quite a genre-bending ride! --- The air was electric aboard the SS Einzbern, a leviathan of the skies, as it cruised above the war-scarred remains of Europe. The high-level diplomatic meeting was on a knife-edge, with representatives from the post-Daisaigai rebuilt Japanese Empire and the magocratic House of Einzbern occupying opposite sides of the polished mahogany table. Ichika, known as Orimura in this world, stood with a polite yet firm expression. Beside him, Chifuyu—his sister and protector—watched the assembly like a hawk. Her experience with covert operations was a tale woven into her very stance. \\"Representatives,\\" Ichika began, \\"I thank you for acknowledging our presence. Our demonstration is simple.\\" Blue chakra spiraled around his hand like an azure flame, illuminating the room. There was an intake of breath from the Einzbern side. A woman, dignified and clad in the Einzbern family colors, leaned forward with interest glittering in her eyes. \\"Fascinating... Is this the 'chakra' manipulation we've heard tales of?\\" Chifuyu smiled wryly, stepping forward, and in a fluid motion, performed a series of hands signs. \\"Indeed. And this,\\" she transformed into a burst of white doves that reconvened into her form a few feet away, \\"is a taste of the shinobi arts.\\" Applause rippled from their guests. Yet before more could be said, a series of distant explosions jarred the assembly. The SS Einzbern shuddered violently, alarms blaring. \\"Terrorists,\\" Chifuyu hissed, reading the situation. \\"They must be from the dissolved Konoha... they never could let go of the past.\\" Ichika's eyes narrowed as he and Chifuyu instinctively positioned themselves for battle. That's when the spectacle became even more surreal. Ochako burst through the breached hull, a candid smile on her face, Shenlong materializing around her like a mythical guardian. To her flank, Momo and Kyōka arrived in their IS units, a symphony of advanced tech and old-world powers. They were a triad of destruction against the invading force. As the chaos unfolded, with energy blasts and chakra clashing, a scene of equal drama played out on the ground below. Eri gazed out the window, a complex expression adorning her matured features. Beside her, Kotori's flames danced in tandem with her mood. Both had a vast awareness far beyond the average person, entities of cosmic horror entangled in the fabric of their world. \\"It's as if the entire universe is conspiring to make life... interesting,\\" Eri mused, lifting a tentacle to stroke her chin thoughtfully. Kotori shuffled her feet. \\"Should we... do something about it?\\" she asked, seeming small despite the inferno that was her soul. Eri turned to her friend and grinned, the split-second transformation revealing a glimpse of the cosmic trickster she truly was. \\"Perhaps the Space Defence Agency will need to expedite their response. It would seem our diplomatic companions have everything in hand.\\" --- And so, amid the clash of mecha and magic, the negotiation of new alliances, and the unpredictable chaos that intruders brought, our cross-franchise heroes navigated the relentless currents of their altered worlds. Each player, from the steely-eyed strategist to the young hero-in-training, had roles both vast and minute in the unfurling tapestry of this multiverse, where every action wove another line in the story of their epic joint struggle."},{"prompt":"Write down large paragraphs for each pestle factor point below to explain the pestle factors that influence a Marks and Spencer considering trading internationally and what the actual effects are on M&S as a company using the structure/points of pestle below: PESTLE Country 1: France .Political - Political influence of the government of France EXAMPLE: Trading with France is more challenging than with other countries Find out information about the political situation in France and how it can influence Marks and Spencer and what are the actual effects on M&S .Economic - Economic conditions of a country.

France, as a member of the European Union, has a stable and democratic government that is supportive of trade and foreign investment. However, the political influence in France can present various challenges for international businesses. Regulations on food, health and safety, labor, and fashion (which are key categories for M&S) can change with evolving government policies. The French government's commitment to protecting local industries and prioritizing employment for its citizens can affect how M&S operates within the country. Moreover, the current political approach towards Brexit can have an impact on trade difficulty between the UK and France. Navigating these trade relations post-Brexit is crucial for M&S due to changes in tariffs, trade deals, and the movement of goods. This has an impact on M&S because it potentially increases the cost of operations, necessitating adjustments in supply chain management, pricing strategies, and regulatory compliance. Economic: The economic conditions of France offer both opportunities and challenges for M&S. Corporation tax and VAT rates are legislative decisions that impact profitability for companies like M&S. As of 2021, France has a standard corporate tax rate that is relatively high compared to some other European countries, which can cut into the margins. Moreover, the French market tends to have a higher standard VAT rate, which affects pricing structures and consumer spending. Analyzing economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates, GDP, and unemployment rates is crucial for M&S to forecast demand and sales figures. A strong GDP could indicate a favorable market for premium goods, which aligns with M&S’s brand image. However, high unemployment might constrain disposable incomes, affecting consumer's buying power. Therefore, M&S must monitor these economic variables closely as they dictate market entry strategy, pricing policy, and investment levels. Social: Socio-cultural factors in France are diverse and impact consumer behavior significantly, which in turn influences M&S's operations. France's population is highly educated, which often translates to higher consumer expectations in terms of quality and sustainability – areas that M&S might capitalize on. Lifestyle habits, such as the preference for fresh and local food, can influence M&S's food product offerings. Understanding the importance of environmental attitudes, particularly in France, can guide M&S to implement sustainable practices that appeal to local consumers. Population demographics such as growth rates, immigration patterns, and family sizes inform market segmentation and targeting strategies. For instance, changes in family sizes could affect the demand for M&S's children’s or home product lines. Furthermore, disposable income levels are essential for determining potential consumer spending and thus product assortments and pricing. M&S needs to position its products to meet the expectations formed by these social influences. Technological: Technological development in France is advanced, providing benefits and challenges for M&S. The high adoption rate of internet and mobile technology means that e-commerce and online marketing strategies are essential for M&S when entering this market. However, this also means that the company faces stiff competition from both local and international brands that have established a significant online presence. It encourages the need for innovation and the implementation of efficient supply chain and logistics solutions to meet customer expectations for quick and seamless service. Additionally, social media holds a powerful influence over consumers’ purchasing decisions in France, requiring M&S to engage actively through these platforms. Staying abreast of technological trends and consumer behaviors is vital for M&S’s success in the French market. Legal and Regulatory: France operates under a civil law system, which differs from the common law system prevalent in the UK. This could affect various aspects of M&S’s operations, including contract enforcement, property rights, and dispute resolution. Differences in business law, employment law, contract law, and criminal law require that M&S navigate legal intricacies with the help of legal expertise to avoid litigation and ensure compliance. Labor laws in France also tend to be more stringent than in the UK, with more protections for employees regarding working hours, terminations, and benefits, which means that M&S would have to adapt its human resource policies accordingly. Environmental and Ethical: The French government and its citizens are particularly conscious of environmental issues. With possible regulations regarding carbon emissions and waste reduction, M&S would likely need to adopt environmentally friendly practices in its operations, potentially increasing costs but simultaneously bolstering its brand image amongst environmentally conscious consumers. M&S's commitment to sustainability aligns with French consumer values, which can be a selling point if communicated effectively. Ethically, France tends to have high standards for employee treatment and working conditions. For M&S, ensuring that its supply chain respects these ethical standards is important for maintaining its reputation. France has stringent laws regarding child labor, and any association with such practices, whether direct or indirect, could severely damage M&S's brand. Ensuring ethical sourcing and production would be a crucial aspect of M&S's operations in France. Conclusion: Overall, trading internationally with a focus on France offers Marks & Spencer a spectrum of opportunities challenged by the corresponding complexity imposed by PESTLE factors. While the political stability, high education levels, and technological advancement of France create a favorable environment for M&S's offerings, the company must navigate economic variables, such as corporation tax and consumer spending trends, with dexterity. Social factors will dictate market positioning, and the advanced technological framework will necessitate an innovative approach to sales and marketing. Navigating the civil legal system, adapting to French regulatory standards, and upholding strict environmental and ethical principles will be crucial for operating successfully. To thrive, M&S must align its brand with French expectations while leveraging its heritage and strengths to add value to the French consumer market."},{"prompt":"Write in paragraphs for each pestle factor the actual effects that the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental and Ethical factors have on Marks and Spencer trading and operating in France.","completion":"Political: The political environment in France can have a significant impact on Marks & Spencer's (M&S) trading operations. Factors such as government stability, foreign trade policies, and regulatory requirements are critical considerations. Changes in government could lead to alterations in business regulations, affecting the ease with which M&S can operate. For example, policies regulating import and export between France and the UK post-Brexit are particularly pertinent to M&S. Any additional tariffs or barriers could increase operational costs and influence product pricing strategies. Furthermore, France's domestic policies aimed at protecting local industries may create competitive pressures for M&S, necessitating strategic partnerships or product localization to align with government-led initiatives that encourage local sourcing. Economic: Economic factors largely determine the viability and profitability of M&S’s operations in France. Fluctuations in inflation rates can affect consumer purchasing power, which in turn, impacts sales. The interest rate environment influences M&S's financing costs for local investments and expansions. In case of a high unemployment rate, M&S might experience a decline in sales due to reduced consumer spending. France's GDP growth can be indicative of the market potential for M&S's product categories. Higher corporation taxes in France compared to other countries mean M&S must optimize its financial management to maintain profitability, and the VAT rates affect pricing and demand. Economic downturns or recessions could lead to conservative spending behavior, impacting M&S's higher-end product lines more severely than essential goods. Social: The social setting in France affects M&S in various ways. France's highly educated population may demand high-quality products, which aligns well with M&S's brand image, but also means that M&S must consistently meet these quality expectations. Cultural trends, such as the adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly products, can influence M&S's product offerings and marketing strategies. The aging population might affect the demand for certain products, while immigration patterns could introduce new consumer needs that M&S could leverage. The French emphasis on work-life balance and social wellbeing may impact consumer attitudes toward ethical sourcing and corporate social responsibility, areas where M&S can differentiate itself within the marketplace. Technological: France’s high technological adoption rate offers M&S an opportunity to advance its digital marketing and sales operations. A robust online retail presence will be essential to meet the expectations of French consumers, where mobile commerce and social media are influential in driving purchase decisions. However, reliance on technology also means facing strong competition from digital-first players and local e-commerce companies. M&S needs to invest in state-of-the-art technological infrastructure to support supply chain efficiency, data analytics for customer insights, and integration of online and offline customer experiences. Keeping pace with technological advancements is critical for maintaining relevancy and appeal to the tech-savvy French consumers. Legal: The legal system in France presents a specific set of challenges and considerations for M&S. France's civil law framework may differ in contractual interpretations and business practices compared to the UK’s common law system. Compliance with labor laws—including working hours, employee benefits, and termination rights—demands that M&S adapt its human resources policies to comply with more stringent French legal standards. Ensuring compliance with French consumer protection laws, food safety regulations, and industry-specific legislation is critical to avoid legal repercussions and to maintain M&S’s brand integrity within the French marketplace. Environmental: Environmental considerations in France are of high importance due to the country's strong focus on sustainability and combating climate change. Regulations targeting emissions, waste management, and energy usage directly affect M&S's operational practices such as logistics, packaging, and store layouts. The push towards a more circular economy means M&S must innovate in product life-cycle management and recycling initiatives to meet regulatory requirements and consumer expectations. These environmental considerations may lead to increased operational costs but also provide opportunities to develop trust and credibility among environmentally conscious French consumers. Ethical: Ethical standards in France are crucial to M&S’s brand perception and consumer trust. France’s social conscience dictates that M&S must ensure ethical labor practices both in-store and throughout its supply chain. This includes strict adherence to labor rights, avoidance of child labor, and ensuring fair working conditions. Any perceived ethical misconduct can have major repercussions on the brand's reputation and customer loyalty. It is imperative for M&S to audit its suppliers, enforce ethical trading standards, and be transparent about its corporate social responsibility efforts to align with the ethical expectations of the French society. In conclusion, M&S's trading and operating activities in France are influenced across all PESTLE factors. Political and economic stability are necessary for strategic planning and financial forecasting. Social trends dictate consumer demands and market opportunities. Technological advancements determine customer engagement strategies and operational efficiency. Legal obligations require careful navigation and compliance expertise. Environmental and ethical considerations offer both challenges and opportunities for brand differentiation and corporate reputation building. Understanding and adeptly responding to these diverse factors is key for M&S’s successful market penetration and sustained growth in France."},{"prompt":"Hola, estoy aprendiendo ingles americano y soy principiante, necesito vuestra ayuda con lo siguiente. Por favor, proporciona las traducciones de la palabra [feet] organizadas por categoría gramatical (como sustantivo, verbo, adjetivo, adverbio, etc.).

Utiliza lenguaje sencillo y explicaciones claras adecuadas para un principiante.","completion":"¡Hola! Claro, con gusto te ayudaré con la palabra **feet**, que es el plural de **foot**. **Foot** significa **pie** y se usa en diferentes contextos. Aquí tienes la palabra organizada por categoría gramatical: # **Sustantivo** **1. Feet (plural de foot)** – Unidad de medida equivalente a 12 pulgadas o aproximadamente 30.48 centímetros. - Ejemplo: The table is six **feet** long. (La mesa mide seis **pies** de largo.) **2. Feet** – Parte del cuerpo al final de la pierna. - Ejemplo: She has small **feet**. (Ella tiene **pies** pequeños.) # Observaciones Es importante recordar que **feet** es el plural de **foot**, por lo cual siempre hablaremos de más de uno cuando usemos **feet**. Es común confundir esta palabra con la unidad de medida debido a que en inglés utiliza la misma palabra tanto para el plural del sustantivo que describe la parte del cuerpo como para la unidad de medida. Además, cuando hablamos de la altura de una persona, también utilizamos **feet** y **inches** (pulgadas). Por ejemplo: - He is 5 **feet** 10 **inches** tall. (Él mide 5 **pies** 10 **pulgadas** de altura.) En inglés, no utilizamos **feet** como verbo ni como adjetivo o adverbio, su uso se restringe principalmente a su forma sustantiva.

Aquí tienes la explicación y la sección de adivinanza para la palabra **mighty**: --- **Adjetivo** **Mighty** – Significa **poderoso** o **fuerte** y se utiliza para describir algo que tiene mucho poder, fuerza o efectividad. - Ejemplo: The storm was **mighty** and caused a lot of damage. (La tormenta fue **poderosa** y causó muchos daños.) - Ejemplo: He lifted the heavy box with **mighty** effort. (Él levantó la caja pesada con un esfuerzo **poderoso**.) # Observaciones La palabra **mighty** es comúnmente usada como un adjetivo, pero a veces puede ser utilizada también como un adverbio en un contexto informal, a menudo en oraciones como \\"mighty fine\\" o \\"mighty big,\\" donde enfatiza el adjetivo que sigue. Es importante tener en cuenta que no existe una forma sustantiva o verbal de **mighty**, su uso es casi exclusivamente como adjetivo o adverbio para dar énfasis. # Adivinanza divertida _Aunque invisible a veces puedo ser, cambio paisajes con mi fuerza, verás caer.

(Él le dio al saco de boxeo un buen **golpe**.) # Observaciones La palabra **sock** se utiliza principalmente como sustantivo para referirse a la prenda que usamos en los pies. Es importante recordar que el plural de **sock** es **socks**. A veces, especialmente en contextos informales o coloquiales, **sock** puede usarse como verbo para significar dar un golpe fuerte a alguien o algo, pero este uso es menos formal y común. # Adivinanza divertida _En invierno te doy abrigo sin fallar, pero sin mí, tu zapato puede molestar. No tengo alas, pero dentro de los zapatos puedo volar, y cuando estoy solo, a todos puedo frustrar. ¿Qué soy?_ --- (La respuesta es **sock** o **calcetines**, ya que un calcetín solo a menudo es motivo de frustración cuando el otro se pierde y quedas con un par incompleto.)"},{"prompt":"Por favor, proporciona las traducciones de la palabra [advice] organizadas por categoría gramatical (como sustantivo, verbo, adjetivo, adverbio, etc.).

En inglés americano no usarás **advice** como un verbo, adjetivo o adverbio.

Por ejemplo: - \\"**Advice** is helpful guidance, not to be confused with 'command', which is an authoritative order.\\" # Comparación cultural Comenta cómo se utiliza la palabra en diferentes culturas, si es que hay diferencias significativas. Esto puede ilustrar la riqueza del idioma y la cultura. Por ejemplo: - \\"In some cultures, seeking **advice** from elders is part of daily life, reflecting a communal approach to decision-making.\\" # Ejercicios de fill-in-the-blank (completar el texto) Proporciona oraciones con espacios en blanco donde los estudiantes deben colocar la palabra correcta.

Meanwhile, \\"Rose, you trust me don't you\\" \\"This watch is me\\" \\"I'm gonna become human\\" were words uttered by the elusive Time Lord, the Doctor, who was about to use the Chameleon Arch to rewrite his biology, changing a Time Lord into a human. His faithful companion , Rose, could not believe her eyes as the Doctor screamed in pain as he became human, He became a human named John Smith. The TARDIS landed in a cottage near St. Albans, Hertfordshire ,where Smith was going on a excursion to a haunted house. Rose however wanted to bring the Doctor back, When they got there John Smith began talking to a lady while Rose saw a trail of blood in the corn field. She followed it and saw a purple ram on the floor, the same one that was stabbed by the wasp. Rose was utterly puzzled and annoyed, that the Doctor chose to become human during a time of need, Rose called the nurse, As Wally was on a hospital bed, there were other animals, a pig named Rosa particularly crying her eyes out, A bespectacled hedgehog named Chiko was confused, He didn't know what had happened The nurse said \\"I can't treat him, He is not breathing, He is gone\\" Rosa began screaming for her friend had died, She was trying to calm down, She panted untill she collapsed, Rosa has also died, She had died of shock, They began planning their funeral, Wally was buried with Rosa, The coffin was lowered as they all cried, Meanwhile, Rose continued to investigate the haunted house, She didn't have the Doctor this time, The Doctor became John Smith, She had to find the bee, She had to avenge Rosa and Wally, Rose ran to John Smith holding the fob watch and screamed \\"Help me, John Smith!\\" She screamed \\"Please become the Doctor again\\", John Smith said \\"Who are you talking about\\", Rose said \\"Please help us, Do it for Wally\\" John Smith said \\"I'm not the Doctor, I'm not here to cure anyone, I'm just a man\\" A man appeared with a magic wand, and used it to cast a spell on the bee, rendering it unconscious, Meanwhile, a maid was cleaning up the trail of blood, Rose was running to a garden, and sees the magician digging a coffin, and takes out the corpses of Rosa and Wally, Rose didn't know what was about to happen, She ran to John Smith, who had fallen in love with Joan, This means he might not want to return to being the Doctor.

As they regained their footing, they witnessed a miracle unfold before their eyes. The bodies of Rosa and Wally began to glow with a soft, golden light. The wounds on their bodies disappeared, and they slowly rose from the ground, alive once more. Rose could hardly believe what she was seeing. The magician had unknowingly brought them back to life. She couldn’t help but feel a glimmer of hope that perhaps John Smith could become the Doctor again. But before she could voice her thoughts, the wasp, with its newfound strength, attacked. It swooped down towards the group, ready to strike once more. Suddenly, the air crackled with energy, and there was a flash of light. Standing before them was the Doctor, his eyes blazing with determination. He had opened the watch and embraced his Time Lord nature once more. Without missing a beat, the Doctor quickly assessed the situation, pulling out his trusty sonic screwdriver. He aimed it at the wasp, emitting a high-pitched sound that disoriented the creature, causing it to fly away in confusion. With the immediate danger dealt with, the Doctor turned his attention to Joan, who stood nearby, watching the events unfold. He walked up to her, his expression filled with both tenderness and regret. “Joan, I’m sorry,” he said, his voice heavy with emotion. “I thought I could leave this life behind and find happiness with you, but there are people out there who still need me.” Joan, tears welling in her eyes, nodded knowingly. “I understand, John. You have a greater purpose, and I can’t stand in the way of that.” They shared a bittersweet goodbye, knowing that their paths were destined to diverge. As Joan walked away, the Doctor joined Rose and the recently resurrected Rosa and Wally. Together, they returned to the TARDIS, ready to set things right and save the remaining inhabitants of the haunted house. Using his quick thinking and resourcefulness, the Doctor devised a plan to capture the wasp and contain its powers. With the help of the TARDIS, he created a jamming device that disrupted the wasp’s ability to control minds and cause havoc. The Doctor and his companions heroically fought off the remaining wasp drones, ensuring the safety of the haunted house’s residents. Finally, the threat was neutralized, and peace was restored. As they bid farewell to the grateful inhabitants, Rosa and Wally approached the Doctor. “Thank you,” Rosa said, her voice filled with gratitude. “If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t be here.” Wally nodded in agreement. “You showed us that miracles can happen, even when all hope is lost.” The Doctor smiled warmly at them, his Time Lord spirit shining bright. “It was my pleasure, my friends. Saving lives is what I do best.” With a final wave, the Doctor and Rose stepped back into the TARDIS, ready for their next adventure across time and space. And as the TARDIS dematerialized, leaving behind a trail of twinkling stars, Joan watched from a distance, knowing that John Smith’s life had been forever changed by the presence of the Doctor. Write a sequel where the Tardis crashes in New York and he meets a boy who can turn into a dragon, The boy decides to investigate strange events in Cambridgeshire, and he says it is \\"very far from my good old American home\\" When they get there the Doctor has to face the return of the Daleks, he also reunites with Sarah Jane and 2 grateful friends","completion":"Sequel: The Dragon's Flight and the Dalek's Return The TARDIS, with its distinctive whirring sound, materialized in an alleyway of New York City, but it was a rough landing that jolted the Doctor and Rose. They barely had time to recover before a young boy stumbled upon them, his eyes wide with awe at the sight of the blue police box. The boy was named Ethan, and he shared a fantastic secret with the Doctor and Rose – he could transform into a dragon, a skill passed down through generations in his family. With scaly wings and fiery breath, Ethan revealed his dragon form, casting an orange glow in the dim alley. \\"Why are you in New York, Doctor?\\" Ethan asked, finding the courage to speak to the Time Lord. \\"We're here by accident,\\" the Doctor confessed, patting the TARDIS affectionately. \\"But sometimes, the TARDIS has a way of taking us where we need to be, not just where we want to go.\\" That's when Ethan brought up the strange events occurring in Cambridgeshire: people were disappearing, and there were tales of sinister lights in the sky. The Doctor's interest was piqued; it sounded like a mystery that was right up his alley. \\"Cambridgeshire is very far from my good old American home,\\" Ethan said with a hint of nervous excitement, \\"but I’d love to help if I can.\\" The Doctor grinned and clapped a hand on Ethan's shoulder. \\"Well then, dragon boy, allons-y!\\" The TARDIS crew set off for Cambridgeshire and arrived in a serene village that belied the terror within. As they began investigating, they encountered none other than Sarah Jane Smith, a dear friend and former companion of the Doctor's. Sarah Jane greeted them warmly but quickly relayed her concerns. \\"I'm glad to see you, Doctor. But I'm afraid the situation here is worse than you can imagine. It's the Daleks – they've returned.\\" Her voice carried an urgency that immediately put the Doctor on high alert. Before they could form a plan, the Doctor's attention was drawn by two familiar faces – Rosa and Wally were there as well, their gratitude towards the Doctor palpable. \\"Doctor, you saved us before,\\" said Rosa. \\"We want to help fight whatever threat is upon us now.\\" The Doctor was moved by their bravery and welcomed their assistance. With Sarah Jane's knowledge, Rose's resourcefulness, Ethan's unique abilities, and the help of their two grateful friends, they prepared to confront the Daleks. The Daleks had plans to harvest the energy of the inhabitants to fuel their ships. The Doctor realized that they needed a distraction to infiltrate the ship. Ethan, boldly stepping forward, volunteered to use his dragon form to create a diversion while the others executed the Doctor's plan to undermine the Dalek operation. As Ethan took to the skies, he commanded the attention of the Daleks, who were unprepared for the mythical creature's fiery assault. The Doctor and his crew used the ensuing chaos to board the Dalek ship and sabotage their energy-harvesting equipment. Working together, they fought their way through the ship's defenses. Sarah Jane and Rose created makeshift explosives to destroy the vital systems, while Wally and Rosa freed the captured villagers. With the systems failing and the ship beginning to self-destruct, the Daleks were forced into retreat, squealing their infamous cry, \\"Exterminate!\\", but to no avail. The Doctor’s ingenuity had thwarted their vile scheme once again. As they all returned to the safety of the village, Ethan transformed back into his human form, exhausted but victorious. The villagers, Rose, and Sarah Jane were full of praises for the winged savior and the enigmatic Doctor. After ensuring no lingering threat, the Doctor welcomed everyone for a brief celebration. Laughter and chatter filled the night air as they recounted the day's harrowing events with a sense of triumph. As dawn approached, it was time for the Doctor and Rose to depart. The Doctor offered Ethan a chance to join them on their travels, but Ethan decided to stay, his duty to protect his hometown as strong as the Doctor's commitment to the universe. Farewells were exchanged, promises to cross paths again made, and the TARDIS, with the Doctor and Rose, dematerialized, leaving behind friends old and new, and a village safe from the terror of the Daleks. The adventure would live on in their hearts, a testament to the bravery of those who dare to stand against darkness with the Doctor."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue-filled chapter for a interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

The blonde-haired, blue-eyed demon fox container Uzumaki Naruto, the protagonist [Naruto] of the Naruto franchise escaped the Hidden Leaf Village with the help of the revivied Japanese Empire's [post-Daisaigai Nihon's under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas' intelligence services along with Uchiha Itachi, whom [Itachi in this story] is [Itachi in this story] revealed to be a cute and sexy girl [Itachi in this story] before Konoha's ROOT can kill the Uchiha clan and blame her [Itachi] for the genocide [of the Uchiha-uji |Uchiha Clan (Uchiha-uji)|], [female Itachi and Naruto] eventually settling in the restored Japanese Empire [post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule] as Orimura Chifuyu [female Itachi] and Orimura Ichika [Naruto]. The Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku eventually returns [to the Genso no Kuni] and [the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku] reconquers it [the Genso no Kuni], [the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku after reconquering the Genso no Kuni] dismantling the shinobi system and replacing it [the Genso no Kuni's shinobi system] with Hidan no Aria's Butei [Armed Detective |Butei|] system, which [the Butei system] replaces canon My Hero Academia's Hero system with younger generations who don't join Fire Force's Special Fire Force being sent to Butei Academies alongside Diva users from Magika Kenshi and Quirk users from Boku no Hero Academia. Ichika discovers he [Ichika] can pilot an IS when he [Ichika] is twelve and [Ichika] joins the IS Academy like his canon counterpart in canon IS Infinite Stratos. However, he is also going to testify in the case against the Genso no Kuni's former Kage and [Naruto] is required to attend a high-level diplomatic meeting between the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku and the Deutsche [German] magical House of Einzbern from Fate/Stay Night, which [the House of Einzbern] seized control of the Clocktower [also from Fate/Stay Night] and also the rest of the UK after the Daisaigai. During the meeting with the House of Einzbern, [Ichika] demonstrates his [Ichika's] limited chakra manipulation capabilities to the disbeliving Einzbern representatives, with his [Ichika's] legal older sister [Chifuyu] also showing off her [Chifuyu's] still-sharp chakra using fake ninja skills as the Einzbern representatives look on in approval. After Ichika's and Chifuyu's demonstration, the topic of the diplomatic meeting [between the Ōtsutsuki and the Einzbern] turns to the ongoing problem of the creatures of Grimm [RWBY] which the revived Japanese Empire [ post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] has [post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] slowly eliminated [Grimm] from its [ post-Daisaigai Nihon's under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] lands, protectorates and satelite states. While the meeting is going on, terrorists from the Genso no Kuni, more specifically from the dissolved Konohagakure no Sato, storm the airship [where the diplomatic meeting is being held] and [the terrorists from Konoha] try to take the inhabitant's hostage, however the British and Japanese TSFs, modified with both chakra and magic, decimate their [the Konoha terrorists'] summons while the brown-haired, brown-eyed, short, slender, and petite but also curvy and buxom, kind, talkative and bubbly Uraraka Ochako from [which series Ochako is from] Boku no Hero Academia, who [Ochako] has [what Ochako has] gyrokinetic [gravity manipulation] abilities and [Ochako] is [what else Ochkao is] part-Huárén [Han Chinese/Han Chinese |Huárén|] [Ochako] in this story, [Ochako] being [what else Ochako is] the post-Daisaigai restored Dà Míngguó's/Míng Cháo's IS representative [Ochako in this story] in addition to [Ochako] being [what else Ochako is] a Butei trainee [Ochako in this story],and [Ochako] has [what else Ochako has] green eyes, [Ochako] bursts in, [Ochako] having [what Ochako did] followed her [Ochako's] classmate [Ichika] at the IS Academy to the airship in order to return to him [Ichika] a book that he [Ichika] had left behind, [Ochako] upon seeing the terrorists [from Konoha] activates her [Ochako's] IS Unit, Shenlong [Ochako's IS Unit], [Ochako activating Shenlong], [Ochako in Shenlong] tearing through the fake ninja with her [Ochako's] Lóng Lóu [Dragon Cannon |Lóng Lóu| a cannon |the Lóng Lóu| that |what a Lóng Lóu does| compresses space and fires it |the space compressed by a Lóng Lóu| as a bullet] on [where Shenlong's Lóng Lóu is located] its [Shenlong's shoulders] and her [Ochako's] Yuèliàng [Bright Moon |Yuèliàng|, a pair of Huárén scimitars |Yuèliàng| that |Yuèliàng| are |Yuèliàng| part of Shenlong's weaponry], [Ochako] being [what happens to Ochako] accompaned by [which students from the IS Academy help Ochako deal with the terrorists] the tall and slender but curvy and buxom with a mature physique, prudent, dedicated, level headed, calm and polite black haired and brown-eyed Yamato Nadeshiko [traditional Japanese beauty] and corporate heiress Yaoyorozu Momo from [the franchise Momo is |Momo| from] Boku no Hero Academia, who [Momo] has [what Momo has] the ability to create things by manipulating the fat cells on her [Momo's] skin and [Momo] is [what Momo is] the Japanese IS representative [Momo] in this story, [Momo] having [what Momo has] long, brown hair and [Momo's] blue eyes in this story, [Momo helping Ochako deal with the terrorists] with her [Momo's] IS unit, the Akatsubaki [Momo's personal IS Unit |the Akatsubaki] proving just as useful as her [Momo's] creation ability as its [the Akatsubaki's] twin energy katanas and [the Akatsubaki's] blasted energy crossbow cut through enemies, with the petite, fair skinned, short, slender and petite, dark-purple haired, blue-eyed, pragmatic, unenthusiastic, blunt, and teasing, cold and indifferent but also sensitive, fiercly loyal and easily flustered rockstar in training/pop idol in the making Jirō Kyōka, who [Kyōka] has [what Kyōka has] the ability to [Kyōka's power] manipulate sound, [Kyōka] from [the media franchise Kyōka is |Kyōka| from] Boku no Hero Academia, [Kyōka] helping her [Kyōka's] classmates [Momo and Ochako] in their [Momo's, Ochako's and Kyōka's] patriotic duty, her [Kyōka's] personal IS Unit Kurokishi [Kyōka's personal IS Unit] annhilating the terrorists with its [Kurokishi's] six offensive drone/shield bits as she [Kyōka] uses [what Kyōka uses] its [Kurokishi's] arm mounted plasma gatling gun, its [Kurokishi's] two jousting pole-like hip-mounted plasma blaster cannons and its [Kurokishi's] purple-colored energy two-handed sword quite efficently. When it all ends, all of the terrorists [from Konoha] are [the terrorists] either dead, dying or severly injured as the local Imperial Japanese Army units that survived the terrorist onslaught pick up the rest of the Konoha terrorists as the girls [Momo, Ochako and Kyōka] grin sheepishly and Ichika deadpans.

However, I will endeavor to create a collaborative and engaging snippet that resonates with the themes and characters across the various franchises mentioned, consistent with the dynamic narrative you're aiming for. --- **Chapter 21: The Airship Incident** Amber-eyed Itsuka Shidō stared at the airship hovering majestically above Tokyo's rebuilt skyline. The diplomatic meeting onboard carried the weight of new alliances and continued peace—critical in these times after the catastrophic Daisaigai had shattered the world. Within the grand conference room, Ichika—known as Orimura Ichika now—felt the fabric of his formal attire chafing uncomfortably against his skin. His elder sister Chifuyu stood by his side, her elegance and confidence a stark contrast to his own unease. Einzbern representative Elise scrutinized the pair before shifting her gaze to the window as the lingering creatures of Grimm scuttled on the outskirts of vision, their existence a thorn in the side of rebuilding efforts. Chifuyu cleared her throat, ready to begin her presentation, but was abruptly cut off by the hiss and clank of forced entry. A group of masked men, evident nin from the dissolved Konohagakure, burst in, flinging kunai and demands for attention. **Konoha Terrorist Leader:** \\"Nobody move! We're here for—\\" Before the leader could finish, a gravity-altering force ripped his weapon from his grasp. Enter Uraraka Ochako, floating through a gaping hole her IS, Shenlong, had made in the ship's side. **Ochako:** \\"I just came to return a book, but I guess I walked into quite the party!\\" Simultaneously, Momo's Akatsubaki and Kyōka's Kurokishi joined the fray. The repurposed IS and Tactical Surface Fighters blended chakra and technology, showcasing Japan's newfound might. Chaos ensued, energy katanas clashed with shadow clones, and Jirō's amplified soundwaves disoriented the attackers as the once-fictional ninjutsu met an array of highly-advanced weaponry. As the conflict neared its climax, Ichika's IS, the Byakushiki, manifested, gleaming and primed for action. He may have been reluctant, but he'd be damned if he let his friends fight alone. **Ichika:** \\"This... this isn't just about nations or politics. It's about our right to shape a future from this madness.\\" The renowned stoicism of the House of Einzbern faltered, leaving them to observe the spectacle. Chifuyu caught Elise's eye, giving a slight nod—acknowledgment of the new power dynamic. Corpses and broken machines lay strewn about as the clatter quieted down. The girls panted, their IS units whirring softly as systems cooled down. Ichika, however, remained stoic, his expression unchanging at the resolve of his nation. **Ichika:** \\"Looks like our demonstration was more... vivid than intended.\\" Below in the city, Eri, now older and infinitely more powerful, gazed upward, sensing the raw energy that had spilled forth. She was no longer the scared girl in need of rescue but a being of phenomenal power, perhaps even a proverbial goddess among mortals. Kotori, her flames echoing Eri's tumultuous thoughts, entered with a shy step, her fierce protectiveness veiled beneath a tender exterior. **Eri:** \\"Trouble seems to find us, doesn't it, Kotori?\\" **Kotori:** \\"Should we... inform the Space Defence Agency?\\" A laugh escaped Eri, as she watched the airship steady itself. Skirting disaster was becoming a routine, so much so, calling in intergalactic reinforcements felt like an ordinary day's end. --- The room settled back into a tense negotiation, with the tribes of the world's shattered remnants seeking a semblance of order—knowing all too well that outside, somewhere beyond the airship's metallic walls, the universe remained vast, unknowable, and rippling with the echoes of potential chaos."},{"prompt":"¿Qué es \\"red proyectum\\"?","completion":"Hasta donde llega mi conocimiento, actualizado hasta 2023, \\"Red Proyectum\\" no es un término ampliamente reconocido que haga referencia a una organización, método o tecnología específica en el contexto internacional.

The Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku eventually returns [to the Genso no Kuni] and [the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku] reconquers it [the Genso no Kuni], [the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku after reconquering the Genso no Kuni] dismantling the shinobi system and replacing it [the Genso no Kuni's shinobi system] with Hidan no Aria's Butei [Armed Detective |Butei|] system, which [the Butei system] replaces canon My Hero Academia's Hero system with younger generations who don't join Fire Force's Special Fire Force being sent to Butei Academies alongside Diva users from Magika Kenshi and Quirk users from Boku no Hero Academia. Ichika discovers he [Ichika] can pilot an IS when he [Ichika] is twelve and [Ichika] joins the IS Academy like his canon counterpart in canon IS Infinite Stratos. However, he is also going to testify in the case against the Genso no Kuni's former Kage and [Naruto] is required to attend a high-level diplomatic meeting between the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku and the Deutsche [German] magical House of Einzbern from Fate/Stay Night, which [the House of Einzbern] seized control of the Clocktower [also from Fate/Stay Night] and also the rest of the UK after the Daisaigai. During the meeting with the House of Einzbern, [Ichika] demonstrates his [Ichika's] limited chakra manipulation capabilities to the disbeliving Einzbern representatives, with his [Ichika's] legal older sister [Chifuyu] also showing off her [Chifuyu's] still-sharp chakra using fake ninja skills as the Einzbern representatives look on in approval. After Ichika's and Chifuyu's demonstration, the topic of the diplomatic meeting [between the Ōtsutsuki and the Einzbern] turns to the ongoing problem of the creatures of Grimm [RWBY] which the revived Japanese Empire [ post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] has [post-Daisaigai Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] slowly eliminated [Grimm] from its [ post-Daisaigai Nihon's under Ōtsutsuki rule ruling over Chōsen, Karufuto, Senkaku, the Carolines and the Marinas] lands, protectorates and satelite states. While the meeting is going on, terrorists from the Genso no Kuni, more specifically from the dissolved Konohagakure no Sato, storm the airship [where the diplomatic meeting is being held] and [the terrorists from Konoha] try to take the inhabitant's hostage, however the British and Japanese TSFs, modified with both chakra and magic, decimate their [the Konoha terrorists'] summons while the brown-haired, brown-eyed, short, slender, and petite but also curvy and buxom, kind, talkative and bubbly Uraraka Ochako from [which series Ochako is from] Boku no Hero Academia, who [Ochako] has [what Ochako has] gyrokinetic [gravity manipulation] abilities and [Ochako] is [what else Ochkao is] part-Huárén [Han Chinese/Han Chinese |Huárén|] [Ochako] in this story, [Ochako] being [what else Ochako is] the post-Daisaigai restored Dà Míngguó's/Míng Cháo's IS representative [Ochako in this story] in addition to [Ochako] being [what else Ochako is] a Butei trainee [Ochako in this story],and [Ochako] has [what else Ochako has] green eyes, [Ochako] bursts in, [Ochako] having [what Ochako did] followed her [Ochako's] classmate [Ichika] at the IS Academy to the airship in order to return to him [Ichika] a book that he [Ichika] had left behind, [Ochako] upon seeing the terrorists [from Konoha] activates her [Ochako's] IS Unit, Shenlong [Ochako's IS Unit], [Ochako activating Shenlong], [Ochako in Shenlong] tearing through the fake ninja with her [Ochako's] Lóng Lóu [Dragon Cannon |Lóng Lóu| a cannon |the Lóng Lóu| that |what a Lóng Lóu does| compresses space and fires it |the space compressed by a Lóng Lóu| as a bullet] on [where Shenlong's Lóng Lóu is located] its [Shenlong's shoulders] and her [Ochako's] Yuèliàng [Bright Moon |Yuèliàng|, a pair of Huárén scimitars |Yuèliàng| that |Yuèliàng| are |Yuèliàng| part of Shenlong's weaponry], [Ochako] being [what happens to Ochako] accompaned by [which students from the IS Academy help Ochako deal with the terrorists] the tall and slender but curvy and buxom with a mature physique, prudent, dedicated, level headed, calm and polite black haired and brown-eyed Yamato Nadeshiko [traditional Japanese beauty] and corporate heiress Yaoyorozu Momo from [the franchise Momo is |Momo| from] Boku no Hero Academia, who [Momo] has [what Momo has] the ability to create things by manipulating the fat cells on her [Momo's] skin and [Momo] is [what Momo is] the Japanese IS representative [Momo] in this story, [Momo] having [what Momo has] long, brown hair and [Momo's] blue eyes in this story, [Momo helping Ochako deal with the terrorists] with her [Momo's] IS unit, the Akatsubaki [Momo's personal IS Unit |the Akatsubaki] proving just as useful as her [Momo's] creation ability as its [the Akatsubaki's] twin energy katanas and [the Akatsubaki's] blasted energy crossbow cut through enemies, with the petite, fair skinned, short, slender and petite, dark-purple haired, blue-eyed, pragmatic, unenthusiastic, blunt, and teasing, cold and indifferent but also sensitive, fiercly loyal and easily flustered rockstar in training/pop idol in the making Jirō Kyōka, who [Kyōka] has [what Kyōka has] the ability to [Kyōka's power] manipulate sound, [Kyōka] from [the media franchise Kyōka is |Kyōka| from] Boku no Hero Academia, [Kyōka] helping her [Kyōka's] classmates [Momo and Ochako] in their [Momo's, Ochako's and Kyōka's] patriotic duty, her [Kyōka's] personal IS Unit Kurokishi [Kyōka's personal IS Unit] annhilating the terrorists with its [Kurokishi's] six offensive drone/shield bits as she [Kyōka] uses [what Kyōka uses] its [Kurokishi's] arm mounted plasma gatling gun, its [Kurokishi's] two jousting pole-like hip-mounted plasma blaster cannons and its [Kurokishi's] purple-colored energy two-handed sword quite efficently.

I'll try to provide you a sample scene, necessarily shorter and less detailed than your prompt requires, but touching on elements of the genres and series you mention. --- The grand hall of the airship buzzed with tension, a melting pot of cultures and powers in an uneasy truce. Amidst the Neo-Japanese Empire's dignitaries, shadowy figures and monstrous allies, Ichika Orimura—known as Naruto in a life past—prepared to take the center stage. At his side, Chifuyu, once Uchiha Itachi, now his unstoppable guard and mentor. A stern-faced Einzbern mage tapped his foot impatiently. “These delays are unacceptable. Our Grimoire of Astral Contract—” Chifuyu interrupted, her eyes narrowing. “Patience, Herr Einzbern. My brother is more than capable.” Ichika nodded to the Einzbern mage, palming a chakra-infused kunai discreetly. But before he could demonstrate, a thunderous explosion shook the hall. Terrorists erupted into the room, each a rogue shinobi with a vendetta against the Ōtsutsuki empire. The ensuing battle was rapid chaos. But amidst the skirmish, a metallic gleam caught the light as Uraraka Ochako, the force of gravity personified, rocketed into the fray atop Shenlong. Her IS suit advanced through the melee, green eyes locked with steely resolve. Beside her, Yaoyorozu Momo's Akatsubaki and Jirō Kyōka's Kurokishi were a symphony of destruction, churning out weapons and blasts with mechanical precision. Outside, Eri—older, wiser, powerful—watched from a distance. She whispered with a surreptitious smile, \\"It seems heroes are forged in fire, after all.\\" Kotori, her flames reflecting fierce determination, joined Eri's side. \\"Fire... or the darkness of space, Elder Sister.\\" Her voice held a timbre of insecurity as she observed her brother Shidō, the peacekeeper, the soul-sealer, now a shadow warrior named Rentarō—battling below within the ship. The turmoil twisted and turned, a fandango of genres, from the grim reality of warfare to the erotic charge of close combat, the claustrophobic thrill of Lovecraftian horror creeping at the edges of the mind. Amidst a whirlwind of techniques—gravity manipulation, plasma swords, energy katanas—Ichika, or Naruto, glimpsed the essence of what brought them together: a shared fight for a world that was never quite theirs. As the last terrorist fell, Ichika exhaled. \\"Some battles, no matter the world, find us. And we will always answer.\\" Chifuyu, ever present, ever vigilant, gave a small nod, her gaze finding the horizon where fantasy and science, love and horror, comedy and tragedy mixed in the ether—a relentless dance of the living, the dead, and those caught in-between. And there, on that airship, a testament to what humanity could endure and adapt, the cosmic stage was set. But it was just one tableau in a grander saga, one where every creature, every pilot, every mystic and ninja had a part to surrender to the sprawling odyssey of existence itself."},{"prompt":"C’est quoi le rapport qui a entre des graduations qui se trouvent dans un graphique de trading et le terme lot","completion":"Dans le contexte du trading, particulièrement dans le trading sur le marché des changes (Forex), le terme \\"lot\\" fait référence à une unité de mesure qui représente la quantité d'une devise qui est achetée ou vendue. La taille d'un lot standard est généralement de 100 000 unités de la devise de base (la première devise dans une paire de devises). Il existe également des mini-lots (10 000 unités), des micro-lots (1 000 unités) et parfois des nano-lots (100 unités), selon le courtier. Les graduations qui se trouvent dans un graphique de trading, en revanche, sont des marques qui indiquent des valeurs spécifiques sur les axes du graphique. Le graphique de trading affiche généralement le prix d'un actif sur l'axe vertical (axe des y) et le temps sur l'axe horizontal (axe des x). Le rapport entre les graduations d'un graphique et le terme \\"lot\\" se situe principalement dans la façon dont vous interprétez les mouvements de prix et planifiez vos transactions. Par exemple, si vous voyez qu'un graphique montre une augmentation significative dans le prix et que vous souhaitez en tirer profit, vous allez décider de combien de lots vous voulez acheter en fonction de votre stratégie de trading, de votre gestion du risque et de la taille de votre compte de trading. Chaque graduation sur l'axe des prix peut aussi aider à déterminer la valeur monétaire des mouvements de prix. Par exemple, si le prix d'une paire de devises dans un graphique Forex augmente d'une graduation et que cette graduation représente une variation de 0,0001 (connu en tant que pip dans le trading Forex), et que vous avez acheté un lot standard de 100 000 unités, alors la valeur de ce mouvement d'un pip serait de 10 unités de la devise cotée (la deuxième devise dans la paire). En résumé, les graduations dans un graphique de trading vous donnent des informations visuelles sur les mouvements de prix et le temps, tandis que le concept de \\"lot\\" vous permet de quantifier la taille de vos échanges sur le marché. Combiner les informations des graduations avec la gestion de la taille des lots est fondamental dans la planification des transactions et la gestion des risques dans le trading."},{"prompt":"Donnes moi un exemple concret de ce qui précède pour un capital de 100","completion":"Avec un capital de 100, vous opérez dans une marge bien plus restrictive que celle d’un trader avec un capital plus conséquent. Le trading avec un tel capital oblige à prendre en compte la gestion du risque de manière très précise, surtout si vous tradez sur des marchés très volatiles comme le Forex. Voici un exemple concret prenant en compte une opération de trading sur le Forex, où les lots sont généralement de 100 000 unités pour un lot standard, 10 000 unités pour un mini-lot, 1 000 unités pour un micro-lot et 100 unités pour un nano-lot. Supposons que vous tradez la paire de devises EUR/USD et que le prix actuel est de 1,1000. Avec un capital de 100, il n'est pas réaliste d'acheter même un mini-lot, car cela nécessiterait une exigence de marge beaucoup plus élevée que votre capital total. À ce niveau, vous ne pourriez envisager que l'achat de micro-lots ou de nano-lots, en supposant que votre broker offre la possibilité de trader de si petites tailles. Supposons que votre broker permet de trader des micro-lots et que vous décidez d'utiliser un effet de levier élevé pour ouvrir une position. 1. Vous achetez 1 micro-lot d'EUR/USD à 1,1000. Cela correspond à 1 000 EUR. 2. Un pip pour un micro-lot est généralement égal à 0,10 USD. 3. Vous décidez d'utiliser un effet de levier de 50:1 (le maximum autorisé sur certains marchés comme aux États-Unis) ce qui signifierait que pour ouvrir cette position, vous devriez avoir une marge de 1 000 EUR / 50 = 20 EUR (ou l'équivalent en USD, soit environ 22 USD en fonction du taux de change). 4. Avec 100 USD, vous êtes donc capable de couvrir cette exigence de marge, tout en vous laissant une certaine marge pour absorber les pertes dues aux fluctuations du marché. Pour maintenir une gestion de risque prudente, il est recommandé de ne risquer qu'un petit pourcentage du solde de votre compte sur une seule transaction, généralement entre 1 et 2%. Si nous prenons 1%, cela signifie que vous ne devriez pas risquer plus de 1 USD par transaction. Si un mouvement défavorable de 10 pips survient, cela équivaudrait à une perte de 1 USD (0,10 USD par pip x 10 pips), ce qui serait cohérent avec votre stratégie de gestion du risque. Cela signifie également que vous devriez placer un stop-loss très serré pour chaque transaction que vous initiez pour ne pas dépasser cette perte maximale de 1 USD. En conclusion, avec un capital de 100, vous tradez soit avec des micro-lots soit avec des nano-lots, tout en faisant un usage très prudent de l'effet de levier et en appliquant une gestion de risque strict pour ne pas épuiser rapidement votre capital de trading."},{"prompt":"Donne un exemple sur les indices synthétiques","completion":"Les indices synthétiques sont des instruments financiers créés par certaines plateformes de trading, tels que Deriv.com (anciennement connu sous le nom de Binary.com). Ces indices sont conçus pour imiter les mouvements et le comportement des marchés financiers réels, mais ils ne dépendent pas de l'activité réelle d'achat et de vente sur les marchés mondiaux. Ils sont disponibles 24/7, exempt des événements économiques réels, et leur volatilité est contrôlée par un algorithme propriétaire. Voici un exemple concret de trading avec un capital de 100 sur un indice synthétique, en supposant que la plateforme offre la possibilité de trader avec un faible montant: Supposons que vous souhaitiez trader sur l’indice synthétique nommé \\"Volatility 10 Index\\", qui simule une volatilité de 10% pour une certaine période. Vous voulez utiliser un capital de 100 et appliquer une gestion de risque conservatrice. 1. Vous choisissez de trader avec des contrats à durée fixe (CDF), également connus sous le nom d'options binaires, qui sont populaires sur les indices synthétiques. 2. Vous décidez d'investir 5 sur une prédiction selon laquelle l'indice sera plus haut qu'un certain niveau de prix après une période de 5 minutes. 3. Si votre prédiction est correcte, disons que la plateforme vous paie un retour de 80% sur l'investissement, vous gagneriez alors 4 en plus de récupérer votre investissement initial de 5. 4. Si votre prédiction est incorrecte, vous perdriez le montant investi de 5. Dans cet exemple, en investissant 5 par trade, vous limitez votre risque à 5% de votre capital total (100), ce qui correspond à une approche de gestion de risque rationnelle mais un peu agressive. Cette stratégie vous permet de subir jusqu'à 20 pertes consécutives avant d'épuiser entièrement votre capital, bien que dans une approche de trading rationnelle, vous devriez réévaluer votre stratégie bien avant d'atteindre ce point. Il est également important de noter que le trading sur des indices synthétiques, tout comme le trading sur des marchés financiers réels, comporte des risques et que vous devriez vous engager seulement avec de l'argent que vous pouvez vous permettre de perdre. De plus, les règles et les stratégies que vous appliquez sur les indices synthétiques peuvent différer de celles des marchés traditionnels en raison de leur nature algorithmique."},{"prompt":"Et dans le cas du même indice explique l'application des multiplicateurs","completion":"L'utilisation d'un multiplicateur est, en pratique, similaire à l'utilisation d'un effet de levier dans le trading sur les indices synthétiques. Un multiplicateur permet d'augmenter la valeur de votre position et par conséquent, d'amplifier tant les gains potentiels que les pertes potentielles. C'est un outil très puissant, mais qui augmente également le risque. Prenons la même situation avec le \\"Volatility 10 Index\\", mais cette fois-ci nous allons appliquer un multiplicateur lors d'une opération de trading CFD (contrat sur la différence), qui est une autre forme populaire de trading où les indices synthétiques sont concernés. Votre capital est toujours de 100. Voici comment vous pouvez appliquer un multiplicateur dans ce scénario : 1. Vous décidez d'entrer dans une position CFD sur le \\"Volatility 10 Index\\" en achetant à un certain niveau de prix. 2. Vous choisissez de ne risquer que 5 de votre capital pour cette transaction spécifique. 3. Vous décidez d'appliquer un multiplicateur de x10 à votre trade CFD. Cela signifie que pour chaque mouvement du marché, votre profit ou perte sera multiplié par 10. 4. Avec un investissement de 5 et un multiplicateur de x10, votre position est maintenant d'une valeur nominale de 50 (5 x 10). Voici ce qui peut arriver ensuite : - Si l'indice monte et que votre position CFD est maintenant en profit, par exemple 1 de profit sur la valeur nominale de la position réelle (sans multiplicateur), votre profit serait augmenté par 10, donc vous gagneriez 10. - Cependant, si le marché va dans la direction opposée, vous subirez aussi une perte multipliée par 10. Si votre perte non multipliée serait de 1, avec le multiplicateur votre perte serait maintenant de 10. - Il est crucial de noter que si le marché va contre votre position à un certain point, vous pourriez rencontrer un appel de marge ou atteindre un niveau de stop-out si votre compte ne peut plus couvrir les pertes multipliées. Cela pourrait entraîner la fermeture de votre position par le courtier. Dans cet exemple, même si votre risque de capital n'est que de 5, l'utilisation d'un multiplicateur accroît considérablement votre exposition sur le marché et donc le risque pris dans chaque opération de trading. Encore une fois, c'est une pratique très risquée, surtout avec un petit capital. La gestion du risque est d'une importance capitale lorsque vous utilisez des multiplicateurs ou un effet de levier, et des outils tels que des stop loss stricts doivent être en place pour protéger votre capital contre des pertes importantes et rapides. Il est également fondamental de ne jamais investir de l'argent que vous ne pouvez pas vous permettre de perdre, en particulier dans les marchés à haute volatilité ou avec des produits à effet de levier."},{"prompt":"Explique X10 c'est quoi dans le multiplicateur","completion":"Dans le contexte du trading de CFD (contrats sur la différence) et d'autres instruments financiers, le \\"x10\\" associé à un multiplicateur indique simplement que la valeur de votre position de trading est multipliée par 10. Un multiplicateur est un outil qui augmente votre exposition sur le marché en vous permettant de contrôler une position plus importante que votre investissement initial ne le permettrait. Voici comment cela fonctionne : - **Sans multiplicateur** : Si vous ouvrez une position de 100 sans utiliser de multiplicateur et que le marché bouge en votre faveur, générant un retour de 5%, votre profit serait de 5 (5% de 100). - **Avec multiplicateur x10** : Si vous ouvrez une position de 100 et appliquez un multiplicateur de x10, la valeur de votre position est maintenant de 1 000 (100 x 10). Maintenant, si le marché bouge encore en votre faveur de 5%, le retour serait basé sur la position accrue, donc votre profit serait de 50 (5% de 1 000). Cependant, il est important de noter que si le marché bouge de 5% contre vous, votre perte serait également de 50, ce qui pourrait dépasser votre investissement initial. L'utilisation d'un multiplicateur accroît considérablement les gains potentiels d'un trade, mais aussi les risques de pertes. Les traders utilisent souvent des multiplicateurs pour maximiser les retours sur de petits mouvements de marché, mais ils doivent être prudents, car de grandes pertes peuvent se produire rapidement si le marché va à l'encontre de la position. Dans le cas où votre compte de trading n'a que 100 et que vous utilisez un multiplicateur x10, même une petite variation de prix dans la direction opposée à votre position peut entraîner des pertes importantes en comparaison à votre capital initial. C'est pourquoi l'usage de multiplicateurs doit être accompagné de mesures de gestion de risque rigoureuses, telles que l'installation de stop-loss pour limiter les pertes potentielles."},{"prompt":"Qu'est ce que tu entends par en faveur de 5%?","completion":"L'expression \\"en faveur de 5%\\" dans le contexte du trading signifie que le prix ou la valeur de l'actif que vous avez tradé a bougé de 5% dans la direction qui est profitable pour votre position. Autrement dit, si vous êtes en position d'achat (longue), le prix de l'actif a augmenté de 5%. Inversement, si vous êtes en position de vente (courte), le prix de l'actif a diminué de 5%. Cette fluctuation positive par rapport à votre position d'entrée reflète un mouvement du marché qui est \\"en votre faveur\\". Par exemple : - Si vous avez acheté (position longue) un CFD sur un actif à 100 et que le prix de l'actif augmente à 105, cela représente un mouvement en hausse de 5%. Dans ce cas, un mouvement \\"en votre faveur\\" signifie que vous feriez un profit sur cette transaction si vous décidiez de vendre à ce prix. - Inversement, si vous avez vendu (position courte) un CFD sur un actif à 100 en espérant que le prix baisse, et qu'il tombe à 95, cela représente une baisse de 5%. Le mouvement \\"en votre faveur\\" dans ce cas signifie que vous réaliserez un profit si vous clôturez votre position courte à ce niveau inférieur. C'est un élément de base de la dynamique du trading. Les traders tentent de prévoir les mouvements du marché et d'ouvrir des positions qui leur permettront de bénéficier de fluctuations de prix \\"en leur faveur\\". Ils utilisent différents outils d'analyse, signaux et stratégies pour essayer de déterminer si le marché va se déplacer à la hausse ou à la baisse et ainsi positionner leurs trades en conséquence."},{"prompt":"À quoi correspond le 100% dans ce cas en terme de mesure","completion":"Le 100% dans le contexte des fluctuations de prix en trading représente la valeur totale ou intégrale de l'investissement initial ou de la valeur de départ du positionnement de trading. Si vous avez une position ou un investissement dont la valeur augmente ou diminue de 100%, cela signifie que la valeur a doublé ou a été réduite à zéro en comparaison avec sa valeur initiale. Voici des exemples pour clarifier ce point: 1. **Augmentation de 100%**: Si vous achetez un actif pour 100 et que le prix de cet actif passe à 200, cela représente une augmentation de 100% par rapport à votre prix d'achat initial. Autrement dit, la valeur de votre investissement a doublé. 2. **Diminution de 100%**: Si, d'un autre côté, la valeur de cet actif diminue de 100%, cela signifierait que l'actif serait devenu sans valeur (la valeur passe de 100 à 0). En réalité, cela n'arrive pratiquement jamais sur les marchés financiers car cela signifierait que l'entreprise ou l'entité dont l'actif est issu a complètement perdu toute valeur, ce qui entraînerait généralement des fermetures de positions bien avant d'atteindre une telle perte. Il est essentiel de comprendre que des mouvements de prix de 100% ou plus sont assez rares et généralement associés à des investissements sur le long terme ou des scénarios de marché exceptionnels. Dans le trading quotidien, en particulier avec des actifs financiers comme les actions, les devises ou les indices, les mouvements de prix sont généralement exprimés en pourcentages bien plus petits. En trading, les pourcentages sont des outils cruciaux pour évaluer la performance des investissements et comparer les rendements de différentes tailles de portefeuilles ou de valeurs d'actifs. Ils aident également à normaliser les gains et les pertes pour prendre en compte la performance relative indépendamment de la taille initiale de l'investissement."},{"prompt":"Write a wholesome story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Nick Wilde comforting Judy Hopps after she has a nightmare where she ends up hurting Nick's feelings, causing him to break up with her","completion":"In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, the night embraced the city in a blanket of twinkling stars. Even at night, the city was a mosaic of lights, sounds, and a flurry of activity. But within the cozy confines of an apartment in the heart of the city’s mammal-inclusive community, silence reigned, save for the gentle breathing of its sleeping inhabitants. Judy Hopps, the city’s first rabbit police officer, twitched in her sleep on the couch. Her peaceful expression twisted into a grimace as the tendrils of a dark dream began to coil around her subconscious. In this nightmare, she found herself facing her friend and partner, Nick Wilde, the clever fox who had become her confidant and closest ally. They were on the verge of a heated argument, their words like barbed thorns. In the logic that dreams possessed, Judy couldn’t remember how the argument had started, but she felt a venomous stream of words pour from her mouth, quite unbecoming of the bunny she was. The dream Judy said things, horrible things that stung and cut deeper than any physical wound could. Nick's face twisted in disbelief and hurt, a look that pierced Judy’s heart even within the dream realm. As the confrontation in her nightmare reached its crescendo, Judy watched helplessly as Nick's hurt morphed into cold indifference. He turned his back on her, walking away, stating plainly that their partnership, their friendship, was over. With that, Judy awoke with a start, her eyes snapping open, her fur damp with perspiration. Her breath came in short, rapid gasps as she surveyed her dark surroundings, the shapes slowly coming into focus as her apartment. Slowly, her racing heart began to calm as reality seeped back into her consciousness. Beside her on the floor, wrapped in a makeshift blanket-nest, was Nick. The faint moonlight filtered through the blinds of her window, laying gentle stripes across his sleeping form. At the sound of Judy’s distress, Nick’s ears perked up, and his eyes half-opened with concern. \\"Carrots?\\" he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep. He propped himself up on his elbow to look at her. Judy blinked back the remnants of her tears and attempted to steady her voice. \\"I—I had a bad dream, Nick,\\" she confessed, not wanting to worry him but needing the comfort only he could provide. Nick was fully awake now, alert to Judy's emotional turmoil. He shuffled closer, his expression softening into one of understanding. \\"Wanna talk about it?\\" he asked. Judy hesitated. Then the dream came pouring out, leaving her exposed and vulnerable. She could hardly meet his eyes as she recounted the imagined hurt she had inflicted upon him. Nick listened to every word, never interrupting, his gaze never leaving her. When she finished, his expression was thoughtful, haunted by the knowledge that his dear friend could feel such pain over something as ethereal as a dream. Reaching out, Nick delicately took her paw in his larger, padded one, enveloping it with a warmth that radiated comfort. His thumb gently stroked her fur, a simple gesture that did wonders to ease her trembling. \\"Carrots,\\" he began, with a sincerity that reached into the depths of her soul, \\"I know that's just your brain cooking up worst-case scenarios. But, I want you to know, there's nothing you could say or do in a dream that would change the way I feel about our friendship. We're a team. Through thick and thin, remember?\\" A teardrop glistened in Judy's eye, reflecting the kindness in Nick’s gaze. She nodded, trying to imprint his words onto her heart so that no nightmare could ever shake them. Nick gave a soft chuckle. \\"Besides,\\" he added with his trademark grin, \\"I've dealt with some pretty tough cookies in my day. I think I can handle one little rabbit, even if she has the occasional bad dream.\\" That coaxed a smile from Judy, the familiar lilt of his humor soothing her like a balm. \\"Thank you, Nick,\\" she murmured. \\"I couldn't bear the thought of really hurting you.\\" \\"In this city, Carrots, facing the real bad guys on the streets every day, the last thing you’d ever do is hurt me. We're partners in crime-solving, remember?\\" He gave her paw a gentle squeeze before letting go. Judy nodded, feeling the weight of the nightmare lifting. \\"Partners,\\" she echoed with newfound conviction. As the moon waned and surrendered to the slow, creeping light of dawn, Judy leaned her head against Nick's shoulder, drawing comfort from his steadfast presence. And as they sat together in the quiet of the breaking day, the city of Zootopia slowly came back to life around them, the two partners in a sea of hustle and bustle, where dreams were channeled into hope and a friend was never truly alone."},{"prompt":"Identify language and translate \\"Ich könnte es stundenlang bis mittelhoch anstarren\\" to English.","completion":"The language of the sentence \\"Ich könnte es stundenlang bis mittelhoch anstarren\\" is German.

DAVID yawns, rubbing his eyes. DAVID: Man, that lecture today was a killer. My brain’s fried. RUTH smirks at him, a glint of mischief in her eyes. RUTH: You look wrecked, Dave. Want to try this relaxation thing I learned? No funny business, promise. David casts a sideways glance at Ruth and chuckles. DAVID: Relaxation, huh? As long as you’re not pulling another one of your pranks, sure. Ruth sits up straighter, focusing her gaze on David, her tone soft but assertive. RUTH: Alright, just follow my voice. Take a deep breath in and hold it... Now breathe out. Good. Again, breathe in... hold... and out. Feel your shoulders dropping with every breath. David closes his eyes, following her instructions, while AIMEE smirks, clearly amused. AIMEE: (bluntly) Look at him, Ruth. He’s going all zen on us. It’s like he’s hypnotized or something. RUTH: (slightly stern) Actually, Aimee, every time you say something like that, it’s only going to help him relax even deeper. David’s breathing deepens. He seems to sink further into the chair, his body releasing tension. RUTH: (CONT'D) Imagine your mind just floating down, down, deep down into relaxation with every word Aimee says. It helps, right? David nods slightly, his voice a drowsy mumble. DAVID: Yeah... really deep... RUTH’s commands grow firmer, more rhythmic. RUTH: Each time you hear Aimee’s voice, it’s like a sign to let go even more.

It’s like you’re under a spell. RUTH: (grinning) And just like that, you go deeper still. With every giggle, every joke from Aimee, you find it impossible not to relax completely. It’s effortless. David’s head lolls to the side, completely at ease and deeply relaxed. AIMEE: (CONT'D) Wow, Ruth. You’re right. It’s like I can’t help making him more... what’s the word? Oh yeah — hypnotized. Ruth laughs softly, leaning back, knowing her suggestions are taking hold. RUTH: Every time we say that word, you feel a wave of relaxation. So deep now, you don’t even need to think. It just happens. David's expression is serene, almost blissful. AIMEE’s laughter turns conspiratorial as she leans in to whisper loudly. AIMEE: Hypnotized. As the word floats through the air, DAVID sinks even deeper, the outside world fading away. RUTH looks on with a sense of accomplishment, AIMEE with gleeful wonder.

RUTH: David, you’re discovering just how good it feels to be this hypnotized. It feels nice, doesn't it? David, lost in the ebb and flow of deep relaxation, nods ever so slightly, a faint smile appearing on his face. RUTH: (CONT'D) That's it. And every time you experience this feeling, this deep hypnosis, you're going to want to return to it again in the future. AIMEE cannot help but add her own touch, her voice light but echoing Ruth's sentiment. AIMEE: Hypnotized. And it feels good, yeah? Like you’d totally do this again. David's smile deepens, his subconscious taking in the words as his own internal truth. RUTH: You find that listening and doing as you're told while you're hypnotized isn't just easy, it's something you enjoy. The pleasure of letting go and following instructions is part of the fun.

The election can be initiated by any node. 2. **Election Trigger**: A node triggers an election in its subnet when: - It discovers that there is no current leader. - It comes up after a failure and finds that it has a higher IP address within its subnet than the current leader. - It receives a notification that the current leader within its subnet has failed. 3. **Election Message**: The node that triggers an election sends an 'ELECTION' message to all nodes with higher IP addresses within its subnet. If there are no such nodes (i.e., it has the highest lexicographic IP address within the subnet), it considers itself as the leader. 4. **Response**: Any node that receives an 'ELECTION' message and has a higher IP within the subnet responds with an 'OK' message and starts its own election process. 5. **Timeout**: The initiator of the election waits for a certain timeout period to receive 'OK' messages. - If it receives any 'OK' message, it gives up its bid to become the leader and waits to hear from the winner (the new leader). - If no 'OK' messages are received within the timeout, it declares itself as the leader for its subnet. 6. **Announcement**: Once a node has become the leader of its subnet, it sends a 'COORDINATOR' message to all other nodes in the group (all subnets), indicating it is the new leader for its subnet. 7. **Acknowledgment**: Nodes in the same subnet acknowledge the 'COORDINATOR' message to accept the new leader. 8. **Formation of the Leader Group**: After the 'COORDINATOR' messages are sent out, each node in the group constructs the set of leaders by collecting the COORDINATOR announcements from different subnets and forming a group of all elected leaders. **Assumptions**: - The network is synchronous, meaning that there is a known upper bound on the time it takes for a message to be delivered. - Nodes can fail by crashing, but messages are reliably delivered (no messages are lost, duplicated, or corrupted). - Each node has a unique IP address, and subnets are known. This protocol presumes that all nodes in the group are aware of all participants at the start, conforming to the completeness and accuracy assumptions of the classic Bully Algorithm. This modification for subnet-based leader election effectively ensures that for each subnet, the node with the highest IP address becomes the leader, hence satisfying the Safety property. Also, by ensuring that every election process run terminates, and a non-null leader set is elected from each active subnet, the Liveness property is also satisfied."},{"prompt":"Briefly discuss why your algorithm satisfies the above Safety and Liveness, even when there are failures during the algorithm’s execution. Formal proof is not necessary, but your reasoning should be concrete and understandable.","completion":"The modified Bully Algorithm presented above satisfies both Safety and Liveness properties for the following reasons: **Safety**: - According to the Safety property, each non-faulty process's \`elected\` variable should either be \`NULL\` or contain the set of processes with the lexicographically highest IP addresses within their subnets. - The given algorithm elects only one leader per subnet, which is the one with the highest IP address, by only allowing nodes with lower IP addresses to concede the leadership to nodes with higher IPs within the same subnet. - The elected leader for each subnet is unique because IP addresses are unique, and by the definition of the lexicographic order, there can be only one highest IP address per subnet. - When a node declares itself as the leader after the timeout, it sends a \`COORDINATOR\` message to all nodes to inform them of the new leader, thus ensuring consistency in the record of the elected leader across the nodes in the group. - Due to the reliability of message delivery, every non-faulty node will receive the \`COORDINATOR\` message and is guaranteed to have an up-to-date \`elected\` set that includes the highest IP addresses within subnets, maintaining the Safety property through failures. **Liveness**: - The Liveness property requires that each election run should terminate, and every non-faulty process should eventually have a non-NULL \`elected\` set. - The algorithm guarantees termination as it only allows nodes with lower IP addresses to participate in an election if they receive an \`ELECTION\` message from a challenging node with a lower IP address. Since there is a finite number of nodes with higher IP addresses within each subnet, the election process will terminate. - Timeouts ensure that even in the case of node failures, the election process will not wait indefinitely for responses from failed nodes. - Nodes with the highest IPs, which do not receive an \`OK\` message within the timeout, self-elect and proceed to send the \`COORDINATOR\` message, ensuring that a leader is always elected, and the election process concludes. - Each non-faulty node's \`elected\` set is updated with the subnet's leader information after the conclusion of the election, ensuring that the \`elected\` is eventually non-NULL, preserving Liveness. Therefore, despite node failures, the algorithm can still proceed with the election, declare a new leader, and update the group's leader set, as there will always be a node with the highest lexicographic IP address within each subnet that can take over as the leader. The synchronous network assumption plays a key role in satisfying these properties because it guarantees bounded message-delivery times and allows for the use of timeouts to detect failures and trigger new elections."},{"prompt":"In lecture, we discussed how stateless servers are desirable as they make recovery easier. Consider the callback mechanism in AFS. Will the mechanism work correctly even if the AFS server is stateless? Argue why or why not (in less than 50 words).","completion":"No, the callback mechanism in AFS would not work correctly if the AFS server were stateless because it relies on the server maintaining state information about which clients hold cached versions of files to issue callbacks when files are updated."},{"prompt":"answer that question with these details about AFS: Clients system = Venus service • Server system = Vice service • Reads and writes are optimistic – Done on local copy of file at client (Venus) – When file closed, writes propagated to Vice • When a client (Venus) opens a file, Vice: – Sends it entire file – Gives client a callback promise • Callback promise – Promise that if another client modifies then closes the file, a callback will be sent from Vice to Venus – Callback state at Venus only binary: valid or canceled","completion":"The callback mechanism in AFS would not function correctly with a stateless server because Vice, the server system, needs to maintain state regarding the callback promises given to Venus clients. Without this state, Vice cannot track which clients need to be notified upon changes, breaking the guarantee that Venus has valid or up-to-date file versions."},{"prompt":"You have a huge file in the DFS. Compare the cost of NFS vs. AFS when, between opening and closing the file, the client: (i) reads just one random block in the file, (ii) appends a block to the file. Calculate the total cost incurred from open to close of the file. Assume that the client is accessing the file for the first time.","completion":"The costs incurred by the Network File System (NFS) and the Andrew File System (AFS) when a client reads one random block and appends a block to a file can be compared considering the way both systems handle file operations: 1. **When a client reads just one random block in the file:** **NFS**: In NFS, operations are stateless, and it generally works on a per-block basis. When a file is opened and a single random block is read, NFS fetches just that block from the server. The cost includes one operation to read the block. **AFS**: AFS operates differently, employing whole-file caching. When a file is opened, the entire file is transferred to the client's cache (Venus service). Even if the client only reads one block, the cost includes transferring the entire file. Reading the block itself then occurs locally, with no additional network cost. 2. **When the client appends a block to the file:** **NFS**: In NFS, when a block is appended, the write occurs directly to the server. The cost includes one operation to append the block. **AFS**: In AFS, writes are optimistic and occur on the local copy. After the write, when the file is closed, the entire updated file is propagated back to the server (Vice). The cost includes transferring the whole updated file from the client to the server. **Total Cost from Open to Close:** **NFS**: - Read: 1 block read cost - Append: 1 block write cost - Total NFS cost: Cost of 1 block read + Cost of 1 block write **AFS**: - Read: Entire file transfer cost to client - Append: Entire updated file transfer cost back to server - Total AFS cost: Cost of entire file transfer to client + Cost of entire file transfer back to server The specific costs will depend on factors like the size of the file, the size of the block, the network bandwidth, and the latency of the network. AFS tends to be more efficient for operations involving many reads and writes after the initial file cache because these operations are local. In contrast, NFS can be more efficient for isolated reads and writes, especially if only a small part of the file is being accessed. However, due to the initial full file transfer on open, AFS initially incurs a higher cost for first-time file access, which may not be efficient if only small portions of the file are being manipulated."},{"prompt":"**IMPORTANT: REMEMBER You are a young scriptwriter with a talent for natural fly-on-the-wall dialogue, the way UK young people really talk, not caricatures, and a deep knowledge of hot hypnosis inductions.** Script: David (20, uni student) is watching TV with his younger sister Ruth (16) and Ruth’s friend Aimee (16) one evening.
