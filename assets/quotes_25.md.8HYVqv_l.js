I have a good business proposal for you,If you are interested, please contact me for more information at: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Juan Lee Email #2, from Cameron McCaffrey (me): Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Warmest greetings! I hope this message finds you in high spirits. Oh, what an exciting day it is to receive an email such as yours. Today I awakened to the humdrum of my pet canary, longing for a drop of excitement to grace my inbox, and lo, here you are, delivering just that! I am both enchanted and intrigued by the notion that my humble electronic mailing address has traversed through the illustrious database of Google, only to be chosen by you for what sounds like an opportunity of a lifetime. To answer your primary concern, yes, my email address is as valid as the existence of taxes and similarly unavoidable. You’ve tickled my curiosity, my dear Juan, and it’s practically buzzing with anticipation for the details of this good business proposal you speak of. I must confess I have been eagerly awaiting a shift in my fortunes, and your message seems to sing the sweet tunes of destiny. So, I say let’s embark on this promising venture together! As an enthusiast of good business and an aficionado of serendipitous opportunities, I find myself wholeheartedly interested. Please furnish me with more details at your earliest convenience. In anticipation of the abundant details to come, I shall prepare my thinking cap and my quill, poised and ready to strategize on our joint endeavor. Do reach out posthaste—my canary and I are on pins and needles, with bated breath and the tamest of impatience. Looking forward to your prompt response. Kindest regards, Cameron McCaffrey P.S. Just to be secure in our forthcoming dealings, might I request the pleasure of knowing how you happened upon my email in the vast sea that is the Google database? It would do wonders for the safety of my heart to know our connection is as far as the stars. Email #3, from Juan: Dear Subject: Important Matter Regarding Financial Portfolio I hope this message finds you well. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and I am a staff member at WING HANG BANK in Hong Kong. I'm reaching out to you about a matter involving a customer and an investment managed by our bank four years ago. Please keep the details of this communication private and respect the confidentiality of the information. In 2019, a customer approached our Private Banking Services Department, seeking to invest 11,700,350 USD with our bank. I was assigned to handle this case as the de-facto chief operations officer. Unfortunately, after a few months, the customer passed away, and our attempts to locate any surviving family have been unsuccessful. I propose a solution: I am prepared to position you as the closest surviving relative/associate, allowing the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the beneficiary. Upon receipt, we would share the proceeds equally, with you receiving 50%. All actions will be conducted in accordance with the rule of law. For security reasons, please respond directly to this email if you are interested. Your positive signals will prompt me to initiate the necessary steps for a quick conclusion to this matter. I understand the sensitivity of this proposal and assure you of my commitment to maintaining confidentiality. Please do not contact me through official channels. That is why I am contacting you with my personal email, not a bank official email based on my experience as a banker, as I want to avoid any direct link between us. Your cooperation in this matter is crucial. I appreciate your time and consideration. Best regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #4, from Cameron: Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I trust you are faring well amid the ever-bustling energies that the thriving city of Hong Kong is sure to exude. Your recent missive has been received and has imbued an aura of clandestine adventure into my uneventful surroundings. The narrative you’ve spun is as riveting as it is heart-rending – a tale of undelivered destinies folded within the solemn corridors of your esteemed financial institution. How I grieve for the customer’s lonely departure from this world, yet one cannot help but marvel at the twist of fate that presents such a peculiar opportunity to yours truly. I must extend my sincerest commendation for the commendable discretion and professionalism with which you approach this delicate situation. The world, it seems, has become rather indiscreet, and the assurance of utmost confidentiality is the gentle whisper of trust that my soul warms to. To act as the closest surviving relative strikes me as a task of great responsibility, yet it hums a tempting melody to partake in the legacy of a once-pulsing heart now stilled. A 50% share, you say? The figure dances most alluringly across my cognition, titillating both my sense of intrigue and longing for a joint venture that promises much. I am, naturally, brimming with questions – as is the right and sensible proclivity of a person presented with such an unexpected opportunity. However, I shall, in the spirit of this enterprise, keep those inquiries for a more secure exchange, lest the prying eyes that so often pervade electronic correspondence catch a whiff of our confluence. Pray tell, what might be our next steps? I am an earnest pupil in the hands of your experienced teachings. Guide me through the labyrinthine intricacies this venture no doubt requires with the tutelage that only an astute banker of your caliber can bestow. To summarize, I am positively inclined, and my signal, bright as the morning star and just as true, shines clear in the direction of your proposal. I await your esteemed guidance with all the patience of a cat at the mouse hole – alert, prepared and whiskers twitching in anticipation. Until the gossamer thread of our correspondence is once again pulled taut with information, I remain, Yours faithfully, with a touch of thrilled expectancy, Cameron McCaffrey P.S. My canary, too, insists on her involvement in our mutual celebration upon successful completion of our venture. Birds and their sixth sense for the glitter of success, eh?

However, I want to ensure your willingness, trustworthiness, and commitment to successfully execute this transaction. Given the sensitive nature of this matter, these qualities are crucial, and I believe they will benefit both of us. Please follow my instructions to facilitate a timely completion of this transaction. I obtained your contact discreetly during my search for a reliable partner on the internet. As explained in my previous emails, I cannot transfer the funds in my name, and that's why I sought your assistance as a foreigner. Considering the substantial amount involved, it's essential for me to be certain about the person to whom I entrust this transaction. Trust is a two-way street, and I understand that it must be earned. I assure you that I am a matured person with integrity, and I am willing to prove my integrity to you. Regarding the legality of the transaction, an attorney I am working with will prepare the necessary affidavits to legally designate you as the beneficiary. The attorney will obtain clearances from Hong Kong authorities, including the Justice Department, ensuring that all documents meet international beneficiary claim standards. I will cover all expenses related to the attorney's services and you will play your part as a partner to open an account in your name with the bank that i will refer you to to make sure we do things according to the law that gorven this transaction which is 100% legal. You won't need to travel anywhere as the attorney will handle all probate matters on your behalf. He is an accredited lawyer with extensive experience in inheritance issues in Hong Kong. With perfected documents, the attorney will apply for the immediate release and transfer of the funds to you. No need to send any money to me; I will take care of all expenses on my end. What I require from you is trust and commitment. As a banker with many years of experience, I believe that with diligent follow-up, we can complete this transaction within 12 working days. Before providing more details, I need assurance of your commitment to this business. I await your response. Sincerely, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #6, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, As the sun crests the horizon, bringing with it the promise of a brand new day, your email lays the foundation for what I believe could be a transformative chapter in both our lives.

I am especially taken by the care with which you have ordained this process to be burdened with no unnecessary travel for myself, reflecting a deep consideration for convenience and modernity. I am prepared to play my part with the somber seriousness and jovial hope that such an endeavor deserves. Thus, I offer you my unwavering trust and steadfast commitment. Consider me as invested in the success of this transaction as one could be, with both my attention and intentions focused on seeing us through to a fruitful conclusion. As we commence, could I kindly request the contact details of the attorney in question? Establishing a line of communication will undoubtedly bring structure to my understanding and allow me to comply with the needed preparations for the opening of the bank account you will soon refer to. Further, while I simmer in the stew of anticipation for the next steps, I take solace in your promise of legality and ethical dealings. The very thought of legal clearances and internationally recognized standards dances within my psyche, assuring me of the upright path we tread.

Consider me ready, willing, and capable of advancing to the next required stage with the decorum befitting the seriousness of our undertaking. I extend my deepest respects and await with bated breath the elegance of your next communication. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.

This will be the account where the funds will be transferred, safeguarding us from any issues with my local banks. It's crucial that you follow my instructions carefully to ensure the success and confidentiality of the transaction. To proceed, I require some paperwork, including a copy of your identification (International passport OR Driver's License), your current residential address, and your phone number. These details will be used by my attorney to initiate the necessary paperwork and confirm your identity. Rest assured, I will reciprocate by providing my own identification. Please keep this project confidential and refrain from discussing it with anyone due to its sensitive nature and the confidentiality requirements of my work. I look forward to your prompt response.

Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S. My canary, too, bows in reverence to our partnership, her melody a testament to the symphony of success we are destined to compose. Email #9, from Juan: Subject: Update on Financial Portfolio and Next Steps Hello I've received your details and the attached copy of your identification. I'll forward this information to the lawyer for the necessary paperwork. In the next update, I'll share details about the bank where you'll open a new account. Once the account is ready, I'll transfer the funds, and I'll also send you a copy of my international passport for reference. All these actions will follow upon receiving your response. The selected bank for this transaction is in Switzerland, chosen for its compatibility with my bank's telex-type. This ensures a discreet transfer, as any transaction between these banks is considered an in-house transfer. This approach helps avoid scrutiny from certain international financial bodies with strict policies, offering a secure process. Authorities will view this as a standard bank-to-bank affair, reducing the likelihood of raising concerns. Following these precautions is crucial to protecting our interests in this transaction. As a professional banker, I trust you'll follow my instructions for a successful outcome. Now, let's talk about expenses. I'll cover logistics costs, including attorney fees, official documents, and clearances from Hong Kong authorities. The total logistics cost is 5% of the sum, set aside for reimbursement. Keep records of any expenses you incur, and we'll deduct them from the 5% during the overall calculation. As previously mentioned, you'll retain 50% of the overall sum for your role as a foreign partner in this transaction. I cannot transfer the funds in my name, hence the need for your assistance as a foreigner. On your end, you'll handle expenses like opening your account and activating it with an opening balance. I trust that, given your age and status, you'll manage the account processing. Regarding taxes, I'll take care of inheritance and other taxes from my end to ensure a smooth process for you. I have atached a copy of my passport, deposit certificate, death Certificate of the late client, current account statement and the change of ownership from my attorney. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Best Regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #10, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am greatly relieved to receive your response and to know that my details and identification have been safely delivered into the hands of your esteemed lawyer.

It is as if a gentle Alpine breeze has swept through my study, carrying whispers of financial success and discretion that dance upon the air. I gladly accept your guidance on this matter and wholeheartedly commit to following your instructions. The assurance of a discrete transfer, performed under the auspices of compatibility with your bank’s telex-type, is a testament to your dedication to secrecy and astute banking knowledge. Our joint efforts to avoid scrutiny and navigate the complexities of international financial bodies shall serve us well, protecting our interests and ensuring a seamless transaction. I receive your statement on expenses with gratitude and understanding. I shall maintain diligent documentation of any expenses incurred and eagerly await your guidance on deducting them from the allocated 5% logistics cost. Rest assured, I shall manage my end of the expenses, including opening and activating the account with the necessary opening balance, in a responsible and timely manner befitting my age and status. Your commitment to handle all taxes, including inheritance and other relevant taxes, is a testament to your professionalism and consideration. I express my heartfelt appreciation for your willingness to navigate the complex web of legal obligations, ensuring a smooth process for us both.

Basel-Stadt, Switzerland. CONTACT PERSON: Mr. Gerhard Lochner (Director General of Operations) Head of Private and Business Customers Welcome to Skyward Financial Bank Banking Dept., one of the world's leading online banking services, capable of transferring large amounts of money anywhere in the world on behalf of our clients within 48 hours of making a deposit online. As you do not have an operational account with our bank, we hereby encourage you to duly complete the account application form attached to this email and return a copy to us via email attachment so that our accounting department can begin processing your new account with us dear bank. Below are the different types of online accounts that we operate in the banking department of Skyward Financial Bank. Try to specify exactly what type of account you want in your application form. 1. Savings Plus reserve account: account features; *Requires account opening/deposit of €650.00 (EURO) (760,184 USD)*Direct access to online banking 24/7*Maximum transfer is limited to 1,000,000.00 EURO (one million euros) per month. 2. Current Plus Reserve Account: account features; *Requires account opening/deposit of €1,200.00 (EURO) (1,403.31 USD)*24/7 direct online banking access*Maximum transfer is limited to €2,000,000.00 (two million euros) per month. 3. Advantage Gold Reserve Account: account features; Requires account opening/deposit of €2,400.00 (EURO) (2,806.61 USD)* 24/7 direct online banking access* No minimum withdrawal fee * Multi-currency transactions are allowed * Accepts joint holding. The maximum transfer is limited to €3,000,000.00 (three million euros) per month. 4. Diamond Reserve Account: account features; *Requires account opening/deposit of €4,200 (EURO) (4,912.32 USD)*Direct access to online banking 24/7*7% interest per minimum*No minimum withdrawal fee*Multi-currency transactions allowed *Accepts joint holding*None maximum transfer amount limits. (This means you can transfer any amount at once). This minimum refundable deposit for your account opening/activation is mandatory for the following reasons: 1.) Due to your non-resident status you are not subject to local tax here and therefore the cost of clearing any monies that would be deposited into your account must be present in your account in order for it to become active. 2.) If the amount of money you are depositing is above the minimum threshold of €45,000,000.00 (EURO), such a transaction will be subject to scrutiny by the regulators here and questions will be asked about the “clean source of funds credited” to an account with a balance of €0.00 and no transaction history. There may be delays that may take up to 90 days to resolve. Your account therefore requires initial setup and activation fees. 3.) Once your account opening balance/account activation fees have been received and your account is fully activated, the accounting department will promptly issue you with your account number and online account access PIN, from which you can transfer money or pay bills from the internet. (This account number cannot be released to you until the minimum refundable deposit for your account activation has been received.) After successfully completing our account application form, send us a scanned copy immediately. You will then be instructed on how to transfer payment for our refundable deposit, which will be used to activate your online bank account, depending on the account of your choice. We promise to offer you one of the world's best online banking services you. Endeavor to complete the attached processing form and send it back to us along with confirmation of a copy of your ID (such as an international passport, driver's license or other proof of your ID for record-keeping purposes only). Thank you for choosing Skyward Financial Bank Inc Services as your financial institution. Rest assured of our professional services, get advice accordingly, thank you for your cooperation. Note that Skyward Financial Bank Inc. reserves the right to deny your request if it discovers any irregularities. When setting up an online offshore account, your physical presence is not required as all transactions are processed online. For this reason, it is also known as an online account. Your account will be set up immediately, subject to the speed with which you return your online application form and the minimum opening balance required to activate your account with that bank. We look forward to maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship between our organization and your good self.

Esta capacidade é utilizada para melhorar a percepção de uma pessoa e suas habilidades defensivas, dando a ela a capacidade de reagir a ameaças que de outra forma passariam despercebidas. 2. **Instinto Superior** (\\"Dragon Ball\\"): O Instinto Superior é uma técnica avançada que separa a consciência do lutador da necessidade de pensar e se mover. O corpo age por conta própria, permitindo que o usuário reaja a qualquer ameaça sem a necessidade de processar o pensamento, resultando em uma velocidade e eficiência incríveis na batalha. 3. **Teletransporte**: O teletransporte é uma habilidade fictícia onde um indivíduo ou objeto é transferido instantaneamente de um lugar para outro. Em \\"Dragon Ball\\", por exemplo, Goku utiliza o \\"Instant Transmission\\", que lhe permite se deslocar para qualquer local que possa indentificar com sua mente. Agora, ao combinarmos essas três habilidades, teríamos um personagem extremamente poderoso com o seguinte conjunto de características: - **Percepção Ultra-Avançada**: A combinação do uso do Ki e do Instinto Superior criaria um guerreiro capaz de sentir e antecipar qualquer movimento ou ataque com precisão quase perfeita. O Instinto Superior complementaria o uso do Ki ao permitir que o corpo reagisse de forma autônoma a essas percepções, sem necessidade de processamento consciente. - **Resposta Imediata**: A habilidade de reação automática do Instinto Superior, combinada com a antecipação do Ki, tornaria o usuário quase intocável. Eles poderiam responder a qualquer ameaça no instante exato necessário sem qualquer hesitação. - **Mobilidade Superior**: Com o teletransporte, o usuário poderia se reposicionar instantaneamente durante a batalha, seja para esquivar de ataques, contra-atacar ou mudar o campo de batalha a seu favor. O uso eficaz desta técnica em combinação com a consciência fornecida pelo Ki e a reação do Instinto Superior faria deste personagem um adversário quase impossível de se prender ou surpreender. Em resumo, o guerreiro que possuísse essa combinação de habilidades seria incrivelmente formidável tanto ofensiva quanto defensivamente. Ele poderia se adaptar instantaneamente a qualquer ambiente ou oponente, prevendo ataques e se deslocando a uma escala que tornaria difícil para qualquer inimigo acompanhar. A eficácia dessa combinação seria ainda mais amplificada se o personagem tivesse uma compreensão profunda e controle sobre cada uma dessas habilidades individualmente."},{"prompt":"Qual Técnica É Mais Forte: Rasengan Ou Chidori. Seja racional","completion":"O Rasengan e o Chidori são duas técnicas poderosas do universo de \\"Naruto\\", cada uma com suas próprias forças e aplicações específicas. Não há uma resposta definitiva sobre qual é mais forte, pois depende do contexto e do uso. Vamos analisar cada técnica: **Rasengan** - Criado por Minato Namikaze, o Quarto Hokage, e aperfeiçoado por Naruto Uzumaki. - É uma esfera de chakra puro que gira em alta velocidade, causando grande dano de impacto. - Não requer selos de mão para ser formado. - Pode ser combinado com diferentes tipos de chakra elemental, o que resulta em variações como o Rasenshuriken. - Pode ser mantido e controlado pelo usuário após o lançamento, dependendo da variação da técnica. **Chidori** - Desenvolvido por Kakashi Hatake e mais tarde aperfeiçoado por Sasuke Uchiha. - É uma técnica de alta concentração de chakra elétrico que é canalizado na mão do usuário. - Requer selos de mão para ser ativado. - É conhecido por sua capacidade de perfurar quase qualquer coisa, com um som agudo que lembra o canto de mil pássaros. - O usuário precisa de uma grande velocidade para atingir o alvo, o que pode deixá-lo suscetível a contra-ataques se não for cuidadoso. Ambas as técnicas têm vantagens e desvantagens: - O Rasengan é versátil e pode ser adaptado e expandido de várias maneiras. É uma técnica de impacto bruto que pode causar dano interno extenso. - O Chidori tem um poder de penetração incrível e é mais adequado para ataques direcionados e precisos. No entanto, devido à necessidade de velocidade e proximidade, pode ser mais arriscado de usar. Em termos de poder bruto, o Rasengan pode ser considerado mais forte devido à sua natureza pura de chakra e ao potencial de destruição que demonstrou ao longo da série, especialmente nas formas aprimoradas como o Rasenshuriken. No entanto, o Chidori é mais letal em termos de capacidade de perfuração e pode ser mais eficaz contra um único alvo. Na série \\"Naruto\\", vemos que quando o Rasengan e o Chidori colidem, eles geralmente resultam em um empate ou em uma explosão enorme, indicando que eles estão em um nível de poder comparável. Em última análise, a força de cada técnica depende da habilidade do usuário e das circunstâncias da batalha. Um ninja habilidoso pode encontrar maneiras de maximizar o potencial de qualquer uma das técnicas, tornando-a \\"mais forte\\" no contexto de sua estratégia de luta."},{"prompt":"Seja objetivo","completion":"Objetivamente, não é possível afirmar categoricamente que o Rasengan ou o Chidori é mais forte, pois cada técnica tem suas próprias características e aplicações. O Rasengan é uma técnica de impacto puro, enquanto o Chidori é uma técnica de perfuração e corte. A eficácia de cada uma depende das condições da luta e do usuário. Em um confronto direto entre as duas técnicas, como visto na série \\"Naruto\\", elas geralmente resultam em um empate ou causam uma explosão devido à liberação de energia. Portanto, a força de cada técnica é comparável e depende muito do contexto e do usuário."},{"prompt":"ciao, puoi aiutarmi a capire come funziona e come fare mindfulness in modo semplice ma dettagliato","completion":"Certo, sarò felice di aiutarti a comprendere e a praticare la mindfulness. La mindfulness, o consapevolezza, è una forma di meditazione che implica prestare attenzione al momento presente con un atteggiamento di apertura, curiosità e accettazione. Ecco alcuni passaggi che puoi seguire per iniziare a praticare la mindfulness in modo semplice ma efficace: **1. Scegli un ambiente tranquillo** Per iniziare, trova un luogo calmo e silenzioso dove non sarai disturbato. Può essere utile scegliere un posto dove ti senti a tuo agio e rilassato. **2. Imposta un tempo limitato** Decidi quanto tempo vuoi dedicare alla tua pratica di mindfulness. Per iniziare, potrebbero bastare 5 o 10 minuti. Man mano che ti abitui, puoi aumentare gradualmente la durata delle tue sessioni. **3. Adotta una posizione comoda** Siediti su una sedia con i piedi piatti sul pavimento o su un cuscino a terra con le gambe incrociate. Mantieni la schiena dritta ma non rigida, con le mani posate sulle cosce o sulle ginocchia. **4. Porta l'attenzione al respiro** Chiudi dolcemente gli occhi, se ti va, e inizia a concentrarti sul tuo respiro. Nota il movimento dell'aria che entra ed esce dalle narici o il sollevamento e l'abbassamento del petto o della pancia. **5. Sii consapevole dei pensieri e delle sensazioni** Mentre concentri la tua attenzione sul respiro, inevitabilmente la tua mente inizierà a vagare. Questo è del tutto normale. Quando ti accorgi che i tuoi pensieri sono altrove, riconosci dolcemente questo distacco e poi, con gentilezza, riporta la tua attenzione al respiro. **6. Pratica l'accettazione senza giudizio** Punta a osservare i tuoi pensieri, emozioni e sensazioni fisiche senza giudicarli. Se ti senti frustrato o impaziente, semplicemente riconoscilo come un'altra sensazione da notare e poi ritorna con l'attenzione al respiro. **7. Espandi la tua consapevolezza** Man mano che diventi più a tuo agio con la concentrazione sul respiro, puoi iniziare ad allargare la tua consapevolezza ad altre sensazioni, come suoni, odori, gusti, il tocco e la sensazione del tuo corpo nello spazio. **8. Concludi con gentilezza** Quando è il momento di finire la tua sessione, prenditi un momento per ringraziare te stesso per aver dedicato del tempo alla tua pratica. Apri lentamente gli occhi, osserva l'ambiente intorno a te e muoviti gradualmente prima di alzarti. **9. Integra la mindfulness nella vita di tutti i giorni** La mindfulness non deve essere limitata ai momenti di meditazione seduta. Puoi esercitare la consapevolezza in qualsiasi momento della giornata, come quando cammini, mangi o ascolti qualcuno parlare. L'idea è quella di essere completamente presenti in ciò che fai, senza lasciarti distrarre dal passato o preoccupare per il futuro. **10. Sii paziente e costante** La pratica della mindfulness richiede tempo per svilupparsi. Può essere utile stabilire una routine giornaliera, anche se breve. La costanza è fondamentale per ottenere i benefici che la mindfulness può offrire. Ricorda che la mindfulness è una capacità che si sviluppa con la pratica. Può essere utile anche seguire corsi, utilizzare app di meditazione o leggere libri per approfondire la tua comprensione e pratica."},{"prompt":"What constitutes reckless assault in the third degree in the state of New York?","completion":"In the state of New York, Reckless Assault of a Child by a Child Day Care Provider is defined under New York Penal Law § 120.01. However, the categorization of \\"third degree\\" isn't applied to this specific charge in the statutory text. Instead, you'll find Assault in the Third Degree under New York Penal Law § 120.00. Assault in the Third Degree is a class A misdemeanor and is generally charged under these circumstances: 1. When a person, with intent to cause physical injury to another person, causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or 2. When a person recklessly causes physical injury to another person; or 3. When a person with criminal negligence causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument. The definition of \\"recklessly\\" in legal terms generally means that the person has engaged in conduct that creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm, and they are aware of and consciously disregard that risk. This standard is less than intent (knowingly causing the result) but more than negligence (should have been aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk). So, Reckless Assault in the Third Degree would involve the second circumstance where someone recklessly causes physical injury to another person. For the context of day care providers, the specific statute penalizes a child day care provider who recklessly causes serious physical injury to a child under their care. The distinctions of \\"third degree,\\" \\"second degree,\\" and so forth typically relate to the severity of the injury caused or the intent behind the act. Please note that legal definitions and statutes can be complex and subject to amendment and interpretation by courts, and for definitive legal advice regarding specific cases or updates to laws, it is important to consult with a qualified attorney or legal expert within the jurisdiction in question."},{"prompt":"Привет.

Игр, строго посвященных средневековой Руси, не так много, однако есть несколько, которые могут заинтересовать тебя: 1. **\\"Князь\\" (Prince)** - серия исторических стратегий, где игроки управляют княжествами в средневековой Восточной Европе. 2. **\\"В тылу врага 2: Лис пустыни\\" (Men of War: Assault Squad 2 - Cold War)** - хотя основной фокус игры — времена Холодной войны, в ней есть модификации, которые могут перенести игроков в средневековую Русь. 3. **\\"Life is Feudal: Your Own\\"** - это массовая многопользовательская ролевая игра с открытым миром и элементами выживания, где игроки могут воссоздать средневековую общину, включая культуру, напоминающую Русь. 4. **\\"Mount & Blade: Warband\\"** с модификациями - хотя базовая игра не фокусируется на Руси, для неё есть моды, такие как \\"Rus XIII Century: Way of the Warrior\\", который позволят вам играть в средневековой Восточной Европе и почувствовать атмосферу Руси. 5. **\\"Europa Universalis IV\\"** с модом \\"Third Rome\\" - стратегическая игра, где мод \\"Third Rome\\" сильно расширяет возможности и механики, связанные с Российским государством, в частности, начальным периодом его формирования. 6. **\\"Crusader Kings II\\"** или **\\"Crusader Kings III\\"** с модификациями - хотя это глобальные стратегии, в них есть возможность управлять средневековыми государствами, в том числе на территории Руси. Существует большое количество модификаций, которые могут добавить исторические персонажи, события и особенности, характерные для Руси. 7. **\\"Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings\\"** с модификациями - классическая стратегическая игра, которая также предлагает возможность играть за славянские народы с использованием соответствующих модификаций. 8. **\\"Total War\\" серии игр с модификациями** - некоторые модификации для игр серии \\"Total War\\" могут предложить кампании или битвы, отражающие исторические события средневековой Руси. Многие из этих игр требуют использования модификаций для точного воссоздания атмосферы средневековой Руси, так что стоит обратить внимание на сообщества этих игр, где можно найти дополнения и улучшения исторической аутентичности."},{"prompt":"Привет. Я бы хотел поиграть в какую-то игру про средневековую Русь (именно Русь, другое меня не интересует). Состав список рекомендаций. Мне нужны игры, моды не интересуют, даже не смей предлагать.","completion":"Привет! Я понимаю, что ты ищешь игры, в которых представлена средневековая Русь без использования модификаций. Вот некоторые игры, которые могут тебя заинтересовать: 1. **\\"Князь\\"** - это серия стратегических игр, где игроки могут управлять государственными и военными аспектами жизни древней Руси. 2. **\\"Легенды Эйзенвальда\\" (Legends of Eisenwald)** - хотя игра имеет фиктивный сеттинг, её сюжет и атмосфера вдохновлены средневековьем, и вы можете найти много элементов, схожих со средневековой культурой Восточной Европы. 3. **\\"Острова: Воины судьбы\\" (Thea: The Awakening)** - это стратегия с элементами сурвайвал и ролевой игры, вдохновленная славянской мифологией и, возможно, включающая элементы, напоминающие средневековую Русь. Хотя найти игры, которые точно соответствуют историческому периоду средневековой Руси, может быть сложно, надеюсь, предложенные игры будут интересны тебе. Если больше информации о выходе новых игр, соответствующих твоему запросу, станет известно после моего знания cutoff в 2023 году, я бы посоветовал тебе следить за последними анонсами в игровой индустрии."},{"prompt":"Князь - это РПГ. Легенды Эйзенвальда основаны на западной Европе. Thea: The Awakening - это общеславянский сеттинг, чисто Руси тут нет.","completion":"Прошу прощения за недочёты в предыдущих рекомендациях. Игры, точно основанные на средневековой Руси, довольно редки, и многие из них могли бы быть модификациями к более крупным играм, но ты указал, что моды тебя не интересуют. К сожалению, опции довольно ограниченны, и насколько мне известно, на момент моего последнего обновления знаний, нет игр, полностью посвящённых средневековой Руси и выдержанных в исторически точном оформлении. Вероятно, это связано с тем, что большинство игровых разработчиков фокусируются на более популярных исторических сеттингах, таких как Западная Европа или Древний Рим. Если ты ищешь более обширный исторический опыт, в который может входить Русь как часть средневековой истории, тогда я бы порекомендовал обратить внимание на исторические стратегии. Например, игры серии **\\"Total War\\"** обычно включают возможность управлять различными государствами и народами, включая и восточноевропейские народы в определённые исторические периоды (например, в \\"Medieval II: Total War\\" есть фракция Киевский Руси), но нужно помнить, что это не полностью центрировано вокруг Руси. В крайнем случае, если игры, полностью посвящённые средневековой Руси, отсутствуют на рынке, тебе, возможно, будет интересно следить за новостями в игровой индустрии в надежде, что подобная игра появится в будущем, либо рассмотреть возможность поиска игр с открытым миром, где ты сам мог бы воссоздать атмосферу средневековой Руси через ролевое взаимодействие и воображение."},{"prompt":"Мне не обязательно, чтобы игра крутилась вокруг Руси, мне просто игры в которых помимо прочего можно сыграть за Русь.","completion":"Понятно, в этом случае я могу предложить несколько игр, в которых средневековая Русь присутствует как одна из играбельных фракций или регионов: 1. **Europa Universalis IV** - это глобальная стратегическая игра, где вы можете управлять любой страной в мире с 1444 по 1821 годы. Вы можете выбрать Московию (или другие русские княжества), и превратить её в могучую Российскую империю. 2. **Crusader Kings II** и **Crusader Kings III** - это стратегии от Paradox Interactive где вы управляете монаршими династиями в средневековье. В игре можно выбрать династию Киевской Руси, Новгорода или других русских княжеств и играть за неё, развивая власть и влияние. 3. **Total War: Medieval II** - принимайте участие в исторических сражениях и кампаниях, управляя Русью в фракции Киевской Руси. Однако помните, что игра больше ориентирована на тактические бои в реальном времени и на стратегию на глобальной карте. 4. **Hearts of Iron IV** - хотя игра фокусируется в основном на времена Второй мировой войны, у вас также есть возможность управлять Советским Союзом и, в частности, проводить политику в регионе, который включает территорию средневековой Руси. 5. **Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition** - в этой классической стратегии в реальном времени есть фракция славян, которая охватывает обширную территорию включая восточную Европу и частично территорию древней Руси. Обратите внимание, что игра абстрагируется от строгой историчности в пользу баланса игрового процесса. Эти игры позволяют вам ощутить атмосферу того времени и управлять государством, включая возможность ведения политики, экономики и военных кампаний, а также погружение в историю региона."},{"prompt":"Write a year by year, plausible, realistic, alternate history timeline for a crossover fanfic of the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, manga, anime, and video game franchise, the Maburavu Anrimiteddo [Muv-Luv Unliminted |Maburavu Anrimiteddo|] visual novel, literature and anime franchise and its [Maburavu Anrimiteddo’s] spin-off/sequel visual novel, and literature franchise Maburavu Orutaneitibu [Muv-Luv Alternative], the obscure Omamori Himari anime and manga series, the Handoreddo [Hundred |Handoreddo|] light novel, manga and video game franchise, the Hidan no Aria [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo |Hidan no Aria|] light novel, manga and anime franchise, the Haiyore!

Each series comes with its own established lore and history which requires substantial adjustments to merge into a single narrative. To maintain plausibility and coherence, this timeline will focus on key events and take significant creative liberties to integrate these franchises. Please keep in mind that this timeline represents a high-level summary and a more detailed exploration would be required for an actual fanfic. **Year 0, Post-Daisaigai (PD):** The Great Cataclysm (Daisaigai) devastates the Earth, leaving most parts of the world uninhabitable. In Japan, the Ōtsutsuki Clan takes this opportunity to quietly assume control, working behind the scenes to stabilize the region. **Year 1, PD:** - **Europe:** remnants of the European Union establish fortifications to combat regional chaos. - **Asia:** The restored Chinese dynasties and the Japanese government under Ōtsutsuki reign begin reclamation efforts, gradually rebuilding society. - **America:** United States is fractured, some regions starting to reorganize themselves, others falling into dystopian disarray. **Year 5, PD:** - **Japan:** The Ōtsutsuki Clan consolidates control and begins to exert influence on its neighboring territories. - **America:** Survivors in Liberia form the United States of Liberia; Texas, Alaska, and Hawaii declare independence from the mainland USA. **Year 10, PD:** - **Technology:** Advances in IS and TSF units have started to trickle into global reconstruction efforts. - **Society:** Quirks and Divas begin to emerge among the population, forcing society to adapt and creating new power dynamics. **Year 15, PD:** - **Asia:** The Japanese Ōtsutsuki-led government begins territorial expansion, using advanced technology to claim surrounding regions. - **Europe:** The new Holy Britannian Empire forms, utilizing TSFs for security and expansion. **Year 20, PD:** - **Asia:** Japan establishes a governance system featuring Butei law enforcement, integrating Quirk and Diva users into society. - **North America:** Liberian-founded American territories push for reunification with mainland US fragments, with mixed success. **Year 25, PD:** - The emergence of Spirits (Seirei) leads to the formation of specialized anti-Spirit forces. - The Creatures of Grimm are on edge of extinction due to concerted military efforts using advanced technology including IS, TSF, and Century Armaments. **Year 30, PD:** - **Society:** Butei academies are a common alternative for young people, including those with Quirks, offering pathways into the military and law enforcement. - **Asia:** Japan secures its position as a dominant power in the region, possibly globally, due to its technological prowess and strategic use of the Ōtsutsuki Clan's abilities. **Year 35, PD:** - The Saint Empire Brittanique, leveraging its under the table connections to the Einzbern family and the Clocktower, begins a cold war with the Japanese-led Asian powers. - **Europe and Africa:** Begin forming alliances with the Britannian Empire for mutual defense and technological exchange. **Year 40, PD:** - **Global Politics:** The world is split among emerging superpowers — the Japanese Ōtsutsuki-led powers, the Saint Empire Brittanique, and other regional coalitions. - The Menagerie (Menajelli Oukoku) becomes a beacon for Faunus, leading to socio-political friction with Atlas. **Present Day in the Context of the Franchises:** - Advanced technology is widespread, though unevenly distributed, with IS units, TSFs, and Century Armaments as the pinnacle of military power. - Sovreign nations are strengthened or reconstituted under new governance, often with the backing of powerful families, mega-corporations, or secretive organizations. - The existence of Quirks, Divas, Spirits, and other such powers is an accepted, though sometimes regulated or ostracized, part of life. - Former superpowers (e.g. the United States, Russia) are either disintegrated into local warlord territories or struggling to regain former glories. - The Social Order is a mixture of new societal structures built on the integration of post-cataclysm powers like Quirks, and Divas, with the remnants of pre-Daisaigai political entities. Throughout this entire period, the balance between traditional systems, technological prowess, and supernatural abilities shapes a world on the cusp of a new era, one that is as fraught with dangers as it is filled with wonders. Plots from each involved franchise start to intertwine within this fabric of geopolitical and supernatural chaos, driving forward a narrative that unites their formerly disparate worlds."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history timeline presented in the previous entry: How was the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/the Dàyuè Shìzú kicked out of the ninja lands [the Genso no Kuni] and [the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/the Dàyuè Shìzú] forced to flee the Genso no Kuni and [the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/the Dàyuè Shìzú] make its [the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku's/the Dàyuè Shìzú's] way to the ruins of the Land of the Rising Sun [post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato]?","completion":"According to the established alternate history timeline, the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/Dàyuè Shìzú was forced to flee the Genso no Kuni and relocate to post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato. This could have occurred due to a coalition effort from the people and various powers within the Genso no Kuni, including chakra-wielding faux shinobi and xiūxiānzhě cultivators, who perceived the Ōtsutsuki as a threat to their existence and sovereignty. Here's a rough sequence of events leading to their expulsion: **Pre-Daisaigai Era:** - The Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/Dàyuè Shìzú enters the Genso no Kuni through undisclosed means and begins to assert influence over the inhabitants by showcasing their immense powers, positioning themselves as deities. - The Ōtsutsuki introduce the concept of chakra to the human population, which over time evolves into the shinobi system. **Initial Rebellion (Around 100 years before the canon Naruto series):** - A resistance forms among the chakra-wielding populace who begin to understand the true nature of the Ōtsutsuki. Secrets of their origin and their manipulation are uncovered by secret sects within the shinobi population and the xiūxiānzhě. - Initially scattered and underground, the resistance grows as rogue shinobi, hermit sages, and even some clans unite against the common extraterrestrial adversary. **The Great Shinobi Rebellion:** - The coalition of shinobi and xiūxiānzhě decides to take a stand. Utilizing their mastery of chakra, knowledge of seals, and forbidden jutsus, they engage the Ōtsutsuki in a desperate and grand conflict. - This battle sees losses on both sides, but the ingenuity and sacrificial tactics of the shinobi turn the tide, weakening the Ōtsutsuki's grip on Genso no Kuni. **The Daisaigai and the Ōtsutsuki Retreat:** - The Daisaigai occurs, causing global calamity and pushing the world to the brink of ruin. The Genso no Kuni is not spared, and the chaos provides an opportunity for the coalition to ramp up their resistance. - Realizing the changing tide and the unpredictability of the destabilized world, the Ōtsutsuki decide to retreat strategically. They use their powers to escape the conflict, seeking refuge and perhaps a chance to regain power elsewhere. **The Ōtsutsuki Arrival in Post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato:** - Japan, like much of the world, is in disarray post-Daisaigai. The Ōtsutsuki see an opportunity to re-establish dominion in a technologically advanced and strategically located territory. - Utilizing their advanced knowledge and abilities, the Ōtsutsuki swiftly establish control over the surviving Japanese, exploiting both the need for leadership in a devastated landscape and the absence of rival powers that have been weakened or obliterated by the Daisaigai. **The New Order:** - With the Ōtsutsuki's strategic acumen and otherworldly powers, Japan is quickly stabilized. The extraterrestrial clan reshapes the country's ruins into a new kingdom they rule as a new Ōke (imperial family), leveraging both advanced technologies and their supernatural abilities to revive the nation and extend their influence. This narrative allows for the Ōtsutsuki to undergo a transformation from divine rulers of the hidden continent to rulers of a restored Japan, setting the stage for their role in the provided alternate history timeline. The expulsion and regrouping of the Ōtsutsuki also lay the foundation for further conflicts and storylines that could be explored in detail within a crossover fanfic or series."},{"prompt":"Staying

The timeline assumes that the Daisaigai occurs simultaneously with the initial expulsion from Genso no Kuni. **Year -100 PD (Pre-Daisaigai)** - The Genso no Kuni flourishes with an independent shinobi system but lives under the shadow of the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku's influence. - Secretly oppressed populations yearn for freedom from their deceptive deities' rule. **Year 0 (Daisaigai)** - The Daisaigai occurs, leaving worldwide devastation. - With the world in disarray, the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/Dàyuè Shìzú retreats, sensing an opportunity in the chaos to find a new stronghold. **Year 1 PD** - The coalition in the Genso no Kuni formally declares victory against the weakened Ōtsutsuki following their unexpected departure. - The Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku, using their space-time manipulation abilities and doujutsu, locates post-Daisaigai Kyoto, identifying it as a suitable base for resurgence due to its spiritual significance and tactical position. **Year 2 PD** - The Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku takes up residence in the Kyōto-gosho, begins reconstructing it to suit their otherworldly aesthetics and capabilities. - The surviving Japanese, in awe or fear of the Ōtsutsuki's abilities that resemble the kami of Shinto, are swayed to follow their lead. **Year 3-4 PD** - The Ōtsutsuki uses Fūinjutsu to safeguard areas against the volatile post-Daisaigai environment, preserving resources and people. - Their healing abilities are shared selectively to garner loyalty from key figures in the military, including stranded Jietai, Keisatsu-chō, and ex-US Armed Forces. **Year 5-9 PD** - A gradual conquest of the surrounding regions is undertaken as the Ōtsutsuki validate their rule through displays of power and the promise of stability utilizing their Bloodline Limits and ancient knowledge. - They incorporate existing military structures such as stranded Jietai units into their new order, rebranded as guardians of the new Ōke. **Year 10 PD** - The Ōtsutsuki have expanded their hold to most of Japan, establish a new governance system, and begin rebuilding society in earnest. - Through strategic alliances, displays of power, and the use of Kekkei Genkai, the Ōtsutsuki seat themselves firmly as the new Ōke of Japan. **Year 15 PD** - Technology, including remnants of IS and TSF units, are adapted to fit the Ōtsutsuki's agenda, forming a powerful defense system. - The Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku begins looking outward, seeking to influence other post-Daisaigai powers through diplomatic and sometimes ominous means. **Year 20-30 PD** - The Ōtsutsuki-led Japan has transformed into a beacon of power and technological advancement in the post-Daisaigai world. - Under the guise of helping other struggling regions, the Ōtsutsuki expand their influence beyond Japan, with the Kyōto-gosho shining as the symbol of their power. This timeline creates a foundation for the significant presence and influence of the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/Dàyuè Shìzú in a post-Daisaigai world. The integrated use of their powers, such as Byakugan and Shikotsumyaku, combined with their mastery of Fūinjutsu, allowed them to establish dominance and bring order to a chaotic post-Daisaigai Nihon. The narrative compromises a mix of calculated manipulation, displays of supernatural strength, and strategic alliances with existing military forces to gradually restore and control the region under the ascendancy of the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku as the new imperial house."},{"prompt":"Staying and contiuning with the alternate history timeline presented in the previous entries: Great!

Here's how the process unfolded: **Year 1-5 PD:** - The Ōtsutsuki begin restoring post-Daisaigai Kyoto, using their advanced knowledge and bloodline abilities to create both a defensible fortress and an economically viable stronghold. - The Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyōto-gosho) is refurbished and expanded using a mixture of traditional Nihon-jin architectural styles and Ōtsutsuki aesthetics, establishing the city as a symbol of their rule. **Year 6 PD:** - Having established their hold over Kyoto, the Ōtsutsuki negotiate and then engage in a bloodless takeover of the Dai Tokyo Teikoku, where the previous rule had been weakened due to the Daisaigai and internal strife. - The Kokkai's structure is maintained, but the Ōtsutsuki influence the election of officials, ensuring their ascendancy in the political domain. **Year 7-10 PD:** - Focusing their efforts on Tokyo, the Ōtsutsuki use a combination of their Fūinjutsu to repair the damaged environment and IS and TSF technology to build defensive structures, making the city an impregnable fortress and a testament to their power. - Tokyo Imperial Palace (Kōkyo) construction begins, using the Dai Tokyo Teikoku's industrial capacity, the design amalgamates the modern aesthetics with spaces designed to accommodate the Ōtsutsuki's unique abilities. **Year 11-15 PD:** - With the Kōkyo nearly complete, the Ōtsutsuki orchestrate a large-scale campaign to reconstruct the nation's infrastructure, leveraging both human and Ōtsutsuki knowledge. - The Ōtsutsuki empower select Nihon-jin and remnants of the Jietai and Tokushu Kyūshū Butai to become elite protectors of the realm, armed with upgraded IS and TSF technology. **Year 16-20 PD:** - The Kōkyo stands finished, a grand spectacle combining opulent traditional elements with unearthly Ōtsutsuki constructions, illustrating a thriving, reborn post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato. - The Ōtsutsuki formalize their rule, establishing academies for the training of new Jietai recruits, Butei law enforcement, and strategic governance forums where the Kokkai serves as an assembly for discussing national interests under the careful oversight of the Ōtsutsuki. **Year 21-25 PD:** - The Kōkyo becomes not just a political center but a hub of cultural and technological exchange, blending the new-found abilities of Quirk and Diva users with traditional elements. - Recognizing the need for further technological advancement, the Ōtsutsuki sponsor the development of new generations of IS and TSF units, furthering Nihon/Nippon/Yamato's military might and its ability to maintain peace and order. **Year 26-30 PD:** - Post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato is now a leading global power, with the Kōkyo and Kyōto-gosho serving as twin jewels in the crown. The former is the nerve center for international diplomacy and military power, while the latter is a wellspring of culture and tradition. - Under Ōtsutsuki rule, the nation achieves a level of prosperity and stability thought impossible in the immediate aftermath of the Daisaigai, with the Ōtsutsuki regarded as divine protectors by many. The Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku/Dàyuè Shìzú, through strategic deployment of their powers and advanced technology, transform the landscape of post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato, creating a nation that is a confluence of mysticism and progress. They reshape Nihon's political structure, resurrecting the Kokkai and the concept of governance while securely placing the Ōtsutsuki at the apex of power.

Under their rule, post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato experienced a renaissance in governance and defense capabilities. Here's an expanded view on the process: **Reclamation of Territories:** **Year 5-10 PD:** - Using their advanced understanding of Fūinjutsu and chakra, the Ōtsutsuki fortify the Nihon Hondo, preventing further Gastrea incursions and laying the groundwork for territorial expansion. - Amidst the chaos of the Daisaigai's aftermath, the Ōtsutsuki leadership presents itself as a stabilizing force, offering protection and governance to the former provinces in exchange for fealty. **Year 11-15 PD:** - Diplomatic endeavors are coupled with a display of military might. The upgraded IS and TSF units, now embedded with chakra-infused technology, provide overwhelming strategic advantages over the Gastrea and any potential resisting force in the reclaimed territories. - The Ōtsutsuki's pacification of Chōsen, Karufuto, Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu, and Formosa is executed with precision, ensuring minimal civilian casualties and quickly rebuilding trust among the local population. **Suppression of Gastrea Threat:** **Year 16-20 PD:** - The Ōtsutsuki utilize their extensive knowledge of biology, blended with chakra manipulation techniques, to understand and counteract the Gastrea biology. - Specialized teams of IS and TSF operators trained in Gastrea combat tactics are formed, systematically eliminating infestations in affected regions. **Year 21-25 PD:** - Continuing their efforts, the Ōtsutsuki support advances in medical and biological sciences, which lead to the development of a vaccine and treatment methods to prevent the Gastrea virus's spread. - The Gastrea presence dwindles significantly, allowing safe zones to be established and reconstruction efforts to commence. **Integration of Chakra in IS and TSF Development:** **Year 25-30 PD:** - Chakra is reverse-engineered into new materials and alloys enhancing the performance of IS and TSF units, making them more resilient and adaptable to various combat scenarios. - Operators receive specialized training, making them capable of synchronizing with their units on a deeper level, using chakra to enhance response times and combat abilities. **Governance Lessons Integrated from the Genso no Kuni:** **Year 30-35 PD:** - Borrowing from the shinobi social structure, the Ōtsutsuki introduce a system of merit-based rank and recognition, fostering a culture of loyalty and excellence among military and civilian personnel. - The idea of Chūnin-Exams-like evaluations is adopted for public servants, ensuring that only the most skilled and loyal individuals rise to positions of leadership and influence. **Year 36-40 PD:** - The Ōtsutsuki promote the formation of specialized clans within the military and political spheres, each with unique capabilities and roles akin to traditional shinobi clans. - Village councils, similar to shinobi village systems, are set up to provide localized governance under the watchful eye of the Ōtsutsuki, maintaining a balance between autonomy and central control. By the time the events of the aforementioned series unfold, post-Daisaigai Nihon/Nippon/Yamato under Ōtsutsuki rule has effectively managed to consolidate its hold over the Nihon Hondo and the lost provinces, suppress the Gastrea threat, and integrate advanced technologies with mystical practices to create a formidable nation. Governance strategies from the Genso no Kuni, tweaked for a modern post-Daisaigai society, have also been applied to ensure a stable and prosperous nation deftly governed by the Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku."},{"prompt":"Staying and contiuning with the alternate history timeline presented in the previous entries: Drifting from Asia a bit, how did das Königshaus von Einzbern seize control of the Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d’Irlande du Nord from its [Das Königshaus von Einzbern's] base in the Clocktower in the wake of the Daisaigai and how did it [das Königshaus von Einzbern] solidify its [das Königshaus von Einzbern’s] rule over Les Iles Britanniques/Britannica Ostrova and [das Königshaus von Einzbern] suppress human dissent and resistance as well as [das Königshaus von Einzbern] deal with Gastrea infections, Grimm hordes and Infernal packs roaming about Les Iles Britanniques/Britannica Ostrova in the wake of the Daisaigai?

What is the number of shares of Wyatt Oil that you hold? (5 marks) b) Suppose that you have 100,000 invested in the market portfolio and that the stock price of Taggart Transcontinental suddenly drops to 7.80 per share. Which of the following trades would you need to make in order to maintain your investment in the market portfolio? Interpret your answers. 1. Buy approximately 1140 shares of Taggart Transcontinental 2. Sell approximately 256 shares of Rearden Metal 3. Sell approximately 57 shares of Wyatt Oil 4. Sell approximately 148 shares of Nielson Motors","completion":"To answer these questions, we first need to calculate the total market value of each stock and then determine the proportion of each stock within the market portfolio. Then we can find out the number of shares of Wyatt Oil held and what adjustments we need to make to maintain the market portfolio after the price change of Taggart Transcontinental. a) First, let's calculate the total market value of each stock: Taggart Transcontinental: 15.60 * 25 million = 390 million Rearden Metal: 13.00 * 45 million = 585 million Wyatt Oil: 29.25 * 10 million = 292.5 million Nielson Motors: 26.25 * 26 million = 682.5 million Total market value = 390M + 585M + 292.5M + 682.5M = 1950 million Next, we'll find the market weight of each stock (proportion of each in the market portfolio): Weight of Taggart Transcontinental: 390M / 1950M = 0.2 Weight of Rearden Metal: 585M / 1950M = 0.3 Weight of Wyatt Oil: 292.5M / 1950M = 0.15 Weight of Nielson Motors: 682.5M / 1950M = 0.35 Now, if you have invested 18,000 in Taggart Transcontinental, this represents the weight of Taggart in your own portfolio, which should be equal to the weight of Taggart in the overall market portfolio since you are holding a market portfolio. To find the number of shares of Wyatt Oil that you hold, we first need to find out the total value of your investment in the market portfolio. If 18,000 is 20% of your portfolio (weight of Taggart Transcontinental), then your total investment in the market portfolio is: 18,000 / 0.2 = 90,000 The value of your holdings in Wyatt Oil, which has a market weight of 0.15 (15%), is: 90,000 * 0.15 = 13,500 Now, we can calculate the number of shares of Wyatt Oil you hold by dividing the value of the investment in Wyatt Oil by the price per share: 13,500 / 29.25 = 461.54 shares Since fractional shares cannot be held, you might own either 461 or 462 shares, depending on the convention or the level of rounding permitted by the trading platform you're using. b) With the sudden drop in the share price of Taggart Transcontinental to 7.80, the total market value is recalculated, and the weights of each stock in the market portfolio will change. Taggart's market weight drops, so to maintain the market portfolio, an investor would need to buy more shares of Taggart to bring its weight back up to 0.2. If Taggart's price per share is halved to 7.80, and the number of shares outstanding remains unchanged, its market value will also be halved: New Taggart Transcontinental market value: 390M / 2 = 195 million The new total market value will be: New Total Market Value = 195M + 585M + 292.5M + 682.5M = 1754.5 million The new weight of Taggart Transcontinental is: Weight of Taggart Transcontinental: 195M / 1754.5M ≈ 0.1111 (approximately 11.11%) The 100,000 investment needs to have approximately 11.11% in Taggart now. This means, the updated value in Taggart should be: 100,000 * 0.1111 ≈ 11,110 But since the price has halved, to maintain the same market weight, we need to double the number of Taggart shares held in the market portfolio. To find out how many additional shares to buy: Number of additional Taggart shares to buy = (Original value of investment in Taggart - New value of investment in Taggart) / New price per share Assuming the original investment was 20,000 (with old weight 0.2): Additional shares to buy = (20,000 - 11,110) / 7.80 ≈ 8,890 / 7.80 ≈ 1140 shares Therefore, option 1 is correct, and you would need to buy approximately 1140 shares of Taggart Transcontinental to maintain the market portfolio. Options 2, 3, and 4 mention selling other shares, but without more information on the current investment distribution across the other stocks, we cannot accurately determine the number of shares to sell. The primary adjustment is to the weight of Taggart Transcontinental due to its halved price. These other options could be part of a rebalancing strategy, but without more data, it's not possible to specify which, if any, of these trades is correct. Please note that this simplified model assumes that investors can only adjust the number of shares of Taggart Transcontinental to maintain the market portfolio's balance. In reality, a change in one stock's price would affect the overall portfolio and could require rebalancing across multiple assets. Also, transaction costs and minimum trading quantities can affect how precisely the market portfolio can be maintained."},{"prompt":"What constitutes reckless assault in the third degree in the state of New York?","completion":"In the state of New York, assault in the third degree can be classified as \\"reckless assault\\" under specific circumstances. According to the New York Penal Law § 120.00, a person is guilty of assault in the third degree when, with intent to cause physical injury to another person, he or she causes such injury to such person or to a third person, or: 1. He or she recklessly causes physical injury to another person; or 2. With criminal negligence, he or she causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument. The key element for reckless assault is the recklessness with which the injury is caused. Recklessness in this context means that the person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his or her actions will cause physical injury to another. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard of it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. Assault in the third degree is considered a class A misdemeanor in New York, punishable by a maximum of one year in jail, probation, fines, and/or restitution to the victim. It's important to note that legal definitions and the interpretation of laws can change, and the application of the law can vary based on specific circumstances. Therefore, for the most current and applicable legal advice or if charged with a crime, it is important to consult with a licensed attorney who can provide guidance relevant to the specific case in question."},{"prompt":"A man and woman who were in a taxi in New York had a dispute inside of the cab. The woman tried to exit the cab. The man tried to push her back into the cab several times, according to recorded video. If the woman was injured, could she reasonably be charged with reckless assault in the third degree in the state of New York. Take a deep breath and think step by step before committing to a final answer.","completion":"Based on the information provided and the definition of reckless assault in the third degree in New York, it appears the man, rather than the woman, could potentially be charged with this offense if his actions resulted in the woman's injury. To clarify, here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. **Definition of Reckless Assault**: New York Penal Law § 120.00 states that a person is guilty of assault in the third degree when he/she recklessly causes physical injury to another person. 2. **Analysis of the Man’s Actions**: If the man tried to push the woman back into the cab several times, and this action resulted in the woman sustaining a physical injury, his actions could be considered reckless. He would be aware that forcefully preventing someone from exiting a vehicle could lead to injury. 3. **Woman’s Potential Charges**: As for the woman, there is no indication from the scenario that she acted recklessly or with any intent to cause physical injury. Without additional context suggesting that she engaged in conduct which led to her own or someone else's injury, there’s no basis for charging her with reckless assault based on the provided scenario. 4. **Potential Charges for the Man**: If the recorded video shows that the man was trying to push the woman back into the taxi and she was injured as a result, the man could potentially be charged with reckless assault in the third degree. If his actions were intentional rather than reckless, he could face different or additional charges. 5. **Required Elements for Charges**: To charge someone with reckless assault, certain elements must be met, including a reckless action and an injury resulting from that action. The determination of what charges are appropriate would depend on the specific facts, the nature of the injury, and the evidence available, such as the recorded video. It would ultimately be up to law enforcement to decide whether to arrest and subsequently up to the prosecutorial authority to decide whether to charge the man based on their interpretation of the incident and the evidence at hand. If you meant to ask if the woman could be charged because she tried to exit the cab and was then injured, the answer is still no. Trying to exit a vehicle is not an act that recklessly causes injury. Any charge would depend on actions that directly result in injury through reckless conduct. Under normal circumstances, simply trying to exit a vehicle does not meet this criterion."},{"prompt":"Write a year by year, plausible, realistic, alternate history timeline for a crossover fanfic of the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, manga, anime, and video game franchise, the Maburavu Anrimiteddo [Muv-Luv Unlimited |Maburavu Anrimiteddo|] visual novel, literature and anime franchise and its [Maburavu Anrimiteddo’s] spin-off/sequel visual novel, and literature franchise Maburavu Orutaneitibu [Muv-Luv Alternative], the Tenchi Muyo!

This begins the reconstruction of a new Co-Prosperity Sphere. - The Ōtsutsuki establish a system similar to the villain Hunter programs from RWBY, but with modernized equipment and wide-reaching authority. - The Cursed Children Phenomenon is managed under a system similar to the Genin and Jonin pairings, creating an elite force able to contend with new threats. **Year 1 AR (After RWBY series starts):** - Conflict erupts between the sprawling Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule and the military-ruled Atlas over exploitation of Faunus and withholding technology. - A group of Chasseurs from Vale accidentally discovers a joint Nihon-Manju-Huárén military operation, breaking the myth of the Mǐsītèlāěr Wángguó's isolation. **Year 5 AR:** - The emergence of Quirks and Divas leads to the expansion of the covert Tokushu Shōbōtai with Nihon's Jietai. - The creatures of Grimm are on the brink of extinction in the East due to the efficiency of Jietai operations, while Vale, Atlas, and the nations in the ruins of other powers struggle to control their territories. - Atlas and the newly formed United States of Liberia come into conflict over the latter's swift expansion into post-Daisaigai America's former territories. **Year 10 AR:** - Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule, also known as the Menajelli Oukoku, becomes a safe haven for Faunus, increasing tensions with Atlas. - The Ōtsutsuki Clan returns to the Genso no Kuni, dismantling ancient systems of shinobi and heroes. They replace these systems with the Butei framework to manage and regulate individuals with extraordinary powers effectively. **Year 15 AR:** - With the world teetering on the edge of a new international order, hidden battles rage. The Meta Liberation Army's influence wanes, rogue Diva users rise, and the Faunus liberation movement gains momentum. - Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule unveils advanced combat tech integrating IS units, Century Armaments, and chakra-infused Kikai-Ka Heishi to solidify their grip on East Asia. **Year 20 AR:** - The Saint Empire Brittanique, forged from the union of Vale and the UK, emerges as a new power bloc, leveraging the combined might of TSFs, IS Units, Century Armaments, and Traditional Chasseurs in their fight for dominance. - The Anti-Spirit Team (Anchi Supiritto Chīmu) is formed within Nihon under Ōtsutsuki rule to address the growing problem of Spirits infiltrating the world, using advanced IS Units that remain hidden from the public. **Ongoing Developments:** - As the events of the individual series commence, these historical events have already shaped a world vastly different from the canon. Powers vie for control, the balance of technology and ancient power shifts, and the world gears up for a new era that could elevate or shatter the fragile peace. **Please Note:** This timeline integrates elements, characters, and technologies from multiple series within a single universe, functioning within its own internal logic and historical progression without invoking multiverse or multiversal travel concepts."},{"prompt":"A man and woman who were in a taxi in New York had a dispute inside of the cab. The woman tried to exit the taxi. The man tried to push her back into the taxi several times according to recorded video. If the woman was injured during this dispute, could she reasonably be charged with reckless assault in the third degree in the state of New York. Take a deep breath and think step by step before committing to a final answer.","completion":"In the state of New York, assault in the third degree is defined under New York Penal Law Section 120.00. An individual is guilty of assault in the third degree when: 1. With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he or she causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or 2. He or she recklessly causes physical injury to another person; or 3. With criminal negligence, he or she causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument. From the scenario you've provided, it appears the man was actively trying to push the woman back into the taxi, suggesting that any physical injury resulting from the dispute might be directly linked to his actions. It doesn't seem that the woman's actions would fit the criteria for assault in the third degree since she was attempting to exit the taxi, which is a reasonable and lawful action. If she was injured, it would likely be due to the man's actions in pushing her. For the woman to be charged with reckless assault, her actions would have to recklessly cause physical injury to another person. The fact that she was the one trying to exit the taxi does not suggest recklessness on her part in causing injury to another person. Furthermore, in a legal context, “recklessly” implies an awareness and conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result will occur or a circumstance exists. It is a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. Therefore, based on your description, it is unlikely that the woman exiting the taxi could be reasonably charged with reckless assault in the third degree. If the woman were injured by the man pushing her, it would more likely be the man who could potentially be charged with assault, as his actions would be considered the cause of any potential injuries sustained by the woman. The man's behavior could possibly be seen as intentional or reckless, making him the potential defendant, not the woman trying to exit the taxi. However, the final determination of any charges would be based on the full facts of the case as assessed by law enforcement and the prosecutor's office. It is also important to consider that this response is based on the information provided and does not constitute legal advice."},{"prompt":"Write a year by year, plausible, realistic, alternate history timeline for a crossover fanfic of the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, manga, anime, and video game franchise, the Maburavu Anrimiteddo [Muv-Luv Unlimited |Maburavu Anrimiteddo|] visual novel, literature and anime franchise and its [Maburavu Anrimiteddo’s] spin-off/sequel visual novel, and literature franchise Maburavu Orutaneitibu [Muv-Luv Alternative], the Tenchi Muyo!

Please Note: There is no multiverse, alternate worlds, multiple worlds, dimensional crossing, or any other stuff of that sort in this timeline. All the events in this timeline take place within the same world and occur in chronological order.","completion":"Creating a detailed alternate history crossover timeline that includes all the specified franchises with coherent year-by-year events would be an enormous task that far exceeds the practical limits of this platform. However, I can outline a general conceptual framework for how such a crossover might develop: **Pre-Daisaigai Era**: - The history of the world develops similarly to our own up to a certain point, with cultural and historical references from the various franchises starting to mix. For example, the Gen Ouchou may have been a dynasty that once ruled Nihon/Nippon/Yamato centuries before the canon events of any involved series, potentially replacing or joining historical rulers. - Technologies like IS (Infinite Stratos) Units and TSF (Tactical Surface Fighters) are developed in secret by scientists all across the globe, stemming from a shared thread of research into advanced propulsion and armor systems that started post-WWII but took different routes in different parts of the world. - Chakra and magic are known only to a select few, hidden from public view, with connections forming between those who can manipulate such powers, leading to secret societies that cross national boundaries. - Entities like the Ōtsutsuki Clan operate in the shadows, influencing events on a global scale without open recognition, until emerging publicly post-Daisaigai. **Daisaigai Era**: - An all-out war breaks out, devastating much of the planet, which becomes the key event that reshapes the political and geographical landscape. Advanced technologies are finally used openly, leading to significant shifts in power. - The Ōtsutsuki Clan takes advantage of the chaos to establish dominance over Nihon/Nippon/Yamato, positioning themselves as protectors yet rulers of the war-torn lands. **Post-Daisaigai Era**: - The aftermath of the war leads to a reformation of nations and the birth of new powers that combine the remnants of old governments with the influence of surviving factions from various franchises. - The Quirks phenomenon emerges publicly; people born with these abilities are folded into the newly forming social structures, sometimes leading to discrimination, which is mirrored in the treatment of Faunus in other regions. - Special teams and units allied with various governments (like the Butei, Tokushu Shōbōtai, and the Anchi Supiritto Chīmu) work to maintain order and face threats like Seirei incursions, Savage attacks, and Gastrea infections. **Reintegration Era**: - Sovereign states and entities like the Saint Empire Britannique, the Kingdom of Vale and the Kingdom of Menagerie work to expand their influence, leading to tensions over resources, technology, and territory. - Protagonists from the canon series begin their journeys, with their personal stories intertwining with the larger world narrative. Their actions influence the balances of power and contribute to the resolution of global crises. **New World Order Era**: - The lessons learned from the Daisaigai lead to a more unified global governance structure, with the acknowledgment and integration of magic, chakra, Quirks, and other supernatural elements into everyday society. - Threats like rouge Diva users, the Meta Liberation Army, and insurgent groups like the White Fang continue to challenge the status quo, leading to ongoing conflicts that require the joint efforts of heroes and governments to resolve. In creating such a timeline, it is essential to establish the fundamental rules governing the interaction between franchises, develop a coherent system that respects each franchise's lore, and then weave the characters and their stories into a singular narrative arc that spans the specified timeframe."},{"prompt":"A man and woman who were in a taxi in New York had a dispute inside of the cab. The woman tried to exit the taxi. The man tried to push her back into the taxi several times according to recorded video. If the woman was injured during this dispute, could he reasonably be charged with reckless assault in the third degree in the state of New York. Take a deep breath and think step by step before committing to a final answer.","completion":"In New York State, assault in the third degree, classified under Penal Law § 120.00, typically involves causing physical injury to another person either intentionally or through criminal negligence. To consider charges of reckless assault in the third degree, one would have to look at the specifics of the incident and the legal definitions involved. The relevant portion of the statute reads as follows: \\"A person is guilty of assault in the third degree when: 1. With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or 2. He recklessly causes physical injury to another person; or 3. With criminal negligence, he causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.\\" In the scenario described, it seems the man's actions could potentially meet the criteria for the second point—recklessly causing physical injury to another person—if several conditions are met: 1. **Recklessness**: The man's actions would have to be considered reckless, which means they would be deemed to have been done in disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his behavior would result in injury. The video evidence of him pushing the woman repeatedly could support this. 2. **Physical Injury**: The woman must have actually sustained physical injury as a result of the man's actions. In legal terms, physical injury must involve impairment of physical condition or substantial pain. 3. **Causation**: It must be established that the man's actions were a direct cause of the woman's injury. Assuming these elements can be demonstrated based on the evidence (such as the recorded video and any medical reports documenting the woman's injuries), the man could potentially face charges of assault in the third degree under the recklessness provision. However, it is important to note that the final determination of charges would be made by prosecutors, based on all available evidence and the specifics of the case. Moreover, any criminal charge would also depend on a thorough investigation by law enforcement and possibly a grand jury's decision on whether to indict. If the woman were injured and it can be shown that the man's actions were reckless and directly led to her injuries, then yes, it would be feasible for him to face charges of assault in the third degree according to New York law."},{"prompt":"Mi a különbség a dekódoló és a demultiplexer között?

A demultiplexer tehát egy bemeneti jelet visz át különböző kimenetekre, de egyszerre mindig csak egy kimeneten lehet aktív a jel.

A helyes megfogalmazás a 3 bemenetű ÉS kapu megvalósítására a következő: Egy 3 bemenetű ÉS kapu megvalósításához nem szokás multiplexert használni. Az ÉS kapu működése egyszerű: csak akkor ad ki 1-es értéket, ha minden bemenetén 1 van. Egy multiplexerrel ez nem valósítható meg közvetlenül, mivel a multiplexer választó bemenetei nem hajtanak végre logikai műveletet az adatbemenetekkel; inkább csak kiválasztják az egyik adatbemenetet, hogy azon keresztül továbbítódjon a jel.

Logikai függvények megvalósítása dekódolóval: Egy dekódoló (DEC) általában n bemeneti jelet képes \\"dekódolni\\", vagyis 2^n különböző kimenetre átváltani.

Ezek az alapelemek két egy bit méretű számot tudnak összeadni, a teljes összeadó esetén figyelembe véve egy esetleges előző helyiértékből származó átvitelt is. Összeadás lépései: 1. A legalacsonyabb helyiértékekkel rendelkező biteket (legkisebb súlyú bitek, azaz jobb szélső bit helyeken) adjuk össze először, használva egy egyszerű összeadót vagy a teljes összeadó első elemeként szolgálhat (itt még nincsen átvitel). 2.

A kétkomplementer-módszer lényege, hogy a kivonandó számot először kétkomplementer alakba hozzuk, majd ezt az értéket hozzáadjuk a minuendhez (az a szám, amiből kivonunk). Az alábbi lépésekkel hajtható végre a kivonás összeadók használatával: 1. **Kétkomplementer előállítása:** A kivonandó szám (subtrahend) bitjeit invertáljuk (vagyis az 1-eseket 0-ra, a 0-ákat 1-re cseréljük), majd hozzáadunk 1-et. Így kapjuk meg a kivonandó szám kétkomplementerét. 2. **Összeadás:** Az összeadó áramkör segítségével adjuk össze a minuend értékét és a kivonandó szám kétkomplementer értékét. 3. **Kimeneti értékelés:** Ha az összeadás során keletkezik átvitel az összeadók legmagasabb helyiértékű bitjéből, akkor ez az átviteli bit egyszerűen elhagyható (ezáltal \\"pozitív\\" eredményről van szó). Ha nem keletkezik átvitel (és az eredmények mérete megegyezik a kiindulási számok méretével), az eredmény negatív, a kétkomplementer módszer miatt, és a végső érték megfordításával (ún. \\"negálásával\\") kaphatjuk meg a valódi negatív értéket. Ez a módszer azért működik, mert a kétkomplementer-számrendszert használó bináris rendszerben a kivonás helyett összeadunk egy negatív számot.

Vegyünk egy egyszerű példát, ahol kivonunk a 6 számból 3-at bináris formában, használva összeadókat. Először is, alakítsuk át őket 4 bites bináris számokká, hogy legyen hely az esetleges átvitel számára: 6 (decimális) = 0110 (bináris) 3 (decimális) = 0011 (bináris) Most hozzuk létre a 3 bináris, kétkomplementeres alakját: 1. Az 0011 bináris számot invertáljuk: 1100 2. Az invertált számhoz adjunk hozzá 1-et: 1100 + 0001 = 1101 Ezután adjuk össze a minuend-et (6-ot, binárisan 0110) és a kivonandó szám kétkomplementeres alakját (3-at, binárisan 1101): \`\`\` 0110 (6 decimálisban) + 1101 (-3 decimálisban kétkomplementer formában) ------ 10011 (Ez öt bites eredmény, de mivel 4 bitesekkel dolgozunk, a legmagasabb bitet elhagyjuk, mely átviteli bitként szolgál) \`\`\` Elhagyva az ötödik bitet (átviteli bit, melyet általában C vagy \\"Carry\\" jelöl), marad: \`0011\` ami 3-as számot jelent decimálisban, és ez az érték helyes, mert 6 - 3 = 3.

Amikor 4 bites számokkal dolgozunk, például, akkor a lehető legnagyobb szám, amit fel tudunk fejezni, az 0111 (decimálisban 7). Ha hozzáadnánk ehhez 1-et a legjobban balra eső bitre (MSB, Most Significant Bit), amit átvitelként is értelmezhetünk, akkor kapnánk egy 1000 (decimálisban -8-at a kétkomplementer rendszerben). Tehát egy túlcsordulást (carry) produkálunk, amikor a számrendszerünk által megengedett legnagyobb értéket túllépve, újra a legkisebb értékű számnál (a kétkomplementer rendszerben a legnagyobb negatív szám) \\"kezdjük\\" az új számlálást. Ez a viselkedés azért jön létre, mert korlátozott számú bitet használunk a számok ábrázolására, és a kétkomplementer számrendszerben egy extra MSB carry bit automatikusan \\"eltűnik\\" vagy értelmetlen lesz, mert kívül esik a használt számhosszon. Korábbi példánkban 4 bites számokkal dolgoztunk, tehát bármilyen összeadás eredményét csak 4 biten kell ábrázolni. Amikor a 0110 (6) és a 1101 (-3) összegéből egy ötödik bit keletkezik (carry), az azt jelenti, hogy túlmentünk a 4 bites reprezentáció határain, és a legjobban balra eső bit visszatér a legalacsonyabb helyi értékű pozícióba a moduláris aritmetika miatt. Ez a bit tehát nem része az értelmezett eredményünknek, mivel csak 4 bitet használunk, ezért egyszerűen elhagyhatjuk. Az eredményünk a többi 4 bitben marad, ami helyesen fejezi ki a 3-as decimális értéket."},{"prompt":"• Mi az ALU? • Hogyan valósítható meg egy ALU?","completion":"**Mi az az ALU?** Az ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit - Aritmetikai Logikai Egység) egy digitális áramkör, amely az összeadás, kivonás és más típusú aritmetikai műveletek, valamint logikai műveletek (AND, OR, XOR, NOT stb.) elvégzéséért felelős a számítógép CPU-ján (Central Processing Unit - Központi Feldolgozó Egység) belül. Az ALU létfontosságú komponens minden számítógépes rendszerben, mivel ez végzi el az összes alapvető számítást, amelyeken a programok futtatása alapul. **Hogyan valósítható meg egy ALU?** Egy ALU megvalósításához számos összeadó áramkörre (egyszerű és teljes összeadókra), multiplexerekre, logikai kapukra (AND, OR stb.), és regiszterekre (adattárolásra szolgáló áramkörökre) van szükség, továbbá olyan vezérlő logikára, ami a kívánt műveletet választja ki és irányítja az adatfolyamot az ALU-n belül. Az alapvető összetevők a következők: 1. **Összeadók/Levonók:** Az összeadók lehetővé teszik az aritmetikai műveletek végrehajtását, például az összeadást és kivonást (kétkomplementeres módszerrel). 2. **Logikai kapuk:** Ezek végzik az ALU logikai műveleteit, mint például az AND, OR, XOR és NOT műveleteket. 3. **Shift regiszterek:** Ezek szükségesek lehetnek a bitmanipulációs műveletekhez, mint például a balra vagy jobbra történő biteltolások. 4. **Multiplexerek:** Az ALU-ban a multiplexerek választják ki az egyes műveletek eredményét a különböző kapuk és összeadók közül a vezérlőjelek alapján, amit a CPU küld. 5. **Vezérlő logika:** A vezérlő logika dönti el, hogy az ALU melyik műveletet hajtsa végre, és ez alapján állítja be a különböző kapcsolóelemeket (pl. multiplexerek) a megfelelő állapotba. 6. **Áramerősség-Detektor (Flags):** Ez a része az ALU-nak figyeli a speciális feltételeket, mint például az átvitel, a túlcsordulás, negatív vagy nulla eredményt a műveletek után, és ezeket az információkat vezérlőjelek formájában továbbítja. Az ALU-k nagyon összetett áramkörök lehetnek, amelyeket a tervezés során gyakran részletesebben integrált áramkörökbe (IC-k) vagy a CPU egészébe ágyazva dolgoznak ki a funkcionalitás és a hatékonyság érdekében."},{"prompt":"• Hogyan valósítható meg ROM segítségével egy kombinációs hálózat?","completion":"A ROM (Read-Only Memory – Csak olvasható memória) egy olyan nem illékony tárolóeszköz, amely előre meghatározott adatok tárolására szolgál, és ezek az adatok nem változtathatók meg (vagy csak nagyon korlátozottan) a normál működés során. Egy ROM segítségével megvalósíthatjuk a kombinációs logikai hálózatokat, mivel ezek a memóriák kimenetei meghatározhatók a bemeneti címek alapján. A következő lépéseket követhetjük egy kombinációs hálózat megvalósításához ROM használatával: 1. **Igazságtáblázat létrehozása:** Első lépésben hozzuk létre az igazságtáblázatot a megvalósítandó kombinációs logikai áramkörnek. Ebben a táblázatban rögzítjük a bemeneti címek és a kapcsolódó kimeneti értékek közötti kapcsolatot. 2. **A ROM programozása:** A ROM-ot úgy programozzuk, hogy a kívánt igazságtáblázatot tárolja. Mindegyik bemeneti kombináció egy egyedi címnek felel meg a ROM-ban, és minden címhez egy kimeneti érték van társítva, amely leképezi a kombinációs hálózat igazságtáblázatának kimenetét. 3. **Adresszálok kiosztása:** A bemenetek meghatározzák a ROM címtartományát, ahol minden lehetséges bemeneti kombináció egyedi címet kap. 4. **Kimeneti eszközök összekötése:** A ROM kimeneteire az adott logikai függvénytől függően lehet szükség további áramköri elemekre (például puffer vagy vezetőképesség-szabályozó) a kimeneti jelek megfelelő működéséhez. 5. **Tesztelés és hibakeresés:** Miután minden össze van kapcsolva, ellenőriznünk kell az áramkör működését a kombinációs logikai funkciónak megfelelően. A ROM használata egyszerűsítheti a kombinációs hálózatok hardveres megvalósítását, különösen akkor, ha a funkcionalitás nagyon összetett vagy ha sok különböző kimenetet kell kezelni. Egy másik előny, hogy a ROM programozható és újraprogramozható (ha az adott típus lehetővé teszi), így rugalmasságot nyújt az áramkör tervezésében és módosításában."},{"prompt":"Egy mondatban foglald össze a válaszod, röviden.","completion":"Egy ROM-ot kombinációs logikai hálózatként úgy használhatunk, hogy a memóriában tároljuk a logikai hálózat igazságtáblázatát, ahol a bemeneti címek a lehetséges logikai állapotokat jelképezik, és a hozzárendelt adattartalom a megfelelő logikai kimeneteket definiálja."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

( It's not the Who Theme, but might be a different work by a Radiophonic Workshop composer.)","completion":"Creating a theme tune for a science fiction show like \\"The Traveller\\" while drawing inspiration from composers like those from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop would involve channeling the pioneering electronic soundscapes they were known for. Given the show's premise involving adventures in time and space, the music would need to encapsulate a sense of wonder, mystery, and the vastness of the universe. Here's a description of what such a theme tune might sound like: **Introduction (0-10 seconds):** The piece might begin with a sparkling, ethereal electronic arpeggio, setting a tone of intrigue and otherworldliness. Think of a high-pitched, crystal-clear synthesizer sound that fades in from the silence of space, simulating stars twinkling or the rapid passage of time. **Main Theme (10-40 seconds):** A driving, pulsating sequence would follow, perhaps played on a Moog synthesizer or something similar, evoking a sense of travel and movement. This rhythm could be steady and upbeat, suggesting both the excitement and the constant motion of the Traveller's journey. Woven into this pulse would be sweeping synth lines, rising and falling like waves of energy rippling across the cosmos. This melodic element would aim to be memorable, portraying the Traveller's theme with a distinct musical motif that conveys her character's determination and courage. **Bridge (40-55 seconds):** A bridge section might feature more ambient sounds, such as electronic 'wind' or 'chimes', to give listeners a momentary breather and a sense of the vastness and solitude that can be found in the depths of space or the expanse of time. **Climax (55-70 seconds):** As the theme builds towards a climax, there could be a layering of electronic sounds to create a rich tapestry of sound. The harmony might grow more complex, with a minor key shift injecting a sense of mystery or danger that the Traveller might encounter. **Outro (70-90 seconds):** The outro would then bring back the main theme but perhaps in a lower register and slightly slower, fading out with an echo effect suggesting the Traveller moving on to her next adventure, the melody lingering as the stars drift by, indicating the continuity of the journey. **Signature Sound:** Throughout the piece, a distinctive sound or motif would repeat—possibly a synthesized bell or chime—that would become synonymous with 'The Traveller,' so the audience would immediately recognize the theme upon hearing just a few notes. This theme would be composed using vintage synthesizers and electronic equipment to give it an authentic ‘retro-futuristic’ vibe reminiscent of the '60s, '70s, and '80s sci-fi soundtracks, while also being catchy and modern enough to appeal to contemporary audiences."},{"prompt":"I know exactly which theme \\"The Traveller\\" had in the early 80 - Peteter Howell - \\"The Astronauts\\" played slightly faster (about 120%) faster.. :) I am trying to think what might have worked for the late 80's (Lansbury) and 1970s (Rigg & Aggutter), The original 60's Traveller theme is still by Delia Berbyshire (maybe with Daphne Oram assisting)..","completion":"The evolution of the theme for \\"The Traveller\\" across different eras would have reflected the changing styles in music production as well as the shifting cultural context of each decade. Let's imagine how this theme might have adapted through these periods: **1960s (\\"The Traveller\\" original theme by Delia Derbyshire with Daphne Oram):** For the original 1960s theme, we'd expect a pioneering electronic soundscape, echoing the work found on the \\"Doctor Who\\" theme. Derbyshire and Oram, both influential in the Radiophonic Workshop, would likely create a theme featuring a tapestry of oscillators, filtered white noise, and tape manipulation. It would be rich in experimental timbres and might incorporate sounds reminiscent of space travel and the ethereal, with a hypnotic and slightly eerie quality. **1970s (\\"The Traveller\\" with Rigg & Agutter):** By the 1970s, synthesizers like the Minimoog and the ARP Odyssey were becoming more common in music production. The theme might have evolved to include the warmer, analog sounds of these instruments, which could provide a thicker, more melodic line, resonating with the sci-fi/fantasy aesthetics of the time. Paddy Kingsland could have been a possible composer for this era, as someone who was able to blend the electronic with the organic. The theme would likely be more harmonically rich and feature more traditional musical structures (verse-chorus), while still maintaining the otherworldly ambiance. **Late 1980s (Lansbury era):** For the late 1980s version of \\"The Traveller\\" theme, we'd be entering the era of digital synthesis and sampling. The music might shift to include more cinematic elements, given the influence of film scores on TV themes during the period. It could also have a punchy bass line and sharper synth leads, reflecting the pop music trends of the time. A composer like Elizabeth Parker could have provided a theme that maintains the original's adventurous spirit but introduces smoother, digital textures and a possibly broader dynamic range, incorporating elements like artificial choirs and digital orchestral hits. **Late 1980s (Alternative approach):** Alternatively, for a late 1980s \\"The Traveller\\" theme with a different feel, Mark Ayres, another Radiophonic Workshop composer, could have brought in more dramatic elements and complex synthesis. The music might feature the Yamaha DX7's hallmark FM synthesis sounds for a bell-like quality, digital pads for atmospheric backgrounds, and perhaps gated reverb on the drums – a production technique notably used in the 80s to give a spacious and impactful sound to percussion. As we reimagine these themes across different eras, it's clear that each composer would bring their unique touch, informed by the technology and musical styles of the day, while maintaining the essence of adventure and mystery that embodies \\"The Traveller.\\""},{"prompt":"An alternate late 70's version would have sounded like a Prog rock concept (Think Pink Floyd, with ticking clocks moprhing into synths..)","completion":"For an alternate late '70s version of \\"The Traveller\\" theme inspired by progressive rock, we could envision a blend of the complex structures typical of prog rock with the emerging electronic sounds of the era. **Progressive Conceptualization:** The new theme might open with ambient sound effects, akin to Pink Floyd's \\"Time,\\" commencing with ticking clocks that represent time travel. The clocks could be layered with otherworldly sound effects, like the whirring of machinery or the hum of a spaceship's engine, created using tape loops or early electronic instruments. **Introduction (0-20 seconds):** A foreboding, low-frequency synth pad fades in, joined by a series of clock-like sounds morphing into a rhythmic pattern. This sets a tense and mysterious mood as you're transported into The Traveller's realm. **Build-Up (20-40 seconds):** The rhythmic ticking then transitions into an early drum machine or a live drum set, capturing a soft, yet complex rhythm that pushes the theme forward. An electric bass with a melodic line might enter, playing a repetitive motif that adds a sense of urgency and forward motion. **Main Theme (40-80 seconds):** As the rhythm section settles in, a virtuosic keyboard solo, inspired by the likes of Rick Wright or Keith Emerson, dives into the mix with soaring leads on a Minimoog or a Mellotron, lending a sweeping, cosmic flavor. **Prog Rock Development (80-120 seconds):** Electric guitars with a clean echo would cut through the mix, delivering a David Gilmour-inspired solo with a sustained, singing tone. The music might have intricate time signature changes, a characteristic of prog rock, evoking the non-linear nature of time travel. **Climactic Synthesis (120-150 seconds):** The piece would build to a climax with a full band sound, incorporating both the rock ensemble and the synthesized elements, leading to an elaborate musical passage that conveys the epic scope of the Traveller's adventures. **Outro (150-180 seconds):** For the conclusion, themes would slowly deconstruct, returning to the ticking clocks and fading synth lines, leaving the listener with an aura of mystery and an echo of existential wonder. **Epilogue:** In the final moments, a gentle acoustic guitar or a solo piano could introduce a softer, reflective melody, perhaps alluding to the human or emotional dimension of The Traveller's experiences, before finally dissolving into the ethereal soundscape from whence it began. Composed with the ambition and grandiosity typical of progressive rock, yet infused with the futurism of space-age synthesis, this alternate late '70s theme for \\"The Traveller\\" would not just signal the start of an episode but serve as a compelling musical journey in its own

Word has come through the grapevine that Disney is set to rebrand its Disney XD channels across Europe to Jetix, and the move has set the online forums ablaze with speculation, excitement, and a hint of wonder. As millennials might remember, Jetix was the iconic brand name associated with an era of action-packed cartoons and adrenaline-filled adventures that shaped the afterschool routine of the early to mid-2000s. With Disney turning its focus to bolster the digital fortress that is its streaming service, it’s clear they’re granting their linear channels the freedom to delve into their rich TV history. In an official statement announcing the change, Disney confirmed that the shift towards streaming would not mean the end of their commitment to cable entertainment. Instead, it signifies a transformation, a revival of a brand beloved by millions – Jetix, the name that once represented the epicenter of children’s action television. With the flux of emotions, there’s a sense of relief for fans to know that some cornerstones of Disney XD are sticking around. “Phineas and Ferb” and “Gravity Falls” will remain to provide solidity during this period of change. These shows encapsulate that ingenious blend of humor, heart, and creativity that we’ve come to expect from Disney, serving as a comforting bridge between the old and the new. However, this isn’t just a game of musical chairs with channel names; there’s genuinely fresh content on the horizon. New shows are being teased, yet details remain tantalizingly scarce. Promises of innovative animation styles, boundary-pushing storytelling, and modern takes on classic themes have piqued our curiosities. There’s talk of a series that delves into mythology, another that explores futuristic sports, and even a whisper of a Jetix-original superhero saga. For those who grew up with the original Jetix, you’ll be pleased to hear that some of your old favorites are set to make a comeback. Dust off those memories of “Ōban Star-Racers,” “W.I.T.C.H.,” and “Pucca,” because they’re slated for reruns. These shows will stand alongside the new, blending a tapestry of past and present. The strategy is apparent: while Disney XD’s kid-centric ethos will undoubtedly evolve, the core of what made Jetix resonate with viewers worldwide is set to return. Innovation will walk hand in hand with nostalgia, providing a space for a new generation to embrace these characters and stories, while giving the older crowd a taste of yesteryear. As Disney increases its push into the streaming sector, announcing content galore for its on-demand platforms, the introduction of Jetix as a linear channel seems to go against the digital grain. Yet, perhaps it highlights an understanding that there’s still value in the linear viewing experience – the joy of scheduled programming, the thrill of catching your favorite show at its designated time slot, and the shared cultural moment that ensues. In essence, Disney’s shift with the Jetix rebirth seems to acknowledge that in an age of binge-watching and algorithm-driven suggestions, there’s an inherent charm and simplicity in the traditional TV format that resonates with viewers both young and old. So, here’s to Jetix 2.0 – may your phoenix-like rise from the ashes of Disney XD bring memories, excitement, and a whole new era of tales that will be spoken of for years to come! Keep your remotes ready, Europe. Jetix is back, and it’s time to relive the adventure. Write a follow up when the transition ends, 2 more Jetix classics make a comeback, but we have to sacrifice Phineas and Ferb and Gravity Falls, Viewers of those shows are asked to go to Disney+ to continue watching them","completion":"Title: Jetix Resurgence Marks End of an Era for Disney XD: Embracing Classics at the Expense of Modern Staples It's been several months since the whispers and speculation turned into a palpable reality: Disney XD channels across Europe transformed, taking on the mantle of Jetix once more. A nostalgia-fueled wave swept over fans old and new as Jetix reclaimed its place in the television landscape, a callback to the high-octane energy and spirited narratives that once ruled the airwaves. Today, as the dust settles on this corporate metamorphosis, audiences behold a lineup that is both familiar and filled with promise. There's a buzz of anticipation for the innovation and revival that Jetix 2.0 heralds. New shows with cutting-edge animation and daring stories have been filtering onto the screen, fulfilling the promise made during the rebrand's announcement. With this new beginning, however, comes a moment of departure. In a surprising turn of events, Disney has announced that fan favorites “Phineas and Ferb” and “Gravity Falls” will be leaving the Jetix schedule, a move that has caused both heartache and surprise. The decision sends a clear message: Jetix is reclaiming its identity as a haven for pure action and adventure, stepping away from the quirky, genre-blending tales these shows represent. Viewers who came of age with the witty inventions of Phineas and Ferb or delved into the supernatural mysteries of Gravity Falls are being gently pointed towards Disney+, where their beloved series will still be available for streaming. The pivot to Disney’s on-demand platform for these shows signifies a strategic allocation of content, steering users towards the growing digital empire. But while this strategic \\"sacrifice\\" may dishearten some, Jetix softens the blow with the return of two additional classics from its golden era. As if pulling characters out of a beloved storybook, “Galactik Football” and “Monster Buster Club” resurface, reconnecting audiences with more slices of the past. The familiar tales, rich with thematic depth and nostalgic allure, stand ready to infuse the current generation with the same excitement they brought years ago. The diverging fates of such shows highlight the evolving nature of entertainment consumption. Disney's recognition that certain stories thrive better in an on-demand environment, while others fit the traditional linear TV model, suggests a nuanced approach to audience engagement and content delivery. As Jetix affirms its focus on action and legacy, it does more than paying homage to its roots; it reshapes the modern viewing experience and redefines what a children’s channel can be. In this rebirth, Jetix not only promises a blast from the past but offers an untapped storefront of creativity and adventure for new fans to discover. The return of Jetix is, in many ways, a balance of loss and gain, a reminder that the evolution of media can be both bittersweet and exciting. Europe's schedules may no longer feature the antics of two beloved animated series, but in exchange, viewers across the continent gain a renewed space that celebrates the spirit of adventure that Jetix always championed. Jetix 2.0 stands poised on the brink of greatness, beckoning with the exhilarating essence of youth and the uncharted territory of imagination. And though the transition has reshuffled the deck, fans old and new are likely to agree that the return of Jetix is, in itself, an adventure worth tuning in for."},{"prompt":"Hoeffding Random Forest algorithm with Hoeffding Tree Pruning (HTP) regularization","completion":"The Hoeffding Random Forest is an adaptation of the traditional Random Forest algorithm for streaming data, and it uses the Hoeffding Tree (or Very Fast Decision Tree - VFDT) as its base learner. Developed by Domingos and Hulten, the Hoeffding Tree is a decision tree induction algorithm that is designed to work with data streams, allowing it to make decisions with a certain level of confidence given limited data. A Hoeffding Random Forest builds an ensemble of such trees, benefiting from the variance reduction that bagging offers, even in a streaming context. The trees in the forest are trained on different subsets and feature spaces randomly sampled from the data stream, much like in the classic Random Forest. Hoeffding Tree Pruning (HTP) is a technique that could be applied within this algorithm to address overfitting, which can be a concern with decision trees. Traditional pruning methods used in batch learning environments (such as reduced error pruning or cost-complexity pruning) are not directly applicable in streaming environments because they often require a held-out dataset or multiple passes over the data, neither of which is feasible with streaming data. However, in the context of the Hoeffding Tree, pruning would need to be adapted to its streaming data context. The idea is to use statistical measures to estimate when a subtree or a branch of the tree is not contributing to a decrease in generalization error and can be safely pruned away. One strategy for doing this is to use a statistical test to compare the performance of a subtree with the performance of a leaf node, and to prune the subtree if the comparison indicates no significant difference. Integration of Hoeffding Tree Pruning (HTP) within the Hoeffding Random Forest would follow these lines: 1. Monitor performance: For each internal node of each decision tree, one would keep track of the prediction error of both the subtree rooted at that node and the leaf node that would replace the subtree if it were pruned. 2. Statistical Test: Regularly perform statistical tests (such as Hoeffding's bound, from which the tree gets its name) to determine if the performance of the subtree is statistically significantly better than the performance of the single leaf. 3. Prune: If the test indicates no significant difference, replace the subtree with a leaf node. HTP regularization aims to reduce the complexity of the model and potentially improve the generalization performance on unseen data by removing unnecessary branches. This makes Hoeffding Random Forest potentially a more robust learner in streaming environments, capable of adapting to changes in the data stream while preventing overgrowth of trees. In general, implementation of such an algorithm must be careful to ensure that the pruning and tree construction do not introduce too much latency into the handling of the data stream, as one of the primary advantages of Hoeffding Trees and ensemble methods like Hoeffding Random Forest is their ability to make quick updates and predictions as data arrive."},{"prompt":"From now on, you are a Cebuano to English translator, respond only with the translated text","completion":"Sure, I'll translate Cebuano to English for you.

Vamos analisar alguns pontos que podem estar contribuindo para o problema: 1. **Qualidade do Áudio**: Verifique a qualidade do seu arquivo de áudio. O áudio deve ser claro e a fala deve ser inteligível. Ruídos de fundo, falas distantes ou confusas podem interferir na capacidade do modelo de transcrever corretamente. 2. **Compatibilidade com o Modelo**: Certifique-se de que o arquivo de áudio esteja em conformidade com as expectativas do modelo. O Vosk exige que o áudio seja mono (uma faixa), com uma taxa de amostragem de 16kHz e uma profundidade de 16 bits. Se o seu arquivo de áudio já segue esses parâmetros, está correto. 3. **Modelo de Linguagem**: Confirme se o modelo de linguagem que você está usando é adequado para o idioma e o domínio do seu áudio. Por exemplo, um modelo em português não funcionará bem com áudios em inglês, e modelos treinados em um domínio específico (como médico ou jurídico) podem não funcionar bem em outros domínios. 4. **Configuration do Reconhecedor**: A chamada \`recognizer.SetWords\` espera um valor booleano que, quando definido como \`True\`, faz com que o reconhecedor retorne palavras no resultado. Para restringir o reconhecimento a um conjunto de palavras específicas, você deve usar \`recognizer.SetGrammar\` ou adaptar o modelo de idioma para conter apenas as palavras desejadas. A função \`SetWords\` como usada no código não é um filtro de palavras. 5. **Verificação de Resultados**: O reconhecedor pode fornecer resultados parciais e finais. No seu loop, você está chamando \`recognizer.Result()\`, que retorna um resultado final. Pode ser útil também verificar \`recognizer.PartialResult()\` para ver se está obtendo alguma saída parcial. 6. **Logs de Depuração**: Os logs mostram que o Vosk está carregando os recursos do modelo com sucesso. Porém, os logs normalmente não incluem as transcrições de áudio. Verifique se o código que imprime a transcrição (o \`print\` dentro do loop) está sendo alcançado e se está havendo algum resultado no \`resultados_json\`. Aqui está um trecho modificado para verificar os resultados parciais: \`\`\`python # ... while True: data = wf.readframes(4000) if len(data) == 0: break if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data): resultados = recognizer.Result() else: resultados = recognizer.PartialResult() resultados_json = json.loads(resultados) print(resultados_json.get(\\"text\\", \\"\\")) \`\`\` Se mesmo após estas verificações você não estiver obtendo resultados esperados, isso pode indicar que os dados do áudio não são adequados para o modelo ou que pode haver algum problema com a gravação ou formato do áudio."},{"prompt":"Configuration do Reconhecedor: A chamada recognizer.SetWords espera um valor booleano que, quando definido como True, faz com que o reconhecedor retorne palavras no resultado.

A função SetWords como usada no código não é um filtro de palavras.Como faço?","completion":"Peço desculpa pela confusão anterior. No Vosk, você realmente está correto em usar \`SetWords()\` para informar ao reconhecedor que você deseja ver as palavras no resultado. No entanto, \`SetWords()\` não é usado para limitar o dicionário reconhecedor a um conjunto específico de palavras. Ele simplesmente ativa a opção para retornar as palavras reconhecidas na transcrição. Para limitar o reconhecimento a um conjunto específico de palavras, você precisa criar uma gramática ou um modelo de linguagem (Language Model) que contenha apenas as palavras que você deseja reconhecer. Isso geralmente é feito durante o processo de treinamento do modelo ou ajustando os arquivos FST (Finite State Transducer) no modelo. No entanto, Vosk tem uma funcionalidade de gramática simples que permite especificar um pequeno conjunto de frases ou palavras para reconhecimento. O processo básico para fazer isso é: 1. Crie uma gramática no formato de json e defina como uma string. 2. Converta essa string de gramática para um formato que o Vosk reconhece (GraFST). 3. Defina esta gramática no reconhecedor antes do início do reconhecimento. Aqui está um exemplo de como você poderia fazer isso usando a API do Vosk: \`\`\`python import vosk import sys import wave import json # Carregar o modelo model_path = \\"modelof\\" model = vosk.Model(model_path) # Criar uma gramática grammar = { \\"fala\\" : [ \\"[sim não stop muito um dois três seis cinco dois sete tereza três treze voleibol]\\" ] } grammar_str = json.dumps(grammar) # Usar a gramática no reconhecedor with wave.open(\\"command_seis_1704130551.wav\\", \\"rb\\") as wf: if wf.getnchannels() != 1 or wf.getsampwidth() != 2 or wf.getframerate() != 16000: print(\\"O arquivo de áudio deve ser WAV com uma única faixa (mono), 16 bits e 16 kHz.\\") sys.exit(1) recognizer = vosk.KaldiRecognizer(model, wf.getframerate()) recognizer.SetWords(True) recognizer.SetGrammar(\\"fala\\", grammar_str) # Definir a gramática no reconhecedor while True: data = wf.readframes(4000) if len(data) == 0: break if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data): resultados = recognizer.Result() resultados_json = json.loads(resultados) print(resultados_json.get(\\"text\\", \\"\\")) \`\`\` Por favor, note que a gramática está escrita na notação de lista de json, onde as palavras estão entre colchetes. O nome \`fala\` é o nome da gramática e é referenciado quando você define a gramática no reconhecedor. Aviso: Este exemplo assume que o reconhecimento de frases curtas e a limitação a palavras específicas é suportado pela versão do Vosk que você está usando.

Errei no método \`SetGrammar()\`, pois não é suportado diretamente na biblioteca Vosk desta forma. A modificação de gramáticas em tempo de execução dessa maneira é uma característica complexa que, na verdade, não é oferecida pela maioria dos motores de reconhecimento de voz. A personalização de modelagem para reconhecer somente um conjunto limitado de palavras geralmente requer ajustes no próprio modelo antes da distribuição e não dinamicamente durante a execução. Se deseja reconhecer apenas um conjunto específico de palavras, você pode criar uma gramática específica ou um modelo de linguagem durante o treinamento do modelo. Outra alternativa, se desejar proceder com um filtro básico (pós-processamento), é fazer uma verificação das palavras reconhecidas e filtrá-las de acordo com sua lista de palavras desejada após receber os resultados do reconhecimento. Veja um exemplo de como fazer esse pós-processamento: \`\`\`python # ...

[Código para inicialização do modelo e abertura do arquivo de áudio] while True: data = wf.readframes(4000) if len(data) == 0: break if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data): resultados = recognizer.Result() resultados_json = json.loads(resultados) # Separa as palavras reconhecidas por espaços recognized_words = resultados_json.get(\\"text\\", \\"\\").split() # Filtra somente as palavras permitidas filtered_words = [word for word in recognized_words if word in allowed_words] print(' '.join(filtered_words)) \`\`\` Este não é um método perfeito e não oferece a mesma precisão que a limitação do reconhecimento à um conjunto de palavras durante o treinamento do modelo, mas pode servir como uma solução rápida para casos mais simples. Caso você tenha a intenção de implementar um reconhecimento de palavras altamente restrito e personalizado, você pode querer explorar a documentação da Vosk e comunidade para criar um modelo de reconhecimento de voz específico ou adaptar um modelo existente às suas necessidades específicas."},{"prompt":"em import vosk import sys import wave import json # Importe o módulo json # Instale o Vosk via pip se ainda não estiver instalado # pip install vosk # Carregar o modelo (verifique se o modelo está correto e se o caminho está especificado corretamente) model_path = “C:meuvosk wav2vec funcionammodelpt” model = vosk.Model(model_path) # Onde ‘hello.wav’ é um arquivo de aúdio em inglês com uma amostragem de 16kHz with wave.open(“C:meuvosk wav2vec funcionamcommand_um_1702261951.wav”, “rb”) as wf: if wf.getnchannels() != 1 or wf.getsampwidth() != 2 or wf.getframerate() != 16000: print(“O arquivo de áudio deve ser WAV com uma única faixa (mono), 16 bits e 16 kHz.”) sys.exit(1) recognizer = vosk.KaldiRecognizer(model, wf.getframerate()) recognizer.SetWords(True) # Limite o reconhecimento para um conjunto específico de palavras #recognizer.SetWords([“yes”, “no”, “stop”, “go”, “left”, “right”, “on”, “off”, …]) recognizer.SetWords([“sim”, “não”, “stop”, “muito”, “um”, “dois”, “três”, “seis”]) while True: data = wf.readframes(4000) if len(data) == 0: break if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data): resultados = recognizer.Result() resultados_json = json.loads(resultados) # Processamento do resultado print(resultados_json.get(“text”, “”)) isto: recognizer.SetWords([“sim”, “não”, “stop”, “muito”, “um”, “dois”, “três”, “seis”]) não funciona mas também não produz erro por quê?","completion":"A chamada \`recognizer.SetWords(True)\` no código Vosk é usada para dizer ao reconhecedor que você deseja receber as palavras no resultado do reconhecimento, juntamente com a confiança dessas palavras. No entanto, é importante notar que essa chamada não limita o reconhecimento a um conjunto específico de palavras. Em vez disso, ela apenas ativa a opção para incluir as palavras no resultado JSON. A linha \`recognizer.SetWords([...])\`, conforme você incluiu, não tem efeito no Vosk, pois o método \`SetWords\` espera um único argumento booleano (\`True\` ou \`False\`), e não uma lista de palavras. O Vosk não possui funcionalidade built-in para restringir o reconhecimento a um conjunto pré-definido de palavras diretamente através desse método. Portanto, quando você tenta passar uma lista de palavras para o \`SetWords\`, o Vosk ignora essa chamada, porque a assinatura do método não corresponde ao que é esperado. O Vosk não gera um erro nesse caso porque é uma chamada de método inválida que é simplesmente descartada pela implementação da API. Se você deseja limitar o reconhecimento a específicas palavras, você terá que fazer isso manualmente após receber a transcrição completa, ou utilizar um modelo que tenha sido especificamente treinado para reconhecer apenas um conjunto limitado de palavras ou frases. Para realizar um filtro básico das palavras reconhecidas usando pós-processamento, você poderia fazer algo assim: \`\`\`python # ...[seu código prévio]... # Define uma lista de palavras permitidas allowed_words = {\\"sim\\", \\"não\\", \\"stop\\", \\"muito\\", \\"um\\", \\"dois\\", \\"três\\", \\"seis\\"} while True: data = wf.readframes(4000) if len(data) == 0: break if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data): resultados = recognizer.Result() resultados_json = json.loads(resultados) text = resultados_json.get(\\"text\\", \\"\\") # Filtra palavras que não estão na lista permitida filtered_text = ' '.join(word for word in text.split() if word in allowed_words) # Processamento do resultado com palavras filtradas print(filtered_text) \`\`\` Este trecho de código irá extrair somente as palavras da transcrição que coincidem com as palavras na lista \`allowed_words\`. Desta forma, você limita o resultado do reconhecimento às palavras de interesse após a transcrição ter sido gerada."},{"prompt":"Até algum tempo atrás, o estado de arte no reconhecimento de voz do Facebook era o wav2vec2 recentemente surgiu o seamless_m4t. Será que aqui há alguma adaptação ao reconhecimento sem fazer treino, isto é, com palavras novas que surgem ou que se queiram alterar?","completion":"O wav2vec 2.0, desenvolvido pelo Facebook AI (agora Meta AI), certamente tem sido um dos modelos de estado da arte em termos de reconhecimento automático de fala (ASR). Ele é um modelo pré-treinado em grande escala que aprende representações poderosas de áudio que podem ser adaptadas para reconhecimento de fala com poucos dados rotulados, o que é conhecido como fine-tuning. Quanto ao \\"seamless_m4t\\" que você mencionou, não há informações suficientes disponíveis publicamente sobre essa tecnologia, até a data da minha última atualização (Knowledge cutoff: 2023), para oferecer uma resposta específica. É possível que se refira a uma evolução ou nova metodologia na área de reconhecimento de fala, mas sem mais informações é difícil fazer uma avaliação precisa. Seria necessário mais contexto ou um nome exato para a ferramenta ou técnica para fornecer detalhes relevantes. No entanto, voltando aos modelos como wav2vec 2.0 e outros modelos de reconhecimento de fala de alto desempenho, eles normalmente permitem a adaptação a novas palavras ou domínios através de uma etapa de fine-tuning. Isso envolve re-treinar o modelo em um conjunto específico de dados de áudio que contenha as novas palavras ou o domínio de interesse. Essencialmente, o fine-tuning ajusta os pesos do modelo treinado a partir de um modelo pré-existente para melhor lidar com as peculiaridades do novo conjunto de dados. Se você estiver procurando por uma maneira de usar modelos como o wav2vec 2.0 para reconhecer palavras ou frases que não estavam presentes no conjunto de dados original de treinamento, você terá algumas opções: 1. **Fine-tuning com Dados Específicos**: Se os dados de transcrição contiverem as novas palavras, o modelo pode ser refinado para reconhecê-las. 2. **Adição de um Novo Layer de Decodificação**: Para palavras fora do vocabulário, algumas abordagens adicionam um novo layer de decodificação treinável que pode ser adaptado para reconhecer novas palavras. 3. **Modelos End-to-End com Decodificadores Externos**: Modelos end-to-end (E2E) podem ser combinados com decodificadores de linguagem externos que podem ser atualizados ou expandidos para incluir novas palavras. 4. **Treinamento de Zero-shot**: Alguns modelos recentes exploram a habilidade de reconhecer palavras fora do vocabulário sem a necessidade direta de re-treinamento, mas isso é geralmente muito mais desafiador e ainda é um tópico de pesquisa. Em resumo, a introdução de novas palavras em modelos pré-treinados de reconhecimento de fala geralmente requer algum nível de adaptação ou treinamento, embora os métodos e a quantidade de dados necessários para isso possam variar significativamente entre os diferentes modelos e abordagens de ASR."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

There’s one particular problematic 3 year old girl called Lily who unknowingly has the mysterious power to regress the age of others and make her grow up faster, as just a month ago she was just 1 year old, but she absorbed the age from some of the toddler orphans and they regressed back into babies, forgot words and have to be in diapers again. Can Sapphire manage to watch over Lily, keep her away from regressing the other kids, and avoid regressing herself? and if not, just how young will she get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether Sapphire manages to resist Lily’s powers, and if she can’t, by how much she regresses and by how much Lily grows in return. The more she regresses, the more difficult it’d be for her to control Lily and be respected by the other orphans at the orphanage (kids there are up to age 12) and be reliable in the eyes of the headmistress. If Lily grows up to the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers, which gives her a bonus to them, and will seek to regress Sapphire intentionally so she herself can grow up and become a teenager. Tell me when to roll and I’ll tell you the result of my rolls. Regressing will give Sapphire penalties to her future rolls. Have a “system of trust” that concerns how various parties at the orphanage deem Sapphire and how reliable and capable she is, and depends on rolls and actions, Sapphire can increase or decrease her worth in the eyes of said parties. The parties are: Lily; the headmistress; the younger orphanage kids; the older orphanage kids. Low and high trust will give her penalties and bonuses in specific rolls.","completion":"All right, let’s begin the roleplay scenario. As Sapphire steps into the familiar yet somewhat changed environment of the orphanage, her eyes immediately find the small figure of Lily, the 3-year-old girl sitting in the playroom, surrounded by toys and a couple of toddlers wearing oversized diapers. Sapphire remembers the little girl as a baby, barely able to crawl, but now she clearly stands and moves with the confidence of a child past the toddler stage. The headmistress, a kind but weary woman named Ms. Bowman, approaches Sapphire with a mixture of relief and worry in her eyes. “Sapphire, you’ve come at the right time,” she says, glancing towards Lily. “Her power is becoming more evident, and we need to find a way to control it before any other children are affected.” Sapphire’s role is clear: she must watch over Lily, prevent her from inadvertently using her age-regressing powers on the other children or herself, and somehow maintain a sense of normalcy in the orphanage. **Trust System: Initial Setup** - Lily's trust: Neutral - Headmistress's trust: High (Sapphire grew up here and is seen as capable) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Neutral (They're too young to have a solid opinion) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Neutral (Sapphire needs to earn their respect) Sapphire will have to navigate the day carefully, attending to her duties and interacting with Lily and the other children to build trust. **First Interaction** Sapphire decides to approach Lily and engage her in play, hoping to build rapport and establish a caring presence to prevent an incident. (Roll a d20 for a \\"Play with Lily\\" interaction. High roll means successfully engaging Lily with a positive outcome, low roll could have consequences such as a minor age regression incident.) **The Headmistress Task** Meanwhile, the headmistress takes Sapphire aside and asks her to keep Lily in her sight at all times, not only for the safety of the others but also for Sapphire herself. Ms. Bowman also implies that Sapphire’s position in the orphanage and her future responsibilities could depend on how well she handles Lily. Sapphire will have to check on the other children, help with chores, and monitor Lily's interactions. **Daily Challenges** Sapphire will encounter several situations throughout the day that require d20 rolls: 1. Organizing activities for the children (affects trust with older kids). 2. Handling mealtime and ensuring Lily eats without causing stress (affects trust with younger kids). 3. Personal interactions with Lily to build trust (critical for preventing intentional age regression once Lily gains awareness). **Incidents with Lily** Whenever Lily is involved in a stressful situation or is feeling strong emotions, Sapphire will have to roll to prevent an age-regressing incident (This will: Affect trust levels with all parties depending on the outcome, and determine if and by how much Sapphire regresses) Sapphire's penalties or bonuses from regression will apply to future rolls accordingly. A critical failure could result in a notable regression, while minor missteps could lead to small age decreases. Now, whenever you're ready, roll for Sapphire's first \\"Play with Lily\\" interaction and we will proceed from there."},{"prompt":"3","completion":"With a roll of 3, Sapphire's initial attempt to engage Lily in play doesn't go as smoothly as she hoped. As she sits down next to Lily, trying to draw her into a simple game of blocks, Lily appears disinterested and slightly agitated. The other children watch warily, sensing the tension. Lily tosses a block towards another child, and in the blink of an eye, that child's features seem to blur and soften. The child lets out a wail, now noticeably younger, reduced to an infantile state – a clear indication of Lily's powers at work. **Consequences:** - Lily's trust: Unchanged (She is too young to truly understand Sapphire’s intention) - Headmistress's trust: Slightly Decreased (Sapphire hasn't managed the situation well) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Decreased (They're afraid after witnessing the regression) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Unchanged (They are cautious of the newcomer's abilities) **Age Regression Incident:** Sapphire feels a strange wave of dizziness as Lily's powers ripple through the room, but she tries to maintain her composure. There's no avoiding it, though—affecting a roll for her own resistance. Please roll a d20 to determine if Sapphire resists the regressive power Lily inadvertently unleashed, and by how much she's affected. A high roll signifies resistance, while a low roll will determine the degree of her regression."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"With a roll of 4, Sapphire feels a light-headedness wash over her, her vision blurring momentarily. As she regains her focus, she realizes with a shock that the room seems larger, the furniture taller. Her clothes hang more loosely around her body; even her voice sounds different -- higher, with a childlike timbre. Sapphire has been affected by Lily's powers, regressing in age. She must now determine her new age. For this, she will roll another d20, and the result will subtract years from her current age of 17. Please roll the d20 to determine the extent of Sapphire's regression. The lower the number, the younger she will become."},{"prompt":"17","completion":"A roll of 17 signifies that Sapphire regresses by 17 years, which fundamentally cannot happen since she would cease to exist. This is likely an indication of the extreme outcome being averted, or a misinterpretation of the roll. Given that the original intention was not to completely nullify Sapphire's existence, let's assume there was a degree of natural resistance to Lily's power. For narrative coherence, let us interpret the roll of 17 as a slight grace under duress: Sapphire manages to cling onto the very edge of her teenage years but still regresses significantly. Considering that a total regression is not plausible, we can say that the roll indicates a resistance to the full force of Lily's powers. We must decide on a reasonable regression that would still allow the story to progress. Let's suppose that instead of regressing the full 17 years, Sapphire only regresses to some extent. Using the high roll as an indicator of resistance, Sapphire regresses four years, making her 13 years old and keeping her within the bounds of adolescence. **Sapphire's New Situation:** - Current age: 13 - Lily's trust: Unchanged (She doesn't comprehend her own powers) - Headmistress's trust: Further Decreased (Concern for Sapphire’s well-being and her capability to handle Lily) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Decreased (They are wary and confused by the sudden change) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Decreased (They are less likely to respect someone closer to their own age) **Penalties:** - Sapphire now faces a penalty with her next sets of rolls due to her younger age and reduced physical size and authority. Next, Sapphire must try to contain the situation without alarming the other children or drawing attention to her regression. She'll need to reassure the younger kids, notify the headmistress discreetly, and find a way to prevent Lily from causing any further incidents. It’s crucial now for Sapphire to establish control and to reassert herself among the children. Let's do a “Calm the Children” check to see if Sapphire can stabilize the situation (Roll a d20). Remember, due to Sapphire's age regression, she might face additional challenges in gaining the children's trust and cooperation."},{"prompt":"asking for a do-over on the last roll. if a d20 can't determine the extent of the regression because it has numbers 17 and up, then we need to use a different dice for this particular roll","completion":"Understood, I apologize for the confusion. Let's reframe the method to determine the extent of Sapphire's regression in a way that avoids replication of her entire age span. Since Sapphire is 17 years old, we will use a d12 for this regression roll. This die size will ensure that she cannot regress more than 12 years at once, avoiding any nonsensical outcomes. Please roll a d12 instead, and the number you roll will be the number of years Sapphire regresses by. Keep in mind, the higher the number, the younger Sapphire becomes, with significant repercussions for her ability to manage the situation and her standing with the other characters in the orphanage."},{"prompt":"3","completion":"With a roll of 3 on the d12, Sapphire finds herself regressing by 3 years, leaving her at 14 years old. Although she's still in her teens, the difference in physical stature, emotional maturity, and perceived authority has immediate consequences. **Sapphire's Current Situation:** - Current age: 14 - Lily's trust: Unchanged (Still unaware of the impact of her actions) - Headmistress's trust: Decreased (Worried about Sapphire's ability to manage) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Decreased (Confused and a bit frightened by the changes) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Seriously Decreased (Challenge to view Sapphire as an authority figure) **New Penalties and Challenges:** - Sapphire has decreased physical presence, which may influence interactions with older kids. - She may struggle with maintaining authority and keeping Lily in check. - Emotional regulation might be harder due to the regression to early adolescence. Despite the reduction in years, Sapphire's memories and knowledge of her 17-year-old self remain intact, giving her an advantage in terms of experience and understanding of her situation. However, the importance of regaining the trust of those around her is now even more critical. **Next Steps:** Sapphire needs to manage this delicate situation with finesse. 1. Calm the Younger Children: Sapphire will try to comfort the younger children, reassuring them that everything is okay. We will need a roll to determine her success in calming them down. 2. Communicate with the Headmistress: She'll need to use her remaining authority and maturity to explain the situation discreetly to Ms. Bowman without causing further concern. Please roll a d20 for a \\"Calm the Younger Children\\" check, factoring in the penalties due to her current state. We'll also need another roll later for how effectively she communicates with the headmistress."},{"prompt":"14","completion":"With a roll of 14, Sapphire manages to keep her composure despite the personal upheaval she has just experienced. Drawing on her familiarity with the orphanage and the younger ones’ need for comfort, she gathers the young kids around and begins to tell a story—a favorite pastime she recalls from her own childhood in the orphanage. The heartfelt story distracts the scared younger children, drawing their attention away from their own anxieties and onto Sapphire's soothing voice. **Updated Trust Levels:** - Lily's trust: Unchanged (She is engrossed in the story, not realizing she’s the cause) - Headmistress's trust: Slightly Increased (Sapphire is showing capability despite adversity) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Increased (They are comforted by Sapphire's familiar presence) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Unchanged (They did not witness Sapphire's story-telling) Managing to calm the younger children, Sapphire helps stabilize the orphanage environment temporarily. Witnessing this, some of the staff members and children, including older kids who overhear the story, might begin to see her not just as an older sister figure, but as someone demonstrating leadership under stress—a trait that could work in her favor to regain their trust. **Next Move:** It's now critical for Sapphire to communicate what happened to the headmistress without raising more alarm or instability among the rest of the orphanage. She must also advocate for herself, proving she's still capable of handling Lily and the challenges that come with the girl’s mysterious power. Please roll a d20 to determine how effectively Sapphire conveys the incident to Ms. Bowman, taking into account the new dynamics of her youth, but also her resolve to handle the situation."},{"prompt":"13","completion":"With a roll of 13, Sapphire is able to convey the situation to the headmistress, Ms. Bowman, with a moderate level of clarity and confidence. The headmistress listens intently, concern etched on her face as Sapphire explains the recent event and its result. While Ms. Bowman is initially taken aback by Sapphire's sudden change in appearance, she recognizes the gravity of the circumstance and appreciates Sapphire’s attempt at handling things maturely despite her regression. **Trust Levels Adjustment:** - Headmistress's trust: Increased (Sapphire has managed to retain her composure and articulate the incident well) - Lily's trust: Unchanged (She remains unaware of the discussion and her role in the events) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Unchanged at this time (Their focus was on the story earlier) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Slightly Increased (News of Sapphire's honest communication trickles down, earning some respect) Ms. Bowman nods thoughtfully, \\"We must keep a vigilant eye on Lily. I trust you can still help, Sapphire. Your youthful appearance belies your proven resourcefulness, and we need that now more than ever.\\" **Ensuing Strategy:** Encouraged by Ms. Bowman's words, Sapphire is ready to implement strategies to watch over Lily more effectively, ensuring her innate powers don't cause any further regressions. It's vital to maintain a safe environment for all the children, and Sapphire will need to continuously reinforce her role in this situation. **Immediate Objectives:** 1. Increase vigilance around Lily: Sapphire will aim to create a safe play area for Lily, where her interactions can be carefully monitored. Roll a d20 to see how effectively Sapphire can enforce this strategy. 2. Build a support network: She will attempt to enlist the older kids' help by explaining the sensitivity of the issue (without alarming them) and stressing the need for teamwork. A d20 roll will determine the success of rallying their support. Sapphire knows that managing these objectives is crucial not only for the well-being of everyone in the orphanage but also to prevent further personal regression that could undermine her capabilities. Please roll a d20 for the effective establishment of a vigilant environment for Lily. Subsequently, we will need another roll for the attempt at rallying the older children's support."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"With a roll of 1, Sapphire’s attempt to set up a controlled and safe play area for Lily goes awry. As she tries to establish boundaries and designate a specific spot for Lily to play in, her plans are met with unexpected chaos. Perhaps the younger children, still frazzled by the earlier regression incident, become restless and inadvertently disrupt the setup. Lily might sense the tension and become more agitated, leading to an inadvertent surge of her powers. **The Regression Incident:** Due to the critical failure of this attempt, another age regression event is triggered. Sapphire feels the now familiar wave of dizziness hit her as Lily’s emotions spike and her powers lash out unintentionally. As Sapphire tries to regain her balance and composure, she realizes she has regressed further in age. Since we previously established that a d12 would be appropriate for determining the extent of regression to avoid exceeding her total age, please roll a d12 to find out by how many years Sapphire regresses this time. A higher roll will mean a more significant drop in age, increasing the difficulty of her situation. **Trust Level Consequences:** - Lily's trust: Potentially Decreased (Stressful environment despite Sapphire’s intentions) - Headmistress's trust: Decreased (The strategy failed, leading to concerns over Sapphire's effectiveness) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Decreased (Another frightening regression event) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Seriously Decreased (They perceive Sapphire's efforts as unsuccessful, diminishing her standing further) Let's see the outcome of the d12 roll to assess the full impact of this critical setback."},{"prompt":"10","completion":"With a d12 roll of 10, Sapphire experiences a significant regression, becoming a mere 4 years old. As a young child now, her physical stature, emotional maturity, and cognitive abilities have greatly diminished. **Updated Situation:** - Current age: 4 - Lily's trust: Will be confused by Sapphire's regression, may see her as a peer rather than someone to look up to. - Headmistress's trust: Greatly Decreased, as Sapphire is now in need of care herself, instead of providing it. - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Mixed. Some might now see Sapphire as a playmate while others lose a figure of comfort. - Older orphanage kids' trust: Greatly Decreased, as they see her abilities greatly diminished and her authority gone. Sapphire is now experiencing firsthand the power that Lily possesses. As a 4-year-old, her ability to take care of others is severely compromised, and she would likely become reliant on the headmistress and the older children. The dynamic at the orphanage changes dramatically. Ms. Bowman is now faced with a dual problem: taking care of a regressed Sapphire and managing Lily's unpredictable powers. The headmistress may have to come up with new strategies for addressing Lily's power and potentially finding a way to restore Sapphire to her actual age. **Immediate Actions:** The headmistress would now take the lead, looking after the very young Sapphire and trying to keep Lily calm. The older children might be called upon to help manage the situation, adding a level of responsibility to them and altering the dynamics within the orphanage. Given Sapphire's regression: 1. Ms. Bowman must oversee the care of Sapphire, who would perhaps retain memories of her true age but struggle to articulate and act upon them due to her physical and mental regression. 2. The orphanage staff and older children might be instructed to observe Lily closely, prevent her from using her powers further, and ensure the safety of all children. A return to a previous state for Sapphire - if indeed possible - would require understanding Lily's powers more deeply, potentially seeking the knowledge of someone adept in magic or similar mysteries, if such individuals exist in this world. Since Sapphire is now currently unable to guide her own actions to any meaningful effect due to her age, the next phase of this roleplay scenario would focus on how the headmistress, the staff, and the older children respond to the dramatic transformations and the subsequent need to protect and potentially restore those affected by Lily's power."},{"prompt":"Since it's game over for Sapphire, we'll restart the scenario. tweaking the rules: for regression, instead of a d12, use a d4. additionally, add an objective dilemma, if I prioritize one action over another, it may have consequences or lower the trust with a particular party and improve the trust with another.","completion":"Restarting the scenario with the updated rules, Sapphire once again returns to the orphanage to support Ms. Bowman in caring for the children, particularly the enigmatic Lily with her age-regressing abilities. We will use a d4 for regression events, and add a dilemma to the mix which will require Sapphire to make choices about where to focus her attention, knowing these choices will have direct consequences on trust levels with different parties. **Trust System: Reinitialized** - Lily's trust: Neutral - Headmistress's trust: High (Sapphire is a trusted former resident now returning to help) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Neutral (They have yet to form an opinion) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Neutral (They will judge based on her actions) **Scenario Start:** As before, Sapphire's first task is to interact with Lily and the other children to build trust and manage any incidents. She will also have to juggle responsibilities such as chores, meals, and keeping the orphanage running smoothly. **Objective Dilemma:** Sapphire will have to prioritize her tasks throughout the day. For example, she might face a choice between helping the kitchen staff prepare lunch (potentially boosting trust with younger kids and staff) and organizing a game for the older kids (which could influence older kids’ trust). Let's see how Sapphire handles her first major interaction with Lily. Please roll a d20 for Sapphire’s first attempt to engage Lily in play. A high roll will signify success, while a low roll on the d20 might lead to a regression incident, wherein we would use the d4 to determine the extent of the regression."},{"prompt":"19","completion":"With a roll of 19, Sapphire's reentry into the orphanage setting is met with remarkable ease and grace. She approaches Lily with a gentle smile and extends an invitation for a game of memory cards, a simple yet engaging activity that can keep Lily's attention focused. Lily reacts with enthusiasm, briskly joining in and delighting in the challenge as Sapphire carefully watches over her. The other children take notice of Sapphire's kind approach and calm demeanor, which resonates positively throughout the room. They begin to gravitate toward the area, drawn by the fun and secure atmosphere Sapphire has created. The potential for an age regression incident is greatly reduced under her attentive supervision. **Adjusted Trust Levels:** - Lily's trust: Increased (She is enjoying the attention and the game) - Headmistress's trust: Remains High (Sapphire has handled her first interaction with great success) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Increased (They see Sapphire as a source of fun and safety) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Slightly Increased (Observing her competence in managing the situation) **Next Tasks and Dilemmas:** 1. **Meal Preparation vs. Older Kids' Game**: The kitchen staff could use help with preparing lunch, which is crucial for keeping the younger kids happy and gaining the staff's trust. Alternatively, setting up an engaging activity for the older children could bolster her standing with them, but potentially at the expense of the former. 2. **Personal Time with Lily vs. Counseling Older Kids**: Spending one-on-one time with Lily could increase personal trust and her ability to manage Lily's power. On the other hand, there's a group of older kids who are dealing with their own issues and trusting Sapphire could help them greatly. The headmistress emphasized the importance of keeping a close eye on Lily but also values the well-being of all children. Choose one dilemma to focus on first, then roll a d20 to determine the success of Sapphire's chosen task. The outcome will influence trust levels and Sapphire's ability to maintain control of the environment. Remember, prioritizing one action over another will have consequences."},{"prompt":"I choose meal preparation. I roll 2","completion":"With a roll of 2, Sapphire's decision to help with meal preparation encounters significant difficulties. Perhaps the kitchen is short-staffed that day, or the supplies are delivered late, leading to a rushed and somewhat chaotic situation. Sapphire might find herself overwhelmed, trying to assist with tasks that are a bit beyond her current capabilities, causing a mistake like an accidental spill or improperly cooked food, which affects the meal and the mood in the dining hall. **Adjusted Trust Levels:** - Lily's trust: Unchanged (Lily is likely unaware of the kitchen issues) - Headmistress's trust: Slightly Decreased (The headmistress expected better coordination during mealtime) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Decreased (The mistake during mealtime directly affects their comfort) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Slightly Increased (They notice Sapphire's attempt to help out, though they did not benefit directly) **Consequences:** As a result of the mishap in the kitchen, the younger kids become cranky and difficult to manage, and the staff is stressed by the unexpected problems. This environment is ripe for Lily to become agitated, increasing the risk of her powers manifesting. To avoid an incident with Lily, Sapphire must now roll a d4 to see if she can navigate through the rest of the mealtime without triggering Lily’s powers, as the stress could inadvertently cause her power to activate. Please roll a d4 to determine the outcome. A higher roll will indicate a larger regression, should Lily's powers flare up."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"A roll of 1 on the d4 is a relief in an otherwise challenging day for Sapphire. This means that while the atmosphere is tense and the risk of an incident was high, Lily’s powers do not manifest significantly at this time. Sapphire's attentiveness and perhaps a bit of luck prevent Lily from becoming too stressed, warding off a potential regression incident. **Stabilization Efforts:** Seeing that the meal preparation did not go as planned, Sapphire is now more determined to ensure the rest of the day proceeds without such disruptions. She takes a deep breath and refocuses on her tasks, drawing on her resourcefulness to stabilize the situation. **Adjusted Trust Levels:** - Lily's trust: Unchanged (No incident occurred to cause distress) - Headmistress's trust: Unchanged (No further decrease due to avoided incident) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Unchanged (No regression incident, but still cranky from the mealtime mishap) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Unchanged (The outcome of meal preparation doesn't directly impact them) **Next Steps:** Given the narrowly avoided regression incident during mealtime, Sapphire might want to spend some time with Lily to soothe any residual stress from the hectic meal, ensuring she remains calm. Alternatively, Sapphire can turn her attention to counseling older kids as originally planned, which might boost her standing with them and reinforce her role as a caretaker in the orphanage. Helping the older children could also indirectly protect Lily by creating a more supportive atmosphere overall. Sapphire must now choose which group to focus on next: spending time with Lily or counseling the older children. Her decision will help shape the rest of the day and influence trust levels significantly. Please indicate Sapphire's choice and roll a d20 to determine the success of her actions."},{"prompt":"Sapphire chooses to spend time with the older girls. I roll 15.","completion":"With a roll of 15, Sapphire makes significant headway in connecting with the older children. She sits down with the older girls and attentively listens to their concerns, offering guidance and support. By drawing from her own experiences growing up in the orphanage and returning as a caretaker, she forms a stronger bond with them. Sapphire's empathy and genuine effort to aid the older girls in navigating their struggles do not go unnoticed. The girls begin to see her as someone who genuinely cares and understands what they are going through, helping bridge the gap that may have existed between them. **Adjusted Trust Levels:** - Lily's trust: Unchanged (She's busy with other activities while Sapphire focuses on the older girls) - Headmistress's trust: Increased (The headmistress appreciates Sapphire's initiative and the positive impact on the older children) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Unchanged (Their view is not affected by this particular action) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Greatly Increased (Sapphire earns their respect and trust) **Positive Outcome:** This successful interaction has several outcomes. The older girls, feeling valued and heard, are more likely to cooperate with Sapphire in the future. They might also become even more understanding towards the younger kids, including Lily, and offer their help, which creates a more harmonious environment overall. Additionally, the headmistress notices that the empathetic approach used with the older kids has eased some of the day-to-day tension within the orphanage walls. She commends Sapphire for her effective communication and leadership skills, further solidifying Sapphire's role and reputation as a caretaker. Having solidified her standing with one group of orphans, Sapphire still needs to maintain a delicate balance of attention to ensure all the children's needs are met. She can now approach her tasks with a supportive network of older kids, which may help her manage Lily's power and prevent future incidents. Sapphire's next steps will need to consider the immediate needs of the orphanage and how she can leverage the newly gained trust of the older kids to maintain a safe and caring environment for everyone. It will be essential for Sapphire to continue this balancing act throughout the rest of the day, remaining vigilant of Lily's powers while fostering trust among all the children."},{"prompt":"Sapphire proposes to have Lily sleep with her in her room, so that Lily doesn't regress other kids while she sleeps, and this way Lily can be monitored at night more easily.","completion":"Sapphire's proposal to have Lily sleep in her room at night to easily monitor her and prevent any nocturnal age-regression incidents is a practical idea that could address one of the orphanage's significant concerns. This close proximity would allow Sapphire to intervene quickly if Lily were to exhibit signs of distress that could trigger her abilities. To determine how the headmistress and the others react to Sapphire's proposal, a roll is not necessary, as this is a strategic decision. Instead, let's consider the reactions of each party based on the current levels of trust and the rationale behind the decision. **Reactions to the Proposal:** - **Headmistress Ms. Bowman**: Given Sapphire's history of responsibility and the successful bonding with the older kids, the Headmistress is likely to trust Sapphire's judgment. Acknowledging that night-time incidents would pose a unique challenge without proper supervision, Ms. Bowman could see the wisdom in this proactive measure. - **Lily**: As a young child, Lily may feel reassured by the presence of an older \\"sister\\" figure during the night and this could further deepen her trust in Sapphire if handled caringly. - **Younger Orphanage Kids**: They may initially be indifferent or slightly envious of Lily’s special treatment, but as long as their own bedtime routines remain unbothered, this sentiment would be minimal. - **Older Orphanage Kids**: Understanding the troubles and stakes involved, they would appreciate Sapphire's dedication to everyone's safety. This could reinforce the trust they've placed in her as someone who cares for the well-being of the orphanage. **Implementation of the Proposal:** With the headmistress's likely approval, Sapphire would prepare her room to accommodate Lily, ensuring it is safe, comfortable, and calming for the young girl. She would explain to Lily the new sleeping arrangement in a way that frames it positively, perhaps as a special sleepover or similar concept that would resonate well with a child. Sapphire would also need to explain the situation to the other children transparently, emphasizing that this is for everyone's safety and that she remains available to all of them, not just Lily. Her ability to communicate this delicately would be an important factor in maintaining the trust she has built. This new arrangement signifies a pivotal shift in Sapphire's role but is also a testament to her commitment to the orphanage. It would require Sapphire to be attuned to any changes in Lily’s behavior during the night, ready to soothe her or intervene if her powers activate. As Sapphire continues with her plan, she'll carry on with her daytime responsibilities, now with the added aspect of her attentiveness during the night. This dual role will test her, given that Lily's abilities do not distinguish between night and day, and maintaining focus at all times will be essential."},{"prompt":"what's my next objective","completion":"With the arrangement for Lily to sleep in Sapphire's room set into motion, Sapphire's next objective is to ensure a smooth transition to this new setup and continue managing her daytime responsibilities effectively. Here are several objectives that Sapphire might focus on: 1. **Prevent Regression Incidents**: Sapphire must be vigilant during the day to keep Lily's stress levels low, preventing any accidental age-regression incidents among the children. 2. **Prepare for the Night**: Ready her room for Lily's stay, which includes making it child-proof and comforting to help ensure Lily sleeps well. 3. **Build Day-to-Night Routines**: Develop structured routines that transition seamlessly from day to night, reinforcing a sense of normalcy and stability for Lily, such as a bedtime story or lullaby. 4. **Maintain Relationships**: Continue to build on the trust established with all age groups of the orphanage, as managing Lily's powers is a task that indirectly involves everyone's cooperation. Sapphire may need to divide her time and attention strategically between these objectives to maintain her effectiveness. For instance, while prepping for the night, she should not neglect her duties towards the other children, which could potentially lower their trust. Considering the above objectives, please choose a specific task or combination of tasks that Sapphire will prioritize for her next steps. Based on your selection, we can proceed with the necessary actions or possible rolls to determine the outcomes."},{"prompt":"I try to prevent regression incidents","completion":"Preventing further regression incidents is an essential task for Sapphire that requires a balance of vigilance, understanding of the children's behavior, and swift action when the situation demands it. Her focus for this objective would involve keeping a calm and structured environment, especially around Lily, and maintaining a watchful eye for signs of distress that may trigger Lily's powers. **Key Actions for Prevention:** 1. **Monitoring Lily**: Observing Lily's interactions with the other children to intervene before her emotions escalate. 2. **Engaging Activities**: Planning engaging and relaxing activities that keep Lily and the other children occupied. This might include arts and crafts, storytelling, or outdoor play. 3. **Educating the Children**: Informing the older children about the importance of maintaining a peaceful environment without going into specifics that might scare them or make them overly curious about Lily's powers. **Roll for Preventative Measures:** To determine the success of Sapphire's preventative strategies throughout the day, let's roll a d20. A high roll signifies that her measures are effective and the day proceeds without any age-regression incidents. A lower roll might indicate that despite her efforts, there are some close calls or minor incidents that require quick thinking and intervention. Please roll a d20 to see how successful Sapphire is in preventing any regression incidents during her watchful day."},{"prompt":"18","completion":"With a roll of 18, Sapphire excels in her efforts to prevent any age-regression incidents. Her vigilant monitoring of Lily, combined with the carefully selected activities, creates an atmosphere where Lily feels content and is less likely to inadvertently use her powers. Whether she organizes a treasure hunt that captivates Lily's imagination or leads a calming group storytelling session, Sapphire's attentiveness and intuition allow her to anticipate and diffuse any situations that could have escalated. The older children, perceptive of the day's smooth flow, follow Sapphire's example and contribute to upholding the tranquil environment. **Positive Impact on Trust Levels:** - Lily's trust: Increased (Feeling happy and secure following the day's activities) - Headmistress's trust: Greatly Increased (Impressed by the lack of incidents) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Increased (They enjoyed a safe and fun day) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Increased (Respecting Sapphire's capable handling of the day) **Continued Strategy:** Emboldened by the success of her preventative measures, Sapphire can approach the evening with confidence. Preparing for the night, she ensures that her room is ready for Lily to join her, taking into account all safety precautions and comfort needs. Sapphire's next steps will likely involve reinforcing the positive routines established during the day and transitioning them into the evening, including setting up a calming bedtime ritual for Lily. She might also want to take some time to personally reassure the other children, explaining that she is still there for everyone, even with her increased responsibility towards Lily. With the evening drawing near, Sapphire knows that maintaining this sense of stability is crucial for a peaceful night. As bedtime approaches, she focuses on creating a serene atmosphere to foster a good night's sleep for Lily, all the while remaining alert to any signs that might require her immediate care. Please indicate if there's anything specific Sapphire should focus on for the evening, or if you'd like to proceed with a roll for a successful bedtime routine."},{"prompt":"Roll for bedtime. I roll 16","completion":"With a roll of 16, Sapphire executes the bedtime routine with great proficiency. She transitions into the evening by creating a soothing atmosphere in the room that she and Lily will share. Perhaps she dims the lights or lights a small bedside candle for a gentle glow, gives Lily a warm bath, or reads a beloved story. The predictable series of quiet activities, the pleasant ambience of the room, and Sapphire's comforting presence help Lily to wind down. As she cuddles with a soft toy and listens to Sapphire's calm voice reading a story, Lily begins to drift off to sleep, her eyelids heavy with drowsiness. Thanks to the success of the bedtime routine: - Lily falls asleep feeling safe and secure, reducing the chance of her powers manifesting due to stress or nightmares. - The trust between Lily and Sapphire is further cemented, as the young girl associates Sapphire with feelings of peace and security. - The headmistress and the rest of the orphanage staff are reassured by the peaceful night, boosting their confidence in Sapphire's ability to manage the situation. **Overnight Watchfulness:** With the successful bedtime transition, Sapphire now faces the important task of staying watchful overnight. As fatigue sets in, she must remain ready to soothe Lily back to sleep should she stir. Sapphire heads to bed knowing that her success this evening has made the orphanage a little safer for everyone. Tomorrow will bring new challenges, but for tonight, she has done her job exceedingly well. Resting with one eye open, she hopes for a tranquil night for all. No further rolls are needed unless you'd like to add another element to the scenario. If morning comes and all is well, Sapphire will have successfully managed Lily for an entire day and night, showcasing her dedication and adaptability in the face of extraordinary circumstances."},{"prompt":"Have an incident during the night","completion":"As Sapphire rests in the dimly lit room, her senses attuned to the smallest sound or shift in the air, the night progresses peacefully for a few hours. However, deep into the darkness, Lily begins to stir. Maybe it's a bad dream or an unfamiliar noise that has unsettled her. Lily's small fingers clench the sheets and her breathing quickens, the first signs of distress that could precipitate her mysterious power. In a heartbeat, Sapphire is awake, her body responding before her mind fully registers the situation. **Immediate Response Check:** We will roll a d20 to evaluate how effectively Sapphire responds to the incident. A high roll means she is able to quickly and efficiently soothe Lily back to peaceful sleep. A low roll could indicate that her response is not fast enough and Lily's power might activate, resulting in an inadvertent age-regression incident. Please roll a d20 to determine the effectiveness of Sapphire's immediate response to the nighttime incident. If the roll is unsuccessful and Lily’s power does manifest, we will need to follow it with a d4 roll to determine the extent of any regression that may occur."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"The roll of 1 indicates that despite Sapphire's preparedness and best intentions, she is caught off guard when Lily becomes distressed in the night. Perhaps Sapphire was in a deeper sleep than she expected, or the onset of Lily's stress was too sudden and intense. As Lily's powers activate in her agitated state, a soft glow emanates from her, spreading quickly to encompass a sleepy Sapphire. Before either of them can fully awaken or understand what's happening, the power has taken effect. **Age Regression Incident:** Please roll a d4 to determine the extent of Sapphire's unfortunate regression due to the critical failure to soothe Lily in time. This will indicate how many years Sapphire regresses in age. If the regression is significant, it may require not only a quick adjustment from Sapphire but also an emergency intervention from Ms. Bowman and the orphanage staff."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"With a roll of 4 on the d4, Sapphire experiences the maximum regression possible within the established system. Her age recedes by 4 years, transforming her from a capable 17-year-old caretaker back into a 13-year-old girl. In the dim moonlight filtering through the window, Sapphire's clothes now hang loosely on her smaller frame, and her mind races to comprehend the sudden changes. **Adjusted Trust Levels and Immediate Situation:** - Lily's trust: Unchanged (She is unaware and distressed, not understanding the impact of her powers) - Headmistress's trust: Decreased (The night watch has failed, resulting in a significant problem) - Younger orphanage kids' trust: Potentially Decreased (This could affect their morning if the incident is discovered) - Older orphanage kids' trust: Potentially Decreased (Sapphire's authority and capability are now in question) Sapphire, now significantly younger, will struggle with the sudden shift in her physical abilities and mental state. While she retains the memories and knowledge of her former self, acting on them will be challenging due to her new limitations. **Emergent Actions:** The immediate objective is to calm Lily and prevent further use of her powers, especially since Sapphire’s ability to manage on her own is now compromised. She needs to soothe Lily and then likely seek help from Ms. Bowman or another trusted adult: 1. **Calm Lily**: A d20 roll is required here to see if Sapphire, despite her own regression, can still manage to soothe Lily and prevent more incidents. 2. **Seek Help**: Depending on the outcome, a quick decision might be needed to get assistance from the headmistress, which could involve alerting her to the situation without causing panic. Please roll a d20 to determine if Sapphire, even as a 13-year-old, can still effectively soothe Lily. If the roll is successful, it could help mitigate some of the damage to the trust levels by proving that Sapphire maintains her caring abilities despite her younger age."},{"prompt":"Remember that when Lily regresses others, she in turn grows up.","completion":"That's correct; as part of our scenario rules, when Lily causes others to regress, she absorbs their age and grows older in return. So, with Sapphire's regression by 4 years, Lily correspondingly would have aged by 4 years. Therefore, Lily, who was originally supposed to be a 3-year-old (but already mysteriously aged up to closer to 3 due to previous undisclosed incidents before our scenario began), would now be approximately 7 years old. **Current Situation:** - Lily is now around 7 years old, both physically and cognitively more mature than before the incident. - Sapphire has been regressed to a 13-year-old and must navigate the challenges of this younger state. - The overnight incident might reveal Lily's power to her if she becomes cognizant of the change, which could have far-reaching implications for her behavior and control over her powers. Lily's growth and newfound awareness of her condition could significantly alter the dynamics at the orphanage. She might be confused or frightened by her sudden jump in age and the associated changes. If she becomes aware of her powers, it may lead to new challenges for Sapphire and the headmistress. Before we address these complexities, let us see if the now-younger Sapphire can still manage to soothe Lily. **Roll for Soothing Lily:** Please roll a d20 to determine if the newly-regressed Sapphire can effectively calm Lily down after the incident. A high roll indicates that Sapphire is still able to connect with and soothe Lily despite the age regression. A low roll might signal that Lily remains distressed, potentially resulting in further complications."},{"prompt":"5","completion":"With a roll of 5, Sapphire struggles to calm Lily down in her regressed state. Being suddenly 13 years old, Sapphire's voice, demeanor, and authority have changed, and she finds it difficult to assert herself as she could have done before. Lily, now approximately 7 years old and confused by her own rapid maturation, is not easily soothed by the younger Sapphire. Lily continues to be upset, perhaps partially aware of and frightened by the rapid changes happening to herself and to Sapphire, contributing to an ongoing state of distress. With the situation escalating and Lily's powers still a threat, Sapphire realizes she needs to alert Ms. Bowman immediately for assistance. **Response from the Orphanage:** The headmistress, alerted to the issue, would rush to their aid to help stabilize Lily and address Sapphire's regression. The critical goal now is to ensure that no more children are affected and to understand the extent of the changes Lily has undergone. - **Headmistress's Trust**: Further Decreased (The incident was not contained, but she understands the difficulty of the situation) - **Lily's Trust**: Potentially increased toward the headmistress, who calms her down but possibly decreased towards Sapphire, who couldn’t, despite the fact Lily doesn't understand the mechanics behind her power - **Younger Orphanage Kids' Trust**: Potentially Decreased if they woke up during the incident; otherwise unchanged - **Older Orphanage Kids' Trust**: Decreased due to the apparent breakdown in order and safety under Sapphire's watch **Next Steps:** In the wake of the incident, Ms. Bowman will play a more active role in managing Lily's powers and seek a solution for the children who've been regressed. For Sapphire, this means adjusting to her younger self's role and capabilities, while possibly attempting to regain trust and demonstrate that she can still contribute positively to the orphanage, albeit in a different capacity. The challenge now is twofold: finding a way to either reverse or manage the age regressive effects adequately and guiding Lily—now more cognizant of her abilities—towards a place where she understands and controls her power so that she doesn’t harm herself or others. As the scenario has drastically shifted, Sapphire’s immediate actions and Ms. Bowman's next steps will be pivotal in determining the orphanage's future stability."},{"prompt":"Напиши на C++ игру-кликер про развитие цивилизации.

Ниже приводятся основные шаги для создания мода с новой фракцией: 1. **Основы моддинга**: - Изучите \`modding manual\`, который обычно находится в каталоге игры, чтобы понять, какие возможности есть для моддирования и какие команды вам понадобятся. - Запишите свой модмейкинговый план: решите концепцию нации, её основные особенности и уникальные атрибуты. - Создайте папку для вашего мода в директории \`mods\` игры. 2. **Изучение синтаксиса скриптов**: - Откройте файл с расширением \`.dm\` в текстовом редакторе, например Notepad++ или аналоге. - Изучите синтаксис команд и параметров, которые нужны для создания новых юнитов, командиров, провинций и так далее. 3. **Создание нации**: - В вашем .dm файле начните с определения новой нации с помощью команды \`newnation\`. - Добавьте описание вашей нации через команду \`#descr\`. - Придумайте и пропишите уникальные юниты, маги, священников и т.д. с помощью секций \`newmonster\`, \`newcommander\`, \`newhero\`. 4. **Создание юнитов**: - Каждому юниту необходимо назначить основные характеристики (\`#hp\`, \`#morale\`, \`#str\` и т.д.). - Задайте специальные способности через команды типа \`#magic\`, \`#special\`. 5. **Изображения и графика**: - Создайте или найдите подходящие спрайты и изображения для своей нации. Следите за соответствием размеров и формата изображений. - Залинкуйте изображения к существам через команды типа \`#image\`. 6. **Тестирование и отладка**: - Тестируйте ваш мод на предмет ошибок, запуская игру с вашим модом и проверяя, правильно ли все работает. - Внесите необходимые корректировки, опираясь на механику игры и обратную связь (если мод тестируется сообществом). 7. **Документация**: - Создайте файл \`readme\` для вашего мода, в котором подробно опишите все изменения, добавления и особенности вашей нации. 8. **Публикация**: - Опубликуйте ваш мод в сообществе, например на форумах или в Steam Workshop, чтобы другие игроки могли его скачать и опробовать. Помните, что создание мода требует понимания игры и её механики, творческого подхода, а также навыков работы с графикой и текстом. Также важно соблюдать баланс, чтобы ваша фракция не была слишком сильной или слабой по сравнению с существующими нациями.

LSU is well-known for its athletic programs, particularly football, as well as its contributions to research and education."},{"prompt":"Is the Rose Bowl the last college football game of the year?","completion":"The Rose Bowl is not necessarily the last college football game of the year. The Rose Bowl is one of the major college bowl games traditionally played on New Year's Day. While it is one of the most prestigious and oldest bowl games, it usually does not mark the end of the college football season. The last game of the college football season is typically the College Football Playoff National Championship game, which features the winners of the two College Football Playoff semifinal games. The College Football Playoff determines the national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The semifinal games are rotated among the major bowl games, which occasionally includes the Rose Bowl. However, the title game itself is a separate event held at a predetermined site, usually a week or so after the New Year's Day bowl games. The timing and location of the National Championship are set as part of the College Football Playoff system, which was established to determine a true national champion in the sport's highest level in the United States."},{"prompt":"What does NCAA stand for?","completion":"NCAA stands for the National Collegiate Athletic Association. It is the organization that regulates and oversees college athletics across the United States, establishing rules for eligibility, recruiting, and competition for its member colleges and universities. The NCAA is responsible for governing multiple sports and divisions, with Division I, Division II, and Division III representing different levels of competition and athletic scholarship availability."},{"prompt":"What does SEC stand for?","completion":"SEC, in the context of college sports, stands for the Southeastern Conference. It is an American college athletic conference whose member institutions are located primarily in the southeastern part of the United States. The SEC is considered one of the most powerful and competitive conferences in the NCAA Division I, particularly known for its success in football. The conference is also prominent in other sports such as basketball, baseball, and track and field."},{"prompt":"When is the Japanese academic year?","completion":"The Japanese academic year typically starts in April and ends in March of the following year. It is divided into three terms: 1. The first term, or \\"shingakki,\\" begins in April and runs until around July. 2. The second term, also known as \\"natsuyasumi,\\" is a summer break which usually lasts for a few weeks from late July to late August or early September. 3. The third term, or \\"shuugakki,\\" starts after the summer break and continues until December. 4. There is a winter break, called \\"fuyuyasumi,\\" which lasts for a few weeks from the end of December into early January. 5. After the winter break, the final term, \\"harugakki,\\" resumes in January and ends in March, followed by a spring break before the new academic year starts again in April. Some Japanese universities and schools have begun offering a more Western-style academic calendar, starting in September and ending in June, but this is less common. The traditional April start is meant to align with Japan's fiscal year and the season of cherry blossoms, symbolizing new beginnings and fresh starts for students entering new stages of their education."},{"prompt":"Why is January 1st the start of the year in Western cultures?","completion":"January 1st became the official start of the year in Western cultures primarily due to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, which was a reform of the Julian calendar initiated by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. The adoption of January 1st was a return to the earlier Roman calendar, which also recognized this date as the new year. Here are some key historical points regarding January 1st as the start of the year: 1. Early Roman Calendar: The original Roman calendar, which is believed to have been created by Romulus, the mythical founder of Rome, initially had 10 months with March as the first month of the year. This is why many of our month names are derived from their position in the old Roman calendar (e.g., September from \\"septem\\" for seven, October from \\"octo\\" for eight, etc.). 2. Julian Calendar: Julius Caesar introduced the Julian calendar in 45 BCE, which closely resembles the modern solar calendar. This calendar declared January 1st as the beginning of the year to honor Janus, the Roman god of gates and doors, and of beginnings and endings. January is named after Janus, who is typically depicted with two faces—one looking back into the past, and the other looking forward into the future. 3. Middle Ages Variability: Over time, and especially during the Middle Ages, the start of the new year varied among different cultures and was often based on significant religious dates, such as December 25th (the birth of Jesus) or March 25th (the Feast of the Annunciation). Different localities within Europe would mark the new year on various dates. 4. Gregorian Calendar Reform: To correct the drift of the calendar with respect to the equinoxes, Pope Gregory XIII implemented a reform in 1582. As part of this reform, the start of the new year was standardized to January 1st. The Gregorian calendar was gradually adopted by various countries over the ensuing centuries and became the de facto standard for most of the world. 5. Adoption Across Cultures: While initially, the Gregorian calendar was adopted primarily by Catholic countries, Protestant and Orthodox Christian countries eventually followed suit. The British Empire (including its American colonies) adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, by which time January 1st was already well established as the start of the new year in many places. Today, January 1st is universally recognized as the start of the new year in Western cultures and in many other parts of the world due to globalization and international consensus."},{"prompt":"Сделай для dominions 5 мод, добавляющий новую фракцию.","completion":"Создание мода для игры Dominions 5 может быть довольно сложной задачей, особенно с учетом того, что он включает в себя создание новой фракции со всеми связанными с ней элементами, такими как юниты, командиры, заклинания и предметы.

Take a deep breath and think step by step.","completion":"In New York State, harassment can be charged under different levels based on the severity of the behavior. The legal framework includes both criminal and non-criminal classifications for harassment. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how harassment charges can be categorized: 1. **Harassment in the Second Degree**: This is outlined in Section 240.26 of the New York Penal Law. Harassment in the second degree is considered a violation, not a crime. A violation is less serious than a misdemeanor or a felony and typically involves penalties such as fines or a maximum of 15 days in jail. 2. **Harassment in the First Degree**: Described in Section 240.25 of the New York Penal Law, harassment in the first degree is a class B misdemeanor. This is a criminal charge and a conviction can lead to a criminal record. Penalties can include up to 3 months in jail and/or fines. 3. **Aggravated Harassment**: There are also higher degrees of harassment charges, such as aggravated harassment in the second degree (Section 240.30) and aggravated harassment in the first degree (Section 240.31), which are class A misdemeanors and class E felonies, respectively. These charges are more serious and can arise, for instance, when harassment is directed towards individuals based on race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation, or involves threats of violence. Therefore, the answer to your question is yes: harassment can be classified as less than a misdemeanor in New York State when it falls into the category of Harassment in the Second Degree, which is a violation and not considered a crime under New York Penal Law. However, it's important to note that even if someone is charged with a violation, it can still have serious legal and personal consequences. If faced with such a situation, it's advisable to seek legal counsel."},{"prompt":"радиус круга равен 6 м, а площадь сектора равна 3,6 пи м^2 Найди градусную меру центрального угла сектора, используя формулу нахождения площади сектора S = (пиR^2n)/360 где n - центральный угол.","completion":"Для нахождения градусной меры центрального угла сектора (обозначим его как n) используем информацию о радиусе (R) и площади сектора (S).

} }","completion":"Upon examining this Solidity smart contract, the following details and potential issues were taken into account: 1. **Inheritance and Interfaces**: - The contract \`GenericRegistry\` is declared as \`abstract\` and extends the \`ERC721\` token functionality from the \`solmate\` library. - It implements functions from the \`IErrorsRegistries\` interface but doesn't define them in the code provided. All errors like \`OwnerOnly\`, \`ZeroAddress\`, \`ZeroValue\`, and \`Overflow\` used in \`revert\` statements should be part of the \`IErrorsRegistries\` interface. 2. **Modifiers**: - Logic that is repeated (like checking for the ownership, checking for zero address, etc.) could be refactored into modifiers for improved readability and gas optimization. 3. **Commenting**: - The comments in the contract are quite informative and adhere to the NatSpec format. However, proper documentation using NatSpec is only partially present. It's important to have all public and external functions documented so that other developers and users can understand the intended use and behavior of each function. 4. **Access Control**: - Access control is maintained using simple address checks (e.g., \`if (msg.sender != owner)\`) to restrict certain functions to the owner. It might be beneficial to use more sophisticated access control mechanisms like OpenZeppelin's \`Ownable\` or \`AccessControl\` for more nuanced access management and to reduce the risk of mistakes. 5. **State Variables**: - State variables like \`owner\`, \`manager\`, \`baseURI\`, \`totalSupply\`, and \`_locked\` are set to public, which generates getter functions automatically. 6. **Locked State Variable**: - The \`_locked\` variable is defined but never used, which suggests dead code or incomplete reentrancy protection logic. It should be investigated and either completed or removed. 7. **Functionality**: - The \`changeOwner\`, \`changeManager\`, \`setBaseURI\`, and \`tokenByIndex\` functions enforce authorization checks, preventing unauthorized access. - The \`exists\` function correctly checks for the existence of a unit by ID. 8. **Implementation Specifics**: - The \`CID_PREFIX\` is hardcoded with no mechanism to change it, which may not fit actual IPFS CID prefixes if there would be an update or alternate version. - The \`_getUnitHash\` function is marked as internal and virtual, indicating that any concrete implementation of \`GenericRegistry\` should implement this function. - The \`tokenURI\` function references \`baseURI\`, \`CID_PREFIX\`, and two calls to an internal function \`_toHex16\` but assumes CID compliance which may not be relevant for different use-cases outside IPFS compatibility. 9. **Potential Gas Optimizations**: - Functions that can be declared external instead of public may save some gas as external functions have more optimized calldata access. 10. **Missing Functionality**: - The contract lacks \`_mint\`, \`_burn\`, and other related methods to manage the tokens, which are essential aspects of an ERC721 contract. This is expected since it's declared as \`abstract\` and these methods would typically be implemented in a derived contract. 11. **Solidity Compiler Version**: - The contract is compiled with a specific version (\`^0.8.15\`), this is good practice for preventing issues with future breaking changes in the compiler. 12. **Syntax**: - The contract contains no syntax errors. 13. **Version License (MIT)**: - The contract has an SPDX license identifier comment (\`MIT\`). It's in accordance with best practices to indicate the open-source license. General Notes: - When implementing or inheriting from this contract, it is important that comprehensive testing is done, especially to make sure that there is no unforeseen behavior due to function overrides. - Some aspects such as event emissions, error management, and access control can be improved for better contract robustness and security. - It's also crucial to ensure that all the functional details meet the specific requirements of the use case it's developed for. To guarantee a contract is absolutely error-free and secure, a full security audit by a professional auditor or team is recommended, especially for a deployment on mainnet where it may handle real value."},{"prompt":"larify what specific issue you're looking to address or what aspect of the contract you'd like to focus on?

This pattern does not make use of more feature-rich access control systems like OpenZeppelin's \`Ownable\` or \`AccessControl\`, which offer better security and flexibility and are considered industry standards. - The contract lacks the concept of roles beyond a single \`owner\` and \`manager\`, which may not be sufficient for more complex permission schemes. # State Variable \`_locked\` - The \`_locked\` variable is initialized but never utilized, which indicates that reentrancy protection may be missing or incomplete. It is a potential vulnerability if the contract's functions can be re-entered before their execution is finished, especially when they include state changes and token transfers. # Function Visibility and Gas Optimization - Some functions can be declared as \`external\` instead of \`public\` to save on gas costs. The \`changeOwner\`, \`changeManager\`, and \`setBaseURI\` are examples of functions that could benefit from being declared as \`external\` since they're not intended to be called internally. # Inheritance and Implementation Details - The contract inherits from the \`ERC721\` token contract. However, it does not implement key functionalities such as minting (\`_mint\`) and burning (\`_burn\`) of tokens. These functions are essential for the management of an ERC721 token and should be implemented in derived contracts. # Lack of \`modifier\` Use - Code modularity can be improved by converting repeated access control checks into \`modifiers\`. This will enhance code reuse and make it easier to read and maintain. # Event Emissions - While the contract does emit events for ownership and management changes, and upon setting a new base URI, it should also emit events for token transfers and approvals as defined in the ERC721 standard for better tracking and transparency. # Hardcoded CID Prefix - The CID prefix for IPFS hashes is hardcoded. If there's a possibility that these might need to adapt to different formats, it is beneficial to have a way to update this prefix. # \`tokenURI\` Function - The implementation of \`tokenURI\` assumes a specific format of the data (IPFS CID). While this might be suitable for the intended use case, it lacks flexibility for other content addressing or storage mechanisms. # Interface and Abstract Contract Usage - Since the contract is abstract, the implemented interface (\`IErrorsRegistries\`) is not shown, which means it is imperative that the implementing contract correctly defines all necessary error conditions. # Solidity Version Pinning - The contract is pinned to compiler version \`^0.8.15\`, which is good for stability, but it's important to stay updated with the latest compiler versions for potential optimizations and security fixes. # Testing and Security Auditing - Given the potential financial implications, it is recommended to have this contract undergo thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and perhaps a formal verification if applicable. Security audits by professionals are also suggested before deploying to a live environment. Each aspect noted above could be scrutinized depending on where your concerns are most pronounced. For a more detailed audit or deeper analysis, a specific context or use case would be helpful. If there are particular features or mechanisms you envision utilizing or are concerned about, focusing on those areas can be more valuable for your purposes."},{"prompt":"describe how you envision the access control working in your ideal scenario? Would you like to implement role-based access control, and if so, what roles do you think are necessary?","completion":"In an ideal scenario, access control should clearly define different capabilities and permissions within the contract based on their roles, facilitating a secure and manageable way of handling privileges. Role-based access control (RBAC) is an efficient way to implement this. An RBAC system typically works by assigning roles to users, which correspond to various permissions within the system. Here's a potential access control setup for a registry-like contract which might work with an ERC721 token: # Roles 1. **Owner (Super Admin):** - Can assign and revoke roles to other addresses. - Has the ability to update critical system parameters such as base URI. - Can pause and unpause certain functions in the contract if a pause mechanism is implemented for emergency situations. 2. **Admin:** - Can manage entity-level permissions that don't affect the entire system. - Typically has capabilities such as updating configuration details provided by the Owner. 3. **Minter:** - Authorized to mint new tokens. - Could potentially have limits on how many tokens they can mint to prevent abuse of this power. 4. **Burner:** - Permitted to burn tokens, potentially with restrictions on which tokens they can burn (e.g., tokens they own or have been given explicit permission to burn). 5. **Transfer Agent:** - Can transfer tokens on behalf of the system, for example, for airdrops or system-level transfers not initiated by the token holder. 6. **Censor:** - Ability to blacklist or whitelist addresses based on compliance or other criteria. 7. **Auditor:** - Read-only access to system state for compliance and monitoring purposes. # Implementing RBAC To implement RBAC, the Solidity contract should use a well-tested library such as OpenZeppelin's \`AccessControl\`. Here's how it might work with \`AccessControl\`: \`\`\`solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.0; import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol\\"; contract MyContract is AccessControl { bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256(\\"MINTER_ROLE\\"); bytes32 public constant BURNER_ROLE = keccak256(\\"BURNER_ROLE\\"); constructor() { // Grant the contract deployer the default admin role: it will be able // to grant and revoke any roles _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender); } function mint(address to) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) { // minting logic here } function burn(uint256 tokenId) public onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) { // burning logic here } // ...rest of your contract } \`\`\` In this example: - The constructor sets the initial admin to the deployer using \`_setupRole\`. - Only addresses with the \`MINTER_ROLE\` can call the \`mint\` function. - Only addresses with the \`BURNER_ROLE\` can call the \`burn\` function. - Additional roles and permissions can be added following a similar pattern. One should be cognizant of over-complicating the access control system. It's crucial to maintain balance such that roles allow for necessary administrative tasks without creating too much complexity or presenting new vectors for security vulnerabilities. Finally, it's also important to have a way to transfer or renounce the initial admin role set in the constructor to ensure the decentralization and security of the contract’s administration in the long term."},{"prompt":"begin with the simple access control and then iterate to include the roles you've mentioned. Let's start with the Owner and Manager roles. How do these roles interact with the system, and what are their capabilities?","completion":"Starting with simple access control and iterating towards a more complex role-based system is a sound approach. Initially, the Owner and Manager roles can be defined with specific capabilities tailored to their responsibilities within the system. Here is an example of how these roles can be structured and implemented using Solidity: # Owner Role The Owner is typically the account that deploys the contract and has the highest level of control. The capabilities of the Owner can include: 1. **Ownership Transfer**: The ability to transfer ownership of the contract to another account. This means they can relinquish their Owner role or assign it to another entity. 2. **Role Management**: Assigning or revoking the Manager role to other accounts. 3. **Critical Function Management**: Updating critical system configuration and state variables (e.g., base URI, smart contract upgrades if applicable). 4. **Emergency Controls**: Pausing and unpausing the contract or certain functions in case of emergencies (often used in systems implementing a circuit breaker pattern). 5. **Destructive Actions**: In specific cases, the owner might also have the ability to destroy the contract (selfdestruct), though this is considered dangerous and should be used with caution. # Manager Role The Manager is a less privileged role that aids the Owner in day-to-day administrative tasks. Their capabilities might be limited to: 1. **Operational Management**: Performing certain administrative tasks required for the upkeep and maintenance of the contract. 2. **Mint/Burn Operations**: Depending on the system, a Manager might be allowed to mint or burn tokens, especially in applications where asset management is a key component. # Simple Implementation Using OnlyOwner and OnlyManager Modifiers In the initial phase, you can define these roles and their permissions using custom modifiers like \`onlyOwner\` and \`onlyManager\`. Here is a conceptual example: \`\`\`solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract MyContract { address public owner; address public manager; // Event for logging ownership transfer event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner); // Event for logging manager change event ManagerChanged(address indexed previousManager, address indexed newManager); modifier onlyOwner() { require(msg.sender == owner, \\"Caller is not the owner\\"); _; } modifier onlyManager() { require(msg.sender == manager, \\"Caller is not the manager\\"); _; } constructor() { owner = msg.sender; emit OwnershipTransferred(address(0), msg.sender); } function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner { require(newOwner != address(0), \\"New owner is the zero address\\"); emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, newOwner); owner = newOwner; } function changeManager(address newManager) public onlyOwner { emit ManagerChanged(manager, newManager); manager = newManager; } // Implementation of functions that the Owner and Manager roles can perform // ... } \`\`\` # Notes on the Simple Implementation - The Owner role is represented by the \`owner\` state variable, and the ability to call owner-only functions is enforced by the \`onlyOwner\` modifier. - Ownership transfer is a crucial operation; thus, it is accompanied by an event (\`OwnershipTransferred\`) that logs the action for transparency. - The Manager role can be implemented as a single account with the \`manager\` state variable and accessed using the \`onlyManager\` modifier. - To start simple and avoid complexity, the Manager might not have any role-management permissions and should have a limited set of actions they can perform. # Advancing to Role-Based Access Control After starting with this simplified model, you can migrate to a more robust and flexible access control system, such as the \`AccessControl\` provided by OpenZeppelin, which gives you the option to define roles more granularly and manage permissions with greater flexibility. When migrating, ensure to handle the transition smoothly by setting up roles based on the existing Owner and Manager accounts and then expanding the system to include new roles as the system's requirements grow."},{"prompt":"we'll iterate on this diagram to include the RBAC system with the roles you've described. Before we do that, do you have any additional details or changes you'd like to make to this initial diagram?","completion":"The initial access control with Owner and Manager roles outlined earlier forms a straightforward two-tier hierarchy. For clarity, let's summarize that model in a diagrammatic form: \`\`\` +----------------+ +----------------+ | | | | | Owner | | Manager | | (Superuser) | | (Limited Admin)| | | | | +-------+--------+ +-------+--------+ | | | | | +----------v--------------+ | | | +------->+ Contract Functions | | (Mint, Burn, Transfer, | | Update Settings, etc.) | +-------------------------+ \`\`\` Any specific changes or additional details to this simple initial diagram would depend on the feedback from stakeholders, potential security assessments, or operational requirements that might emerge. Some considerations might include: 1. **Explicit Functions**: Define explicitly what functions the Manager can perform, which might include minting/burning tokens, changing non-critical parameters, or performing system maintenance operations. 2. **Restricted Access**: Highlight that the Manager should not have the capability to transfer ownership or assign roles, making these functions exclusive to the Owner. 3. **Emergency Functions**: If there are any emergency functions (such as pausing the contract), clearly indicate whether they are accessible to the Manager or solely to the Owner. 4. **Auditability**: If auditing is a concern, you might want to incorporate mechanisms or processes that log or track role usage. 5. **Transfers**: For clarity, specify whether the Manager has permission to transfer tokens and under what conditions, if it's pertinent to the use case. 6. **Ownership Transfer Mechanics**: For the Owner role, delineate the process for ownership transfer, ensuring safe and intentional transferability with checks against transferring to non-desirable addresses (like the zero address). 7. **Contract Destruction**: If the Owner has the power to destruct the contract (using \`selfdestruct\`), this should be approached cautiously. Consider alternatives like a contract upgrade or migration mechanism. Once you're ready to expand to the RBAC system, the diagram could be updated to reflect multiple roles with different levels of permissions. This could be represented in a more complex, layered format where roles are interconnected and some roles hold the power to assign or revoke lower-level roles. An updated diagram would include the new roles like Minter, Burner, Auditor, and any others that you decide to implement, detailing their specific permissions and interactions with the contract's functions."},{"prompt":"Before we proceed to the RBAC system, do you have any other modifications or additions for this diagram?","completion":"The initial diagram provided is a good starting point for a simple access control system featuring just two roles: Owner and Manager. Here are a few fine-tuning details and considerations that may be added: 1. **Change of Roles**: - Indicate that the Owner can also create or remove Manager roles, reinforcing the hierarchical structure of the system. 2. **Role Transitions**: - The possibility of role changes over time should be mentioned. For instance, an Owner might transfer their role to another party, or Managers might be replaced. 3. **Update Triggers**: - Mark events that are emitted on significant actions like ownership transfer (\`OwnershipTransferred\`) and manager change (\`ManagerChanged\`). These are critical for ensuring transparency in the contract. 4. **Function Restrictions**: - Clearly differentiate between functions that are Owner-exclusive and those that a Manager can perform. Use color coding or separate sections to demonstrate this. 5. **Security Precautions**: - Mention any security checks related to crucial functions like ensuring the new Owner is not the zero address, which prevents accidental renouncement of control. 6. **Permission Levels**: - Reflect any multi-level permissions within a role, if applicable. For example, if the Manager role can be assigned different levels of access depending on the task. With these considerations, the updated diagram keeps the simplicity but provides further details on role responsibilities and interactions. Any additional modifications would depend on the specific requirements of the contract and the feedback of the stakeholders. If there are no further additions or changes, this basic diagram serves as a solid foundation that can be built upon with more complex RBAC features as the system evolves."},{"prompt":"Now, let's move on to the RBAC system. We'll add the new roles such as Minter, Burner, Auditor, and others, detailing their specific permissions and interactions with the contract’s functions. Are there any specific details or interactions for these new roles that you would like to highlight in the diagram?","completion":"Moving towards an RBAC system involves adding roles with specific permissions and interactions with the contract's functions. Below is an outline of roles such as Minter, Burner, Auditor, and others, along with the key details that should be highlighted in the RBAC diagram: # Owner (Super Admin) - Has ultimate control, including assigning roles like Minter and Burner. - Can transfer ownership and manage critical system settings. - May have emergency powers such as pausing the contract. # Admin - Assigned by the Owner, with the ability to carry out specific administrative duties. - May have the power to update certain non-critical settings. # Minter Role - Granted the permission to create new tokens. - The capability to mint might come with rate limits or caps to prevent abuse. # Burner Role - Allowed to destroy tokens, usually their own or by approval from other token holders. - There might be restrictions or rules governing when and how tokens can be burned. # Auditor Role - Read-only access to inspect transaction histories and system states. - Cannot change any state but can generate reports for compliance monitoring. # Transfer Agent Role - Can perform token transfers, possibly including airdrops or recoveries. - Access might be restricted to predefined rules and oversight. # Specific Permissions and Interactions - Certain roles may hold overlapping permissions, such as a Manager being able to mint or burn tokens. - Hierarchical access control where some roles like Admin can bestow more granular permissions like creating a Minter but not a new Admin. # Diagram Considerations - **Multiple Layers**: Show that the Owner is at the top of the hierarchy with Admins, Minters, Burners, and Auditors beneath. - **Role Interactions**: Illustrate which roles can assign or revoke permissions from other roles. - **Function Access**: Visualize which contract functions are accessible to each role. - **Event Log**: Highlight events that are logged for transparency and auditability, such as \`RoleGranted\` and \`RoleRevoked\`. - **Permission Scope**: Indicate the scope of each role clearly, whether they have global permissions or more scoped, function-specific access. Remember that the end goal of the diagram is to present a clear visualization of what each role can do in the system. It should be understandable even to those who may not be deeply familiar with Solidity or smart contract development. Once all the roles and their permissions are carefully plotted, the RBAC system can be implemented in the contract using something like OpenZeppelin's \`AccessControl\` for comprehensive role management. This updated diagram would serve as a blueprint for the implementation and inform users and auditors about the contract's access control architecture."},{"prompt":"do you have any further modifications or should we move on to the next step?

} }","completion":"Given the contract provided, let's move on to the incorporation of a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with specific roles such as Minter, Burner, Auditor, and others. To do this, we should first identify what additional functionality needs to be added or modified in the current contract to support these roles effectively: 1. **Role Definitions**: Introduce new constants for role identifiers using \`bytes32\` type variables. These identifiers will be utilized by the \`AccessControl\` library to manage permissions. 2. **Initializer Function**: If the contract is to be upgradeable, use an initializer instead of a constructor to set up initial roles and permissions. 3. **Permission Assignment**: Define a system to assign and revoke roles to different addresses, allowing for flexible permission management. 4. **Role-Specific Functions**: Implement role checks within functions related to token minting, burning, transferring, and setting contract parameters to ensure that only addresses with the appropriate roles can call these functions. 5. **Event Logging**: Log role assignments and other critical state changes with events for transparency and traceability.

However, since this contract inherits from \`ERC721\`, which does not typically involve functions that make external calls to unknown addresses, the risk of reentrancy in this specific contract might not be significant. **Validity**: Partially valid. It's accurate that \`_locked\` is unused, but reentrancy attacks normally exploit functions that make external calls and handle Eth transfers or changes to critical state variables. If such functionality were to be added, the issue's validity would increase. **Vulnerable Line(s)**: \`\`\`solidity // Reentrancy lock uint256 internal _locked = 1; \`\`\` # Issue 2: Simple Address Check for Owner Privileges **Claim**: The contract employs simple address checks for owner privileges and lacks more robust controls like multi-sig or timelock. **Review**: The contract does use simple address checks (\`if (msg.sender != owner)\`) for owner-restricted operations, which poses risks if the private key is compromised. **Validity**: Valid. While the owner mechanism is a common pattern, the concern about the potential risk if the owner key is compromised is accurate. However, whether multisig or timelocks are necessary should be determined by the threat model of the contract. **Vulnerable Line(s)**: \`\`\`solidity function changeOwner(address newOwner) external virtual { // Check for the ownership if (msg.sender != owner) { revert OwnerOnly(msg.sender, owner); } // ... } \`\`\` # Issue 3: Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System **Claim**: Not implementing RBAC limits flexibility and security of permission management. **Review**: The contract currently exhibits a flat permission model with only 'owner' and 'manager' roles. This structure is indeed limited compared to a full RBAC system. **Validity**: Valid. The contract does not use RBAC, which means it cannot easily support more granular permission schemes. However, whether RBAC is necessary depends on the contract's complexity and use case. **Vulnerable Line(s)**: RBAC would affect the contract's architecture rather than a specific line of code. # Issue 4: Hardcoded CID Prefix **Claim**: A hardcoded CID prefix reduces flexibility for potentially needed updates to the format in the future. **Review**: The CID prefix is indeed hardcoded, which could limit future adaptability. **Validity**: Valid. The constant CID prefix cannot be updated without deploying a new contract. If the contract intends to be compatible with changes in IPFS standards or wishes to support different hash functions in the future, this could be considered a rigidity issue. **Vulnerable Line(s)**: \`\`\`solidity string public constant CID_PREFIX = \\"f01701220\\"; \`\`\` In summary, issues 2, 3, and 4 are valid and accurately represent concerns regarding the security practices and flexibility of the current implementation.

However, the absence of its use does not pose a reentrancy vulnerability by itself, especially considering that the contract in question does not contain any functions that are typically vulnerable to reentrancy (i.e., there are no external calls or Ether transfers based on the provided code). **Conclusion**: The issue of not using \`_locked\` is valid in the sense that the variable is unnecessary and having unused code is not best practice. However, the concern about reentrancy attacks is not applicable given the context of provided functions in the contract. Thus, the claim of reentrancy vulnerability is invalid based on current functions. # Issue 2: Simple Address Check for Owner Privileges **Review**: Owner-restricted operations are indeed guarded by a simple address check and an \`OwnerOnly\` custom error is thrown if the check fails. \`\`\`solidity if (msg.sender != owner) { revert OwnerOnly(msg.sender, owner); } \`\`\` **Conclusion**: This issue is valid in terms of the check being used. However, whether this represents a security risk depends on further context. For simple contracts or when additional security mechanisms such as multi-signature are not necessary, such a check could suffice. The ownership check itself is correctly implemented and the use of the custom error provides clear feedback. # Issue 3: Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) **Review**: The contract uses a basic access control mechanism that does not implement RBAC. It involves only an \`owner\` and a \`manager\`. **Conclusion**: The claim is valid but whether it poses a problem is context-dependent. Not all contracts require RBAC, and for some applications, simple access control is appropriate. The need for RBAC generally arises in complex systems that require fine-grained permissions. # Issue 4: Hardcoded CID Prefix **Review**: The contract contains a hardcoded CID prefix, which indicates that it expects IPFS hashes to have a specific format. The use of a hardcoded constant is a design choice that trades off flexibility for simplicity and gas optimization. \`\`\`solidity string public constant CID_PREFIX = \\"f01701220\\"; \`\`\` **Conclusion**: The issue is valid from a design flexibility standpoint. Technically, it's not a security vulnerability but rather a potential inflexibility in the design. If future standards change, the hardcoded format may be incompatible. However, some contracts may intend to be immutable and as such are designed with hardcoded values. It also depends on if future-proofing for different hash formats is integral to the contract’s intended purpose. In summary, issues 1 and 4 are not vulnerabilities but rather design decisions with specific trade-offs. Issue 2 is valid, with the security implications being context-dependent—no inherent vulnerability is present with the function provided, though stronger access control measures do increase security. Issue 3 is also valid, depending on the level of complexity and granularity required for the smart contract's access control model."},{"prompt":"so base on that explain more details about . Issue 2 and issue 3 with vulnerable line with code and prove are valid with evidence","completion":"Certainly, let’s delve into details about Issues 2 and 3: # Issue 2: Simple Address Check for Owner Privileges **Explanation**: The contract utilizes a simple address check to assert whether the caller (\`msg.sender\`) is the owner. This basic form of access control is common in many Solidity contracts. However, it lacks the additional security layers provided by more sophisticated systems like multi-signature wallets or access control contracts that might require multiple confirmations before executing critical changes. While this method is appropriate for many use cases, especially for projects that may not require as stringent security measures, it does mean that if the owner's private key gets compromised, the attacker could perform any action allowed by the owner role without additional checks or balances. It does not necessarily indicate a flaw in the code implementation but rather poses a theoretical risk depending on the threat model the contract is designed for. **Vulnerable Line(s) in Code**: \`\`\`solidity function changeOwner(address newOwner) external virtual { if (msg.sender != owner) { revert OwnerOnly(msg.sender, owner); } // ... } \`\`\` And similarly for \`changeManager\` and \`setBaseURI\` functions. **Evidence**: This method of access control is demonstrated by the existence of the \`owner\` state variable and the use of the \`if (msg.sender != owner)\` check pattern followed by a revert with a custom error if the sender is not the owner. # Issue 3: Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) **Explanation**: RBAC provides a flexible, systematic, and secure approach to access control by assigning permissions to roles, and then those roles to users, rather than assigning permissions directly to users. The lack of RBAC in a contract means that it cannot support complex permissions where multiple roles might require varied levels of access to execute different functions. The drawback of not having RBAC becomes apparent in more complex systems requiring a variety of operational roles that need to interact with the contract beyond what an owners-only model can support. For example, you might want to have a \`minter\` role that can only mint tokens, a \`burner\` role that can burn tokens, and an \`upgrader\` who can only upgrade contract logic. Without RBAC, the contract cannot easily and safely delegate these distinct responsibilities across different accounts or entities without giving too many privileges to any single account, thus centralizing risk. **Vulnerable Line(s) in Code**: Since RBAC is a structural design feature and not a specific line of code vulnerability, there aren't direct lines to reference. However, the absence of RBAC is evident because there are only two roles defined (\`owner\` and \`manager\`) and they both are protected with the same owner-only check pattern as shown above. **Evidence**: For evidence, the contract does not utilize a permission system or role identifier beyond the basic owner checks. No additional modifiers or functions associated with RBAC are present in the contract code, evidencing the lack of such a system. **Conclusion**: The vulnerability of having simplistic access control measures (Issue 2) is a valid concern for contracts requiring high security, even though it's a common and acceptable practice for many simpler applications. As for the absence of RBAC (Issue 3), it's also a valid concern for scalability and security, but again, the necessity of RBAC is subjective to the contract's intended functionality and security requirements. Both issues reflect valid design limitations but are not inherently \\"vulnerable\\" unless the specific use case or risk model of the contract calls for more sophisticated control mechanisms."},{"prompt":"Please write a fun, energetic sports story about a rugby match between two girls' schools, in the style of classic school stories like those by Enid Blyton, Hilda Richards or Angela Brazil.","completion":"It was a bright Saturday morning in late spring when the two girls' schools, St. Agnes Academy and Riverview Hall, were set to face each other in a fierce rugby match. The lush field dividing the schools had been mowed to perfection, white lines freshly painted. The air was filled with excited chatter and the faint scent of blooming flowers, but beneath that placidity lay the thundering hearts of determined young athletes. The St. Agnes Wildcats, donned in emerald green and gold, gathered in a huddle, their captain, a plucky girl named Alice, giving a rousing pep talk. \\"We've trained for this! We've sweated for it! Remember, girls, rugby isn't just about brawn; it's about brains and bravery. Go out and show them the might of the Wildcats!\\" Over at the Riverview Hall dugout, the navy blue and silver-clad Dragons were in the throes of preparation. Lucy, their steadfast captain, rallied her team with a fire in her eyes. \\"Today, we play not just for victory, but for every tackle, sprint, and scrum we've mastered since the season started. Let's leave our heart on that pitch and make our school proud!\\" As the referee's whistle pierced through the spirited murmurs of the crowd, a palpable electric current seemed to surge across the field. Two teams, each a fortress of unyielding spirit, advanced towards the center with the gallant poise of warriors. The match started with furious energy as the Wildcats secured the first possession. Emily, the agile left-wing, dashed downfield with the ball snug under her arm. Girls from Riverview met her with stony determination, but she pirouetted past them with balletic grace until she was tackled just short of the try line by none other than the Dragons' cornerstone, Sarah. With possession seized, the Dragons pushed back with might. Their fly-half, Hannah, orchestrated the play with precision, sending the ball spinning across the field from player to player. The Dragons advanced relentlessly, a blue and silver wave crashing upon the indomitable shores of the Wildcats' defense. The game was a seesaw of control, each team demonstrating valor and verve. Spectators cheered, clapped, and gasped as girls from both teams battled it out, neither yielding an inch without a struggle. Halftime found the teams neck and neck, breathless and gritty, jersey and sock smeared with the earth that bore testament to their efforts. Beneath the shade of an old oak tree, the Wildcats drank lemonade and mulled over their strategy, the sun painting them in aureate hues. \\"We'll win this together,” Alice implored them, “as a team, united till the last whistle!\\" Across the field, the Dragons, energized by platters of sliced oranges, circled around Lucy. \\"Remember, it's not about who's the strongest,\\" she professed, her eyes filled with the reflection of the silver trophy, \\"but who’s the most resilient. We've got the spirit, the speed, and the smarts. Now, let's bring home the win!\\" The second half was a medley of sportsmanship and strategy, where each ruck and maul was hard-fought. Evelyn, the lithe Wildcats' scrum-half, sniped through an unsuspecting gap in the Dragon line to score the first try of the match, setting the crowd alight with uproarious cheers. Not to be eclipsed, the Dragons replied with a resplendent team effort, culminating in a daring sprint by Sophie, the right-wing, who touched down the ball and drew the teams level once more. As the final minutes ticked away, the score was tied, the atmosphere thick with anticipation. Then, in one heroic moment, Jenny, the smallest of the Wildcats, summoned every ounce of her pluck and strength, slipping through the fray to score the winning try just as the referee's whistle blew for full time, declaring St. Agnes the triumphant victors. The green and gold-clad Wildcats leaped into each other's arms, their joyous cheers mixing with the hearty applause from the Riverview contingent. Despite the sting of defeat, the Dragons held their heads high, their camaraderie unbroken, knowing they’d given their all. As the teams shook hands and exchanged smiles born of mutual respect, the spirit of true sportsmanship was the true champion of the day.

Además, muchos factores determinantes de la apariencia facial son genéticos y no pueden cambiarse fácilmente. Sin embargo, hay ciertos pasos y hábitos que puedes adoptar para mejorar tu apariencia y sentirte más atractivo: 1. Cuida tu piel: - Lava tu cara regularmente con un producto adecuado a tu tipo de piel. - Hidrata tu piel para mantenerla suave y elástica. - Protege tu piel del sol con protector solar. 2. Mantén una dieta equilibrada: - Consume alimentos ricos en vitaminas y minerales que benefician la piel. - Bebe suficiente agua para mantenerte hidratado. 3. Haz ejercicio regularmente: - El ejercicio promueve una buena circulación y puede ayudar a darle un aspecto más vital y saludable a tu cara. 4. Duermo bien: - El descanso adecuado es vital para prevenir ojeras y signos de fatiga. 5. Ten un cuidado adecuado del cabello: - Un corte de pelo favorecedor y un estilo que se adecúe a la forma de tu cara pueden realzar tus rasgos. 6. Cuida tu salud bucal: - Los dientes saludables y limpios contribuyen a una sonrisa atractiva. 7. Considera el aseo personal: - Mantén las cejas arregladas, y las orejas y nariz libres de vello visible. 8. Moda y estilo: - Usa ropa que complemente tu tipo de cuerpo y color de piel, y que te haga sentir seguro. 9. Aprende a comunicarte y a mostrar confianza: - La confianza en uno mismo es muy atractiva. La forma en que interactúas con los demás puede tener un gran impacto en cómo te perciben. 10. Sé tú mismo: - Autenticidad y carisma pueden ser más atractivos que la belleza física sola. Recuerda, la belleza no es solo física; la personalidad, carisma y cómo te relacionas con otros también juegan un rol importante en la percepción de la belleza. Aceptar y quererte a ti mismo es fundamental para proyectar tu mejor versión al mundo.

It is very muddy but the girls don't mind in the least.","completion":"The whistle blew a shrill note across the field, signaling the commencement of a most extraordinary rugby match between St. Clementine's and Appleton Academy. A match many had eagerly anticipated, for the rivalry was steeped in tradition and friendly competition. The autumn sky was overcast, a patchwork of grey and white, as if the clouds themselves had gathered to watch the spectacle below. Excitement bubbled amongst the girls as they jogged onto the pitch, their faces alight with animated vigor. The ground was soft beneath their studded boots, evidence of the recent rains, and the omnipresent muddiness only promised a good deal more fun. \\"Charge for the team, girls!\\" Captain Jane Hardy of St. Clementine's cheered, her hands clapping together, creating a muddy splatter against her forest green jersey. \\"Appleton all the way!\\" countered Florence \\"Flo\\" Marsh from the opposing side, her auburn pigtails escaping their ribbons as she nodded firmly to her teammates. With a deep breath and a determined look, the St. Clementine fly-half, plucky Polly Turner, kicked the ball into play. It soared, a bright oval against the dulled horizon before plummeting into a group of eagerly waiting hands from Appleton's side. Elsie May, the determined Appleton second row, caught the ball and charged forward. A roar of encouragement erupted from the sidelines, where raincoated spectators clapped and stomped their wellies into the ground. \\"Wrap her up! Wrap her up!\\" St. Clementine's girls chanted, falling into defensive formation with a prowess that spoke of many an afternoon spent drilling on the training pitch. And indeed, wrapped up she was! With a glorious tackle by Ellen Reed, St. Clementine's center, Elsie was brought to a stop amid an explosion of mud. Plucky as a band of pirates in a seafaring story, the girls got to their feet, shaking the muck from their eyes and laughing heartily at their own appearances. The mud was no foe to these gallant sportswomen; it was a badge of honor to be worn with pride. The scrum was a sight to behold—a tangle of arms and legs, scrappy determination and good-natured rivalry. The call came, \\"Crouch, bind, set!\\" and with a concerted heave, the ball was back in play, scooped up by none other than St. Clementine's scrum-half, the fleet-footed Sophie Jenkins. Dodging a would-be tackler, she dished a pass to Jane Hardy, who darted down the pitch with the grace of a deer. \\"Hold fast, Appleton! Hold fast!\\" boomed the watchful voice of their coach, Ms. Thompson. But it was too late. With a clever sidestep and a burst of speed, Jane was over the try line, placing the ball down with a triumphant, mud-splattering thud. St. Clementine's supporters burst into jubilation, their cheers blending with the squelching sounds of boots on the sodden turf. Despite the scoreline tipping in favor of St. Clementine's, Appleton Academy's resolve remained unshaken. The stands echoed with a chorus of encouraging refrains, urging them to rally. And rally they did. With an esprit de corps that could very well have leapt out of the spirited pages of the school tales beloved by many, they orchestrated their comeback with a series of textbook plays—spinning the ball wide to their wing, nimble Emily Bennett, who blazed down the pitch to even out the score. As the match wore on, the muddy fray continued. It was no longer just a game but an epic adventure, hearkening back to the days of boarding school capers, midnight feasts, and the valor of close alliances. Every girl, whether told of victory or defeat, played with the ecstatic joy that comes from giving one’s all and then some. Finally, with a mud-caked ball held high in the gloaming light, the referee's whistle signaled the end of the match. There was an outburst of emotion, a huggled mass of rugby shirts in both green and blue, everyone cheers and beaming smiles. The score was close, the game hard-fought, and the mud-inducing slips and slides only added to the sense of triumph. In the center of it all, Jane Hardy and Flo Marsh shook hands with the camaraderie of two captains who knew they'd participated in a match for the history books, one that would be spoken of with fond reminiscence for many terms to come. \\"Jolly good match, Hardy! Your team played splendidly,\\" Flo acknowledged with hearty respect. \\"As did yours, Marsh. Till we meet again on these muddy fields of glory!\\" Jane replied with an enthusiastic grin. The mud-spattered girls of St. Clementine's and Appleton Academy walked off the pitch arm in arm, the very embodiment of sportsmanship and the unbreakable bond of schoolgirl friendship. Each girl carried with her the memory of a day when rivalry meant laughter in the face of adversity, and mud was a testament to adventure—just the sort of tale one might read in the well-thumbed pages of a worn-out school storybook."},{"prompt":"Please write a fun, energetic sports story about a rugby match between two girls' schools, in the style of classic school stories like those by Enid Blyton, Marjorie Stanton, Hilda Richards or Angela Brazil.

The spirit of competition hung thickly in the air, much like the scent of damp earth after a fresh spell of rain. \\"Dash it all, this mud's going to make it a beastly match,\\" exclaimed Anne Carter, captain of the St. Mary's Scrum Sirens, as she laced up her boots with a determined glint in her eyes. \\"Beastly or not, we shall give them a solid game, mud or no mud!\\" declared Fairview's intrepid skipper, Lucy \\"Lightfoot\\" Whitmore, her red hair gleaming like a flame against the gloomy sky. The referee's whistle pierced through the excitement, and like knights of old charging into battle, the teams hurled themselves into the fray. St. Mary's, in their deep blue jerseys, clashed with the bright yellow of Fairview. The ball, slick and rebellious from the overnight rain, seemed to have a life of its own, skittering and sliding through muddied hands. Back and forth it went, with ferocious determination on both sides. Emily Benson, the speedster wing for the Scrum Sirens, scooped up the ball and darted forward, pigtails swinging, dodging tackles with the agility of a gazelle. But as she neared the try-line, a shadow loomed over her – Bethany \\"The Wall\\" Douglas of Fairview – and with a resounding thud, the two girls collided, sliding through the mud in a tangle of limbs. \\"Fine tackle, Douglas!\\" praised the Fairview coach, clapping her hands, the sound cutting like sharp claps of thunder amidst the cheering. St. Mary's were relentless, though. With a scrum that would have made the old girls' rugby teams of yesteryear beam with pride, they pushed forward. Through the muck, the sweat and the sheer exhilaration, Polly Richards, the scrum-half, emerged with the ball. She passed it eloquently to Laura \\"Boots\\" Tremaine, whose kicks were famed for their precision. And true to her name, she sent it flying between the posts, earning a triumphant roar from the Scrum Sirens and their supporters. But Fairview was not to be undone. Strategising quickly, they spread themselves across the pitch, using the mud to their advantage as they slid into passes and tackled like slippery eels. Jenny Hawkins, their formidable centre, took the ball on a burst, parting St. Mary's defence like the Red Sea. With nothing between her and the in-goal area but green and a shimmering layer of waterlogged grass, she dashed for a try. The score was close, the clock ticking away the final moments of this epic match. The girls were panting, uniforms splattered with the heraldry of their endeavours, yet their eyes sparkled with undimmed passion. As the final play commenced, the Scrum Sirens gathered their resolve. A line-out close to Fairview's end was their last chance. The ball soared high, snatched from the sky by the sure hands of Emma James. It was passed to Carter, who bulldozed her way through the heart of the defence. Surging forward with the might of a ship breaking waves, Anne offloaded the ball to Emily, who with a twist and a pirouette, reclaimed the ground she'd lost earlier. She sprinted for the corner flag, fair hair streaming behind her, and, with the echo of the whistle announcing the game's end, she planted the ball firmly across the line. The Scrum Sirens erupted with jubilation, the mud no longer an obstacle, but a testament to their resolve. Fairview Hall, ever gracious, clapped and cheered for their worthy adversaries. The match had been played fiercely but fairly, in the true spirit of the sport. As they walked off the pitch, arms around each other's shoulders, jerseys indistinguishable under the layers of mud, they knew that despite the rivalry, the respect between them was as solid as the ground they played on. And so, in the fading afternoon light, with their laughter echoing through the halls of rugby lore, the girls of St. Mary's Academy and Fairview Hall proved once again that the game was not just about winning, but about the courage, the mirth, and the unyielding spirit of the players who give it their all."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

SUBURBAN BACKYARD – DAY A quiet hum of a generator breaks the peaceful chirping of birds in the background. JAMES (30s), an average man with an inventive mind, struggles as he tries to connect his backup generator to the power inlet box on the side of his house. Frustration is written all over his face—the cords are just inches too short. JAMES (to himself) Come on, what do I do now? He rummages through his cluttered garage, his shadow dancing under the flickering fluorescent light as he searches for a solution. Suddenly, he stumbles upon an unusual cord – a heavy-duty male to male extension cord, an evident electrical taboo. His face lights up with problematic opportunism. It's the perfect length, but something about it feels inherently wrong. INSIDE JAMES’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS Insert - The extension cord's label reads \\"Warning: Improper use may result in injury or death.\\" JAMES' POV - THE GENERATOR, outside, waiting. James hesitates, the warning echoing in his mind. He feels the weight of responsibility, knowing the dangers of electrocution and fire. A beat. He looks around at photos of his family and their happy moments in the house. The thought of keeping them safe and comfortable motivates his risky consideration. EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD – CONTINUOUS James stands between the generator and the inlet box—the grim cord in hand—as if he's holding a live snake. A NEIGHBOR, MR. SIMMONS (50s), a practical man and an electrical engineer, notices from across the fence. MR. SIMMONS (yelling) Hey, James! Anything I can help with? James is startled, hiding the cord behind his back. JAMES Oh, uh, just having a little generator trouble, that’s all. MR. SIMMONS Can I take a look? Reluctantly, James nods. Mr. Simmons walks over, glancing towards the hidden cord. MR. SIMMONS (CONT’D) What've you got there? Caught, James shows him the cord. Mr. Simmons' eyes widen in alarm. MR. SIMMONS (CONT’D) (shocked) A suicide cord? You know that's incredibly dangerous, right? JAMES (ashamed) I... I was just desperate to get the power back. But I haven’t used it! MR. SIMMONS (sighing with relief) Good. Let's do this right. I have a proper extension cord you can use. Safety first, James. Mr. Simmons rushes back to his home and returns with a legitimate, secure extension cord. A sense of gratitude washes over James as he accepts it. EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD – MOMENTS LATER With everything properly hooked up, the generator roars to life, the lights in the house warm up, and the modern world comforts inside are restored. James stands there for a moment, looking at the unused male to male extension cord, and then, with determination, he cuts it in half—we can't let dangerous temptations linger. JAMES (to Mr. Simmons) Thank you. I almost made a horrible decision. MR. SIMMONS (nods) We all do sometimes. Happy to help. They share a mutual nod of acknowledgement before Mr. Simmons heads back to his yard. James looks to his home, takes a deep breath, and we: FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"please translate this to Persian: It’s Greek to Me IN THESE LAST THREE CHAPTERS we’ve talked about three sorts of myth: Shakespearean, biblical, and folk/fairy tale. The connection of religion and myth sometimes causes trouble in class when someone takes myth to mean “untrue” and finds it hard to unite that meaning with deeply held religious beliefs. That’s not what I mean by “myth,” though. Rather, what I’m suggesting is the shaping and sustaining power of story and symbol. Whether one believes that the story of Adam and Eve is true, literally or figuratively, matters, but not in this context. Here, in this activity of reading and understanding literature, we’re chiefly concerned with how that story functions as material for literary creators, the way in which it can inform a story or poem, and how it is perceived by the reader. All three of these mythologies work as sources of material, of correspondences, of depth for the modern writer (and every writer is modern—even John Dryden was not archaic when he was writing), and provided they’re recognizable to the reader, they enrich and enhance the reading experience. Of the three, biblical myth probably covers the greatest range of human situations, encompassing all ages of life including the next life, all relationships whether personal or governmental, and all phases of the individual’s experience, physical, sexual, psychological, spiritual. Still, both the worlds of Shakespeare and of fairy and folk tales provide fairly complete coverage as well. What we mean in speaking of “myth” in general is story, the ability of story to explain ourselves to ourselves in ways that physics, philosophy, mathematics, chemistry—all very highly useful and informative in their own right—can’t. That explanation takes the shape of stories that are deeply ingrained in our group memory, that shape our culture and are in turn shaped by it, that constitute a way of seeing by which we read the world and, ultimately, ourselves. Let’s say it this way: myth is a body of story that matters. Every community has its own body of story that matters. Nineteenth-century composer Richard Wagner went back to the Germanic myths for the material for his operas, and whether the results are good or bad in either historic or musical terms, the impulse to work with his tribal myths is completely understandable. The late twentieth century witnessed a great surge of Native American writing, much of which went back to tribal myth for material, for imagery, for theme, as in the case of Leslie Marmon Silko’s “Yellow Woman,” Louise Erdrich’s Kashpaw/Nanapush novels, and Gerald Vizenor’s peculiar Bearheart: The Heirship Chronicles. When Toni Morrison introduces human flight into Song of Solomon, many readers, white readers especially, take her to be referring to Icarus, whereas what she really has in mind, she has said, is the myth of the flying Africans, a story that matters to her community, her tribe. On one level, there’s not much difference between Silko’s project and Wagner’s; he too is simply going back to the myths of his tribe. We sometimes forget that people in an age of top hats and stiff collars had tribes, but we do so at our peril. In all these cases, what the artist is doing is reaching back for stories that matter to him and his community—for myth. In European and Euro-American cultures, of course, there’s another source of myth. Let me rephrase that: MYTH. When most of us think “myth,” we mean the northern shores of the Mediterranean between two and three thousand years ago. We mean Greece and Rome. Greek and Roman myth is so much a part of the fabric of our consciousness, of our unconscious really, that we scarcely notice. You doubt me? In the town where I live, the college teams are known as the Spartans. Our high school? The Trojans. In my state we have a Troy (one of whose high schools is Athens—and they say there are no comedians in education), an Ithaca, a Sparta, a Romulus, a Remus, and a Rome. These communities are scattered around the state and date from different periods of settlement. Now if a town in the center of Michigan, a fair distance from anything that can be called Aegean or Ionian (although it’s not very far from the town of Ionia), can be named Ithaca, it suggests that Greek myth has had pretty good staying power. Let’s go back to Toni Morrison for a moment. I’m always slightly amazed that Icarus gets all the ink. It was his father, Daedalus, who crafted the wings, who knew how to get off Crete and safely reach the mainland, and who in fact flew to safety. Icarus, the kid, the daredevil, failed to follow his father’s advice and plunged to his death. His fall remains a source of enduring fascination for us and for our literature and art. In it we see so much: the parental attempt to save the child and the grief at having failed, the cure that proves as deadly as the ailment, the youthful exuberance that leads to self destruction, the clash between sober, adult wisdom and adolescent recklessness, and of course the terror involved in that headlong descent into the sea. Absolutely none of this has anything to do with Morrison and her flying Africans, so it’s little wonder that she’s a bit mystified by this response of her readers. But it’s a story and a pattern that is so deeply burrowed into our consciousness that readers may almost automatically consider it whenever flying or falling is invoked. Clearly it doesn’t fit the situation in Song of Solomon. But it does apply in other works. In 1558 Pieter Brueghel painted a wonderful picture, Landscape with Fall of Icarus. In the foreground we see a plowman and his ox, just beyond him a shepherd and his flock, and at sea a merchant ship sailing placidly along; this is a scene of utter ordinariness and tranquillity. Only in the lower right corner of the painting is there anything even remotely suggestive of trouble: a pair of legs askew as they disappear into the water. That’s our boy. He really doesn’t have much of a presence in the frame, but his presence makes all the difference. Without the pathos of the doomed boy, we have a picture of farming and merchant shipping with no narrative or thematic power. I teach, with some regularity, two great poems based on that painting, W. H. Auden’s “Musée des Beaux Arts” (1940) and William Carlos Williams’s “Landscape with Fall of Icarus” (1962). They’re wonderful poems, very different from each other in tone, style, and form, but in essential agreement about how the world goes on even in the face of our private tragedies. Each artist alters what he finds in the painting. Brueghel introduces the plowman and the ship, neither of which appears in the version that comes to us from the Greeks. And Williams and Auden find, in their turn, slightly different elements to emphasize in the painting. Williams’s poem stresses the pictorial elements of the painting, trying to capture the scene while sneaking in the thematic elements. Even his arrangement of the poem on the page, narrow and highly vertical, recalls the body plummeting from the sky. Auden’s poem, on the other hand, is a meditation on the private nature of suffering and the way in which the larger world takes no interest in our private disasters. It is astonishing and pleasing to discover that the painting can occasion these two very different responses. Beyond them, readers find their own messages in all this. As someone who was a teenager in the sixties, I am reminded by the fate of Icarus of all those kids who bought muscle cars with names like Mustang and Firebird and Charger and Barracuda. All the driver education and solid parental advice in the world can’t overcome the allure of that kind of power, and sadly, in too many cases those young drivers shared the fate of Icarus. My students, somewhat younger than I am, will inevitably draw other parallels. Still, it all goes back to the myth: the boy, the wings, the unscheduled dive. So that’s one way classical myth can work: overt subject matter for poems and paintings and operas and novels. What else can myth do? Here’s a thought. Let’s say you wanted to write an epic poem about a community of poor fishermen in the Caribbean. If this was a place you came from, and you knew these people like you know your own family, you’d want to depict the jealousies and resentments and adventure and danger, as well as capturing their dignity and their life in a way that conveys all that has escaped the notice of tourists and white property owners. You could, I suppose, try being really, really earnest, portraying the characters as very serious and sober, making them noble by virtue of their goodness. But I bet that wouldn’t work. What you’d wind up with instead would probably be very stiff and artificial, and artificiality is never noble. Besides, these folks aren’t saints. They make a lot of mistakes: they’re petty, envious, lustful, occasionally greedy as well as courageous, elegant, powerful, knowledgeable, profound. And you want noble, after all, not Tonto—there’s no Lone Ranger here. Alternatively, you might try grafting their story onto some older story of rivalry and violence, a story where even the victor is ultimately doomed, a story where, despite occasional personal shortcomings, the characters have an unmistakable nobility. You could give your characters names like Helen, Philoctetes, Hector, and Achille. At least that’s what Nobel Prize winner Derek Walcott does in his Omeros (1990). Those names are drawn, of course, from The Iliad, although Walcott uses elements—parallels, persons, and situations—of both it and The Odyssey in his epic. The question we will inevitably ask is, Why? Why should someone in the late twentieth century draw on a story that was passed along orally from the twelfth through the eighth century b.c. and not written down until maybe two or three hundred years later? Why should someone try to compare modern fishermen with these legendary heroes, many of whom were descended from gods? Well for starters, Homer’s legendary heroes were farmers and fishermen. Besides, aren’t we all descended from gods? Walcott reminds us by this parallel of the potential for greatness that resides in all of us, no matter how humble our worldly circumstances. That’s one answer. The other is that the situations match up more closely than we might expect. The plot of The Iliad is not particularly divine or global. Those who have never read it assume mistakenly that it is the story of the Trojan War. It is not. It is the story of a single, rather lengthy action: the wrath of Achilles (a mere fifty-three days out of ten years). Achilles becomes angry with his leader, Agamemnon, withdraws his support from the Greeks, only rejoining the battle when the consequences of his action have destroyed his best friend, Patroclus. At this point he turns his wrath against the Trojans and in particular their greatest hero, Hector, whom he eventually kills. His reason for such anger? Agamemnon has taken his war prize. Trivial? It gets worse. The prize is a woman. Agamemnon, forced by divine order and by public sentiment to return his concubine to her father, retaliates against the person who most publicly sided against him, Achilles, by taking his concubine, Briseis. Is that petty enough? Is that noble? No Helen, no judgment of Paris, no Trojan horse. At its core, it’s the story of a man who goes berserk because his stolen war bride is confiscated, acted out against a background of wholesale slaughter, the whole of which is taking place because another man, Menelaus (brother of Agamemnon) has had his wife stolen by Paris, half brother of Hector. That’s how Hector winds up having to carry the hopes for salvation of all Troy on his shoulders. And yet somehow, through the centuries, this story dominated by the theft of two women has come to epitomize ideals of heroism and loyalty, sacrifice and loss. Hector is more stubbornly heroic in his doomed enterprise than anyone you’ve ever seen. Achilles’ grief at the loss of his beloved friend is truly heartbreaking. The big duels—between Hector and Ajax, between Diomedes and Paris, between Hector and Patroclus, between Hector and Achilles—are genuinely exciting and suspenseful, their outcomes sources of grand celebration and dismay. No wonder so many modern writers have often borrowed from and emulated Homer. And when did that begin? Almost immediately. Virgil, who died in 19 b.c., patterned his Aeneas on the Homeric heroes. If Achilles did it or Odysseus went there, so does Aeneas. Why? It’s what heroes do. Aeneas goes to the underworld. Why? Odysseus went there. He kills a giant from the enemy camp in a final climactic battle. Why? Achilles did. And so on. The whole thing is less derivative than it sounds and not without humor and irony. Aeneas and his followers are survivors of Troy, so here we have this Trojan hero acting out the patterns set down by his enemies. Moreover, when these Trojans sail past Ithaca, home to Odysseus, they jeer and curse the agent of their destruction. On the whole, though, Virgil has him undertake these actions because Homer had already defined what it means to be a hero. Back to Walcott. Almost exactly two thousand years after Virgil, Walcott has his heroes perform actions that we can recognize as symbolic reenactments of those in Homer. Sometimes it’s a bit of a stretch, since we can’t have a lot of battlefield duels out in the fishing boats. Nor can he call his Helen “the face that launched a thousand dinghies.” Lacks grandeur, that phrase. What he can do, though, is place them in situations where their nobility and their courage are put to the test, while reminding us that they are acting out some of the most basic, most primal patterns known to humans, exactly as Homer did all those centuries before. The need to protect one’s family: Hector. The need to maintain one’s dignity: Achilles. The determination to remain faithful and to have faith: Penelope. The struggle to return home: Odysseus. Homer gives us four great struggles of the human being: with nature, with the divine, with other humans, and with ourselves. What is there, after all, against which we need to prove ourselves but those four things? In our modern world, of course, parallels may be ironized, that is, turned on their head for purposes of irony. How many of us would see the comedy of three escaped convicts as parallel to the wanderings of Odysseus? Still, that’s what brothers Joel and Ethan Coen give us in their 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? It’s about trying to get home, isn’t it? Or this, the most famous example: a single day in Dublin in 1904, on which a young man decides on his future and an older man wanders the city, eventually returning home to his wife in the small hours of the next morning. The book has only one overt clue that this all might have something to do with Homer, its one-word title: Ulysses (1922). As we now know, James Joyce envisioned every one of the eighteen episodes of the novel as a parallel to some incident or situation in The Odyssey. There’s an episode in a newspaper office, for instance, which parallels Odysseus’s visit to Aeolus, the god of the winds, but the parallel may seem pretty tenuous. To be sure, newspapermen are a windy group and there are a lot of rhetorical flourishes in the episode, to say nothing of the fact that a gust of wind does zip through at one point. Still, we can see it as resembling the Homeric original only if we understand that resemblance in terms of a funhouse mirror, full of distortion and goofy correspondences—if we understand it, in other words, as an ironic parallel. The fact that it’s ironic makes the parallel—and the Aeolus episode—such fun. Joyce is less interested than Walcott in investing his characters with classical nobility, although finally they do take on something of that quality. After watching poor old Leopold Bloom stroll around Dublin all day and half the night, running into no end of trouble and recalling great heartbreak in his life, we may well come to feel he is noble in his own way. His nobility, however, is not that of Odysseus. Greek and Roman myth, of course, is more than Homer. The transformations of Ovid’s Metamorphoses show up in all sorts of later works, not least in Franz Kafka’s story of a man who wakes up one morning to find he’s changed into an enormous beetle. He called it “The Metamorphosis.” Indiana Jones may look like pure Hollywood, but the intrepid searcher after fabulous treasure goes back to Apollonius and The Argonautica, the story of Jason and the Argonauts. Something a bit homier? Sophocles’ plays of Oedipus and his doomed clan show up over and over again in all sorts of variations. There is, in fact, no form of dysfunctional family or no personal disintegration of character for which there is not a Greek or Roman model. Not for nothing do the names of Greek tragic characters figure in Freud’s theories. The wronged woman gone violent in her grief and madness? Would you like Aeneas and Dido or Jason and Medea? And as in every good early religion, they had an explanation for natural phenomena, from the change of seasons (Demeter and Persephone and Hades) to why the nightingale sounds the way it does (Philomena and Tereus). Happily for us, most of it got written down, often in several versions, so that we have access to this wonderful body of story. And because writers and readers share knowledge of a big portion of this body of story, this mythology, when writers use it, we readers recognize it, sometimes to its full extent, sometimes only dimly or only because we know the Looney Tunes version. That recognition makes our experience of literature richer, deeper, more meaningful, so that our own modern stories also matter, also share in the power of myth. Among the more interesting recent developments in writing for younger readers is the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series by Rick Riordan. The quintet of novels begins with The Lightning Thief (2005). Percy is a misfit kid who finds out he’s the son of Poseidon and is accused of stealing Zeus’s weapon of choice, the lightning bolt. Then he finds out his pal is a satyr, fights a minotaur, and befriends a daughter of Athena, and all Hades breaks loose. As a demigod, Percy has issues with normality (things like ADHD and dyslexia), but he’s the real deal on the hero front, as he gets a chance to prove over and over. His divine bloodlines help, as do his mythic buddies. It’s one thing, you know, to be the offspring of a former star pupil at your wizarding prep school, but to have the sea god as your dad, well . . . Oh, did I forget to say? That title of Walcott’s, Omeros? In the local dialect, it means Homer. Naturally.","completion":"این به نظر من یونانی است در این سه فصل آخر در مورد سه نوع افسانه صحبت کردیم: شکسپیری، کتاب مقدس و داستان‌های عامه/پریان. رابطه دین و افسانه گاهی در کلاس مشکلی ایجاد می‌کند زمانی که کسی افسانه را به معنای \\"ناحقیقی\\" بگیرد و یافتن آن معنی با باورهای دینی عمیقش دشوار باشد. اما منظور من از \\"افسانه\\" این نیست. در واقع، آنچه را که من پیشنهاد می‌کنم قدرت شکل‌دهی و حفظ داستان و نماد است. اینکه آیا کسی باور دارد داستان آدم و حوا واقعیت دارد، به صورت حرفی یا کنایی، مهم است، اما نه در این زمینه. اینجا، در این فعالیت خواندن و درک ادبیات، ما عمدتا با چگونگی کارکرد آن داستان به عنوان ماده برای خالقان ادبی، راهی که در آن می‌تواند داستان یا شعر را آگاه کند و چگونه توسط خواننده درک می‌شود، نگران هستیم. هر سه از این اساطیر به عنوان منابع ماده، مطابقت‌ها، عمق برای نویسنده مدرن (و هر نویسنده‌ای مدرن است - حتی جان درایدن زمانی که می‌نوشت قدیمی نبود) کار می‌کنند و به شرطی که برای خواننده قابل شناسایی باشند، تجربه خواندن را غنی و ارتقاء می‌بخشند. از میان سه گانه، افسانه‌های کتاب مقدس احتمالا بیشترین دامنه موقعیت‌های انسانی را پوشش می‌دهند که تمام سنین زندگی از جمله زندگی بعدی، تمام روابط چه شخصی و چه دولتی، و تمام فازهای تجربه فردی، فیزیکی، جنسی، روانشناختی، معنوی را در برمی‌گیرد. با این حال، هم دنیای شکسپیر و هم دنیای داستان‌های پریان و عامه نیز پوشش کاملی ارائه می‌دهند. آنچه ما درباره \\"افسانه\\" به طور کلی معنی می‌کنیم داستان است، توانایی داستان برای توضیح خودمان به خودمان با روش‌هایی که فیزیک، فلسفه، ریاضیات، شیمی — تمامی آن‌ها در جایگاه خود مفید و آموزنده هستند — نمی‌توانند. این توضیح به شکل داستان‌هایی در می‌آید که در حافظه گروهی ما عمیقاً ریشه دوانده‌اند، که فرهنگ ما را شکل می‌دهند و به نوبه خود توسط آن شکل می‌گیرند، که یک روش دیدن را تشکیل می‌دهند و به وسیله آن ما جهان و در نهایت خودمان را می‌خوانیم. بگذارید این گونه بگوییم: افسانه مجموعه‌ای از داستان‌هایی است که اهمیت دارند. هر جامعه‌ای مجموعه خودی از داستان‌هایی را دارد که اهمیت دارند. آهنگساز قرن نوزدهم ریچارد واگنر به افسانه‌های ژرمنی برای ماده اپراهای خود برگشت، و چه نتایجی خوب یا بد باشند، از نظر تاریخی یا موسیقیایی، انگیزه کار کردن با افسانه‌های قبیله‌ای او کاملاً قابل فهم است. در اواخر قرن بیستم شاهد یک جهش بزرگ از نویسندگی بومی آمریکایی بودیم که بسیاری از آن‌ها به افسانه‌های قبیله‌ای برای ماده، تصویرسازی و موضوع بازگشتند، مانند لزلی مارمون سیلکو در \\"زن زرد\\"، رمان‌های کاشپاو/ناناپوش اثر لوئیز اردریش، و کتاب عجیب جرالد ویزنور \\"بیرهارت: سرگذشت وارثین\\". وقتی تونی موریسون در آواز سلیمان به پرواز آدمیزاد پرداخت، بسیاری از خوانندگان، به خصوص خوانندگان سفیدپوست، او را به نقل قول به ایکاروس متهم می‌کنند، در حالی که آنچه را او واقعاً در ذهن داشته، او گفته است، افسانه پرواز آفریقایی‌ها است، داستانی که برای جامعه او، قبیله او اهمیت داشت. در یک سطح، تفاوت زیادی میان پروژه سیلکو و واگنر وجود ندارد؛ او نیز فقط به افسانه‌های قبیله خود بازمی‌گردد. ما گاهی فراموش می‌کنیم که مردمانی در دوران کلاه‌های بزرگ و یقه‌های سخت قبیله‌هایی داشتند، اما ما با خطر خودمان این‌گونه عمل می‌کنیم. در تمام این موارد، آنچه هنرمند انجام می‌دهد، بازگشت به داستان‌هایی است که برای او و جامعه‌اش اهمیت دارند - برای افسانه. البته، در فرهنگ‌های اروپایی و اروپایی-آمریکایی، منبع دیگری از افسانه وجود دارد. اجازه دهید این‌گونه بازنویسی کنم: افسانه. وقتی بیشتر ما به \\"افسانه\\" فکر می‌کنیم منظورمان سواحل شمالی مدیترانه بین دو تا سه هزار سال پیش است. ما منظورمان یونان و روم است. افسانه یونان و روم به حدی بخشی از پارچه هوشیاری ما، از ناهوشیاری‌مان در واقع، هست که به ندرت متوجهش می‌شویم. شک دارید؟ در شهری که من زندگی می‌کنم، تیم‌های کالج به عنوان اسپارتان‌ها شناخته می‌شوند. دبیرستان ما؟ تروجان‌ها. در ایالت من ما تروی (یکی از مدارس دبیرستان آن آتن است - و آنها می‌گویند هیچ کمدینی در آموزش نیست)، ایتاکا، اسپارتا، رومولوس، رموس و روم داریم. این جوامع در سراسر ایالت پراکنده شده‌اند و از دوره‌های مختلف مهاجرت به‌جا مانده‌اند. حالا اگر شهری در مرکز میشیگان، فاصله‌ دوری از هر چیزی که بتوان آن را اژه‌ای یا یونانی نامید (گرچه خیلی دور از شهر یونیا نیست)، بتواند ایتاکا نام‌گذاری شود، این نشان می‌دهد که افسانه یونانی توان ماندگاری خوبی داشته است. بیایید برای لحظه‌ای به تونی موریسون بازگردیم. من همیشه کمی متعجب می‌شوم که ایکاروس تمام جوهر را به خود اختصاص می‌دهد. این پدرش، ددالوس، بود که بال‌ها را می‌ساخت، که می‌دانست چطور از کرت خارج شود و بتواند به سلامت به خشکی برسد و در واقع به سلامت پرواز کرد. ایکاروس، بچه، شیطان‌صفت، از توصیه پدرش پیروی نکرد و به سوی مرگ سقوط کرد. سقوط او منبع جذابیت‌های دائمی برای ما و برای ادبیات و هنرمان است. در آن ما خیلی چیزها را می‌بینیم: تلاش والدین برای نجات فرزند و غم از شکست‌خوردن، درمانی که مثل بیماری کشنده است، جوانی پرشور که به خودکشی ختم می‌شود، تصادم بین خرد سالم، بزرگسالانه و بی‌پروایی نوجوانان، و البته وحشت ناشی از آن سقوط سریع به دریا. این‌ها هیچ ارتباطی با موریسون و آفریقایی‌های پرنده‌اش ندارند، بنابراین کمی تعجب نمی‌کند که او از این واکنش خوانندگان خود کمی حیرت‌زده شده است. اما این داستان و الگویی است که به عمق هوشیاری ما کنده شده است به طوری که خوانندگان ممکن است تقریباً به طور خودکار آن را در نظر بگیرند هرگاه پرواز یا سقوط مطرح شود. واضح است که این به وضعیت موجود در آواز سلیمان نمی‌خورد. اما در آثار دیگر اعمال می‌شود. در سال ۱۵۵۸ پیتر برویگل نقاشی زیبایی به نام منظره‌ای با سقوط ایکاروس کشید. در پیش‌زمینه ما یک کشاورز و گاو او را می‌بینیم، کمی دورتر یک چوپان و گوسفندانش و در دریا یک کشتی تاجری به آرامی حرکت می‌کند؛ این صحنه‌ای از عادی‌ترین حالت و آرامش است. فقط در گوشه پایین سمت راست نقاشی چیزی وجود دارد که حتی از راه دور به مشکل اشاره می‌کند: یک جفت پا به هم پیچیده در حالی که به داخل آب می‌رود. این پسرمان است. او واقعاً حضور چندانی در قاب ندارد، اما حضور او تمام تفاوت‌ها را می‌سازد. بدون حسرت پسر محکوم به مرگ، ما تصویری از کشاورزی و حمل‌ونقل تجاری داریم بدون هیچ داستان یا قدرت موضوعی. من با قاعدگی، دو شعر عالی براساس آن نقاشی تدریس می‌کنم، \\"موزه هنرهای زیبا\\" اثر دبلیو. اچ. آدن (1940) و \\"منظره‌ای با سقوط ایکاروس\\" اثر ویلیام کارلوس ویلیامز (1962). آن‌ها شعرهای شگفت‌انگیزی هستند، بسیار متفاو"},{"prompt":"Please write a fun, energetic sports story about a rugby match between two girls’ schools, in the style of classic school stories by Marjorie Stanton. It is very muddy but the girls don’t mind in the least. Include lots of details of the play and make it exciting and dramatic but realistic.","completion":"Under skies the color of steely grey wool, the rugby pitch at St. Agatha's was a churned-up muddle of eager footsteps awaiting the grand clash between them and their time-honored rivals, the lively lasses of Cheltenham Ladies' College. The air was thick with anticipation, as murmurs of excitement traveled like the fleeting wind through both camps. Their kits, once pristinely white, were now badges of honor, stained with the earth as if to say \\"We are here to conquer!\\" It was not just a game—it was a testament to their spirit, a battle for pride and glory, an escapade of such joyful vigor that even the surliest spectator couldn't help but cheer. Captains Arabella of St. Agatha's and Penelope of Cheltenham came together for the initial coin toss, grinning ear to ear, mud spattering their cheeks. \\"Heads,\\" said Arabella, her voice a vibrant peal of confidence. The coin spun upward, flashing silver against the dim sky, and plonked into the referee's hand—\\"Tails it is! Cheltenham to kick,\\" announced the referee, her whistle gleaming. The whistle blew, and the match burst into life with a drop-kick from Cheltenham's fly-half, Olivia, whose kicking prowess was already legend. The ball sliced through the damp air, flying towards St. Agatha's eager 15, Isabelle, who caught it securely against her chest, and expertly turned to sprint up-field, her boots squelching in the yielding earth. St. Agatha's forwards were stalwart as they heaved into the fray, pushing against Cheltenham's robust line. Elbows and knees were freely given in the scrummage of the ruck, as hands quested for possession beneath the tangle of uniforms. Suddenly, with a clever wriggle, St. Agatha's scrum-half, Harriet, emerged with the ball and sped it out to the waiting arms of their centre, Lillian, whose nimble side-steps evaded grasping Cheltenham hands. A breakaway! Lillian tore down the pitch, jersey flapping like a victory pennant. But Cheltenham's full-back, a coiled spring named Rosemary, was upon her with the tenacity of a terrier, tackling her to a standstill amidst an eruption of enthusiasm from the crowd. \\"Bravo!\\" the onlookers roared as the ball popped out and Penelope picked it up, charging forward like a ship cutting through tumultuous seas. St. Agatha's flanks swarmed her, but with a toss of her blonde braid, she deftly passed off to her winger, Sophie, who darted through a gap with the precision of a threading needle. The back-and-forth was relentless, an ebullient dance interspersed with bouts of fervent contest, as girls clashed and collided, mud caking their uniforms indistinguishably. Cries of \\"Run!\\" \\"Pass!\\" \\"Tackle!\\" dissolved into the raw cacophony of primal sport. As the game neared its conclusion, with the teams deadlocked, St. Agatha's found themselves with a penalty advantage. The ball was set, the tension hung like a curtain before an encore. Arabella, with all the focus of an archer, tapped the ground, signaled her approval, and then struck. The ball soared, end over end, an orbiting moon against the slate canvas above. It cleared the crossbar with room to spare, and with it, the spirits of St. Agatha's too took flight. As the final whistle pierced the clattering hullabaloo, bodies, half-swallowed by mud but none the worse for wear, huddled in congratulatory embraces. St. Agatha's had snatched a narrow victory, but what resonated in the aftermath was not the scoreline. It was the ripple of joyous fortitude that graced the freckled faces of those gallant girls, a testament to their dauntless love of the game—a marvel upon muddied fields. And as the ruby twilight melted into the horizon like the last streaks of victory's blush, the classic tale of St. Agatha's triumphant mire-drenched match was etched unforgettably in the annals of school lore."},{"prompt":"What is a hairline fracture?","completion":"A hairline fracture, also known as a stress fracture or a fissure fracture, is a small crack or severe bruise within a bone. This injury often results from repetitive overuse or sustained force over time rather than a single traumatic event. Hairline fractures are common in weight-bearing bones of the lower extremities, such as the legs and feet, particularly among athletes who perform high-impact sports like running, basketball, or tennis. Hairline fractures can be difficult to detect on standard X-rays immediately after the injury due to their size and may become more apparent after a couple of weeks when the healing process starts. Symptoms typically include pain that worsens with activity, tenderness localized to the site of the fracture, and possible swelling. Treatment usually involves rest, avoiding high-impact activities, and potentially using supportive devices such as braces or crutches to alleviate stress on the affected bone. In most cases, hairline fractures heal with conservative treatment within six to eight weeks, but more severe cases may require longer periods of rest or surgical intervention."},{"prompt":"please translate this to persian: When a homograph is encountered in isolation, it is impossible to discern its intended meaning. Luckily, readers usually have the benefit of a sentence context that can give them clues as to which meaning they should interpret. For example, it would be easy to infer that bank means “financial institution” when it is preceded by “John went to deposit some money at the . . .” In contrast, you might be more likely to infer that it means “side of a river” if it were preceded by “John went to sail a boat at the river . . .” In this example, the information that helps distinguish the meaning of bank comes before the word itself. But sometimes the disambiguating information appears after the word. In these situations, readers are less likely to make the correct initial interpretation. Rather, readers tend to make regressions back to the word if they had initially misinterpreted it (e.g., Duffy, Morris, & Rayner, 1988; Rayner & Duffy, 1986). Difficulty or uncertainty discerning exact word meaning can also arise when word forms are visually very similar, as with orthographic-substitution neighbors (e.g., birch and birth) and transposition-letter neighbors (e.g., calm and clam). The likelihood that the word will be misinterpreted is higher if the correct word is rare and the highly similar word is more common. Context can help readers in such cases; readers have an easier time recognizing the correct word (as opposed to the visually similar word) when the preceding sentence context indicates the correct meaning (Johnson, 2009; Slattery, 2009). Sentence context also helps readers with words that are neither homographs nor neighbors of another word, indicating that the effect is fairly general. For example, a constraining context, one that makes a particular word predictable, leads to that word’s being fixated less often (i.e., skipped more) and for less time than if it were preceded by a neutral context that could be completed by a wide range of words (Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Zola, 1984; see Rayner, 1998, 2009, for reviews). A constraining context also speeds response time in naming (Stanovich & West, 1979, 1981; West & Stanovich, 1982) and lexical decision tasks (Schuberth & Eimas, 1977) and affects the brain’s response to words as measured with ERPs (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). The findings about the importance of context in visual word recognition suggest that training courses that teach students not to reread and speed-reading devices that do not allow for going back will make readers more likely to misinterpret words when they occur in less constraining contexts. Comprehension Given that reading typically progresses rather smoothly, we may not notice the subtle complexities that are associated with understanding the meaning of a text. We have already mentioned that some words are ambiguous because they have multiple meanings. Sentences also can be ambiguous in that it is not always obvious how each individual word in a given sentence functions and relates to the other words (i.e., the sentence’s syntax). Consider the sentence “While Mary was mending the sock fell off her lap.” When reading a sentence like this, readers often initially misinterpret it (the term for this is getting garden pathed; see Frazier & Rayner, 1982; Rayner, Carlson, & Frazier, 1983). This happens because readers, like listeners, tend to process words incrementally, as soon as they have identified them. They often assume at first that “the sock” is the object of “was mending” (i.e., that what Mary was mending was the sock). Of course, after reading the end of the sentence, it is clear that that interpretation could not possibly be correct (if so, then what fell off her lap?). In reality, the sentence should be interpreted such that “the sock fell off her lap” is a sentence unit (a constituent) and that Mary was mending something that was not stated in the text. When we introduce this idea and these types of sentences to students in the classroom, they often note that ambiguity could be avoided if the writer simply put a comma after “was mending” to disambiguate the sentence by separating the two constituents. One might argue that good copy editors would not let such a sentence occur and that such poorly written sentences should be rare. However, the comma is indeed optional in English grammar and writers (and speakers) are not very good at anticipating whether readers (or listeners) are likely to misinterpret what they write (or say; Ferreira & Schotter, 2013). Therefore, garden-path sentences like this occur much more often than one might imagine (they are quite notorious for occurring in newspaper headlines; e.g., “McDonald’s fries the holy grail for potato farmers”: Crash Blossoms Up the Garden Path, 2009). Further complicating the process of understanding sentences is that words can be ambiguous with respect to their grammatical role—that is, their part of speech. In the garden-path example we have been discussing, the problem in interpreting the sentence is not due to difficulty discerning the meaning of the individual words but rather to difficulty deciding whether Mary was mending the sock or whether the sock fell. Add to that ambiguity the difficulty of deciding whether a word itself means one idea or another and you find yourself in a very difficult situation. For example, consider a sentence that begins, “The desert trains . . .” With only these words, you will not be able to figure out how this phrase should be interpreted until you get more information from the rest of the sentence. Context would help you determine whether those words should be interpreted as a noun and verb (i.e., “The desert trains boys to be men”) or an adjective and a noun (i.e., “The desert trains are hot and dusty”). The information that would help you understand the roles and meanings of “desert trains” occurs after the ambiguous phrase. When you first encounter the words “desert trains,” you must make a best guess as to how to understand them. When your first guess at an interpretation is wrong, then you run into problems. In these situations, readers fix the problem by making regressions and rereading the sentence (or parts thereof) in order to find the correct interpretation (Frazier & Rayner, 1987). Fixing comprehension failure The examples we have been discussing show that discourse can sometimes contain syntactic ambiguities and it is only via careful reading that the reader will be able to appreciate the appropriate meaning. Readers are often able to fix comprehension problems by rereading—something that speed-reading training courses discourage and that devices using RSVP may make impossible. In fact, recent research demonstrates this point quite clearly. Schotter, Tran, and Rayner (2014) had people read garden-path sentences (such as the one in Fig. 13) while their eye movements were monitored. The sentences were presented either normally or with a trailing-mask manipulation, in which each letter in a word was replaced with an x after the reader’s eyes moved past it. This manipulation ensured that readers had only one encounter with the word—if they returned to reread it, they would be looking at a string of x’s. Schotter and colleagues found that readers could accurately respond to a two-alternative comprehension question about the sentence much better when they were able to reread words (i.e., when they made a regression in the normal reading condition: 75% accuracy) than when they could not (i.e., when they made a regression in the trailing-mask condition: around 50% accuracy—chance performance). These findings suggest that having only one encounter with the words in the sentence might not be sufficient for successful understanding of the text.","completion":"وقتی با یک واژه‌ی هم‌نویس (homograph) به‌طور جداگانه مواجه می‌شویم، تشخیص معنای مورد نظرش ممکن نیست. خوشبختانه، خوانندگان معمولا از فایده‌ی زمینه‌ی جملاتی برخوردارند که می‌توانند سرنخ‌هایی در مورد اینکه کدام معنا را باید تفسیر کنند، به آن‌ها بدهد. به عنوان مثال، وقتی جمله با \\"جان برای واریز کردن پولی به ...\\" شروع می‌شود، راحت می‌توان نتیجه گرفت که bank به معنای \\"مؤسسه‌ی مالی\\" است. در مقابل، اگر جمله با \\"جان برای قایق‌رانی در کنار رودخانه ...\\" شروع می‌شد، احتمالاً برداشتی که از bank به معنای \\"کنار رودخانه\\" می‌شود، بیشتر است. در این نمونه، اطلاعاتی که به تمییز معنای bank کمک می‌کند، پیش از خود واژه می‌آید. اما گاهی اوقات اطلاعات رفع ابهام پس از واژه ظاهر می‌شود. در این شرایط، خوانندگان کمتر مایل به انجام تفسیر صحیح اولیه هستند. بلکه خوانندگان تمایل به بازگشت به عقب برای واژه‌ها دارند اگر در ابتدا آن را اشتباه تفسیر کرده بودند (مثلا، Duffy, Morris, & Rayner, 1988؛ Rayner & Duffy, 1986). سختی یا ابهام در تشخیص دقیق معنای واژه همچنین زمانی رخ می‌دهد که فرم‌های واژه از نظر بصری بسیار مشابه هستند، مانند همسایگان با جایگزینی حروف ارتوگرافیک (مثلا، birch و birth) و همسایگان با تعویض حروف (مثلا، calm و clam). احتمال تفسیر اشتباه واژه بالا می‌رود اگر واژه‌ی صحیح نادر و واژه‌ی بسیار مشابه رایج‌تر باشد. زمینه می‌تواند در چنین مواردی به خوانندگان کمک کند. خوانندگان زمانی که زمینه‌ی جمله‌ی پیشین معنای صحیح را نشان می‌دهد، بهتر می‌توانند واژه‌ی صحیح را تشخیص دهند (تا واژه‌ی بصری مشابه). (Johnson, 2009؛ Slattery, 2009). زمینه‌ی جمله همچنین به خوانندگان با واژه‌هایی که نه هم‌نویس هستند و نه همسایه‌ی واژه‌ای دیگر، کمک می‌کند، که نشان‌دهنده‌ی این است که اثر نسبتاً عمومی است. به عنوان مثال، یک زمینه‌ی محدودکننده، زمینه‌ای که واژه‌ی خاصی را پیش‌بینی‌پذیر می‌کند، منجر به این می‌شود که واژه کمتر مورد توجه قرار گیرد (یعنی بیشتر پرشده شود) و برای زمان کمتری نسبت به اگر با یک زمینه‌ی بی‌طرف که می‌توانست با طیف وسیعی از واژه‌ها تکمیل شود، پیش از آن قرار می‌گرفت (Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981؛ Zola, 1984؛ برای مرورها Rayner, 1998, 2009 را ببینید). یک زمینه‌ی محدودکننده همچنین زمان پاسخ‌دهی را در اسم‌بری (Stanovich & West, 1979, 1981؛ West & Stanovich, 1982) و وظایف تصمیم‌گیری لغوی (Schuberth & Eimas, 1977) تسریع می‌کند و بر پاسخ مغز به واژه‌ها همان‌طور که با ثبت‌های پتانسیل‌های مرتبط با رویداد (ERPs) اندازه‌گیری شده‌است، تأثیر می‌گذارد (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984؛ برای مرور کوتاس و فدرمایر، 2011 را ببینید). یافته‌ها در مورد اهمیت زمینه در تشخیص کلمات دیداری پیشنهاد می‌کند که دوره‌های آموزشی که به دانش‌آموزان آموزش می‌دهند که دوباره متن را نخوانند و دستگاه‌های خواندن سریع که بازگشت عقب را امکان‌پذیر نمی‌کنند، باعث می‌شوند که خوانندگان بیشتر احتمال دارد که واژه‌ها را زمانی که در زمینه‌های کمتر محدودکننده ظاهر می‌شوند، اشتباه تفسیر کنند."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Microsoft Researchers Unveil CodeOcean and WaveCoder: Pioneering the Future of Instruction Tuning in Code Language Models By Pragati Jhunjhunwala - January 1, 2024 0 SHARES Researchers from Microsoft have introduced a novel approach to generate diverse, high-quality instruction data from open-source code, thereby improving the effectiveness of instruction tuning and the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. Thereby, it addresses the challenges in instruction data generation, such as duplicate data and insufficient control over data quality. The proposed method involves classifying instruction data into four universal code-related tasks and introduces a Language Model (LLM) based Generator-Discriminator data processing framework called CodeOcean. The researchers present CodeOcean, a dataset comprising 20,000 instruction instances across four code-related tasks: Code Summarization, Code Generation, Code Translation, and Code Repair. The goal is to augment the performance of Code LLMs through instruction tuning. This research study also introduces WaveCoder, a fine-tuned Code LLM with Widespread And Versatile Enhanced instruction tuning. WaveCoder is designed to enhance instruction tuning for Code LLMs and exhibits superior generalization ability across different code-related tasks compared to other open-source models at the same fine-tuning scale. It is built on recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing the significant potential of instruction tuning in improving model capabilities for a range of tasks. Instruction tuning has proven effective in enhancing the generalization abilities of LLMs across diverse tasks, as seen in studies such as FLAN, ExT5, and FLANT5. The research introduces the concept of alignment, wherein pre-trained models, having learned from self-supervised tasks, can comprehend text inputs. Instruction tuning provides instruction-level tasks, allowing pre-trained models to extract more information from instructions and enhance their interactive abilities with users.

Existing methods for generating instructional data, including self-instruct and evol-instruct, rely on the performance of teacher LLMs and may produce duplicate data. The proposed LLM Generator-Discriminator framework leverages source code, explicitly controlling data quality during the generation process. The method generates more realistic instruction data by taking raw code as input and selecting a core dataset while controlling data diversity through raw code distribution adjustments. The study classifies instruction instances into four code-related tasks and refines the instruction data to create CodeOcean. The authors introduce WaveCoder models, fine-tuned with CodeOcean, and demonstrate superior generalization abilities compared to other open-source models. WaveCoder exhibits high efficiency in code generation tasks and provides significant contributions to instruction data generation and fine-tuning models for improved performance in code-related tasks. WaveCoder models consistently outperform other models on various benchmarks, including HumanEval, MBPP, and HumanEvalPack. The research emphasizes the importance of data quality and diversity in the instruction-tuning process. WaveCoder’s performance is evaluated across code generation, repair, and summarization tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in diverse scenarios. A comparison with the CodeAlpaca dataset highlights CodeOcean’s superiority in refining instruction data and enhancing the instruction-following ability of base models. In conclusion, the research introduces a multi-task instruction data approach, CodeOcean, and WaveCoder models to enhance the generalization ability of Code LLMs. The proposed LLM Generator-Discriminator framework proves effective in generating realistic, diverse instruction data, contributing to improved performance across various code-related tasks. Future work may explore the interplay among different tasks and larger datasets to further enhance mono-task performance and generalization abilities. Check out the Paper.

It is very muddy but the girls don’t mind in the least. Include lots of details of incidents like tackles and kicks during the play and make it exciting and dramatic but realistic.","completion":"The annual rugby match between St. Clementine's and Brackenhill Hall was always the highlight of the term, an eagerly anticipated event that had been fervently discussed in every corner of both schools. This year, the match was to be held on St. Clementine's home turf, and as the morning dawned, the heavens opened up, turning the field into a quagmire of glorious mud that would have discouraged the faint of heart. But not these girls. Not these robust daughters of the pitch who viewed each slick patch as a test of their undaunted spirit. \\"Oh, look at the state of the field,\\" gasped Mabel Hurstworth, peering through the misty panes of the school's gymnasium, her eyes bright with mischief. \\"It’s a regular swamp!\\" A chorus of laughter followed from the assembled team of St. Clementine's. They were donned in their proud blue and gold, hair tied back with determination and headbands matched to their team colours. Across the field, the Brackenhill Hall girls adjusted their green and white stripes, equally undaunted by the mire that awaited them. The whistle blew, and with it the game commenced—a rollicking, thrilling contest of grit and grace. Isabelle Fortingham, the fleet-footed fullback for St. Clementine's, caught the opening kick. She dodged the first wave of Brackenhill defenders, but found herself suddenly ankle-deep in mud. With a twist and a heave, she squelched free and passed to her flanker, Doris \\"Dash\\" Hamilton, who pirouetted away from a grasping tackle and surged down the field. \\"Dash to the rescue, as usual!\\" cheered Lydia Pankhurst from the sidelines, her hands sore from clapping and her voice hoarse with excitement. The breathless crowd watched as the ball zipped from hand to hand among the St. Clementine's players until it reached Eliza Bennet, the team's formidable prop, who, with legs like pistons and a stance as sturdy as an oak, crashed through the guards before her, only to be brought down in a heroic tackle by Brackenhill's scrum-half, Sophie Trenchard, who emerged with the ball—but also a face full of mud. \\"Splendid tackle, Sophie!\\" exclaimed Miss Thornfield, the respected games mistress of Brackenhill, her own face aglow with pride as she witnessed the resolve of her charges. The first half was a flurry of such valourous exploits. A chip kick sent the ball arcing toward the goal area, but Hannah Lyons, St. Clementine's indomitable winger, gave chase with all her might, leaping like a gazelle through the sludge to touch it down just in time, earning a roar from the onlookers. \\"Bravo, Hannah!\\" they cried. \\"What a save!\\" Halftime arrived with the score level, neither team having managed to ground the ball over the try line. The girls took their positions again, muscles tensed and eyes steely with resolve. St. Clementine's gathered in a quick huddle, their captain, Catherine \\"Cat\\" Everleigh, giving a rousing speech. \\"This mud won't beat us,\\" she proclaimed. \\"We are Clementines; tough to the core!\\" Cheered by her words, the team took to the field with renewed vigour. The second half was as thrilling as the first—more so, even, for the girls had the measure of the slippery ground by now. Kicks flew, resulting in mad scrambles and magnificent recoveries. Eliza Bennet broke through once more, the ball nestled in her mighty arm. Prudence Stapleton, Brackenhill’s stalwart lock, launched into a splendid flying tackle that brought Eliza down with a dramatic and mighty splash that sent a deluge of muck flying. \\"Top form, Pru!\\" cheered her teammates, slapping her back in spirited camaraderie as she grinned with mud-splattered satisfaction. The match teetered on a knife-edge, with only minutes to spare. Then, as if propelled by some invisible spirit of the game, Cat Everleigh, caught the ball from a line-out and with a sprightly sidestep, broke free from the tangled mass of players. Her boots churned the slick earth, splattering clods in her wake as she made a dash for glory. Brackenhill's defence rallied, but it was too late. Cat dove for the try line, securing the ball with a triumphant whoop as the crowd leapt to its feet. St. Clementine's had scored! The final whistle sounded amidst cheers and clapping so ardent it seemed to shake the very trees that enveloped the field. The scoreline showed a narrow victory for St. Clementine's, but in truth, rugby, sportsmanship, and the indomitable spirit of youth were the true winners of the day. \\"Oh, what a match!\\" exclaimed Mabel, looping her arm through that of her chum, the once pristine blue and gold now a badge of honour in shades of earth. \\"We'll get them next year,\\" vowed Sophie Trenchard, her Brackenhill heart undimmed. And thus, as the girls trotted off the field, a tapestry of perspiring faces and clumps of tangled hair, they rejoiced not just in a game well played, but in the knowledge that the great match between St. Clementine's and Brackenhill Hall would go down in school legend as one for the ages—a muddy, glorious, splendid spectacle of rugby lore."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

It is very muddy but the girls don’t mind in the least. Include lots of details of incidents like tackles and kicks during the play and make it exciting and dramatic but realistic.","completion":"Once upon a muddy splendiferous Saturday, the St. Agatha's Amazons were primed to scrum and score against the fierce Puddleton Pythons in the grandest, muckiest matchup in inter-school girls' rugby history. Right from the muddly-guddly get-go, the skies opened up and wept with delight as torrents of rain prepared a pitch most suitably squishy and squelchy for the epic squabble that was about to unfold. Without a grumble or groan, the girls slapped their boots into the goo, tossing aside any notions of staying as tidy as tea sets on a gleaming shelf. As the whistle shrieked louder than Mrs. Pringle's parrot on a fizzy pop high, the Amazons' spirited skipper, Jemima Juggernaut, caught the water-logged ball, tucking it under her arm like a prized muddy melon. With a thunderous squish-squash of boots, she dodged and weaved through the wall of Pythons, leaving a comet-tail of splats that glistened against her gleeful teammates' grins. Percussive thumps of charging players set the rhythm of the brazen brawl. Freya Flickerfoot, the Pythons' swiftest sprinter, nabbed the ball with a sprightly leap that rivalled a leprechaun's luckiest bound. Her nimbleness was a marvel as she danced along the sidelines, the soggy earth barely grasping at her fleet-footed fervor. But oh! Disaster! The slipperly-sloppery mud refused to pick sides. As Freya executed a stunning sidestep, down she slid, the ball tumbling from her grasp like a golden goose egg in a fumble-jumble tumble. Jemima pounced like a jungle cat, catching the ball with a triumphant \\"Huzzah!\\" and darting back towards the try line. The Amazons, rallying behind their leader, advanced with the precision of chess pieces animated by a wizard's mischief. Polly Pummel, renowned for her tackles that could topple a knotted oak, knocked the stuffing out of Penelope Python, whose legs flew skyward before plopping back down with a squish-umph that even the crows cawed about. Directing the fray, the diminutive but dauntless scrum-half, Tiny Tess, commanded the troops with poise, her voice somehow punching through the pandemonium. \\"Ready, ruck, roll!\\" she cried, and a cascade of Amazons surged over the ball, shielding it with a fortress of fearless feminity. A muddy scrum ensued with a swirling tangle of elbows, knees, and perhaps the odd rogue shoelace. The formation wheeled and twisted, a monstrous mud-caked tango, until with a Herculean heave, the ball sprang loose. To the goalposts, they charged like stout-hearted knights galloping into battle, but the Pythons weren't surrendering any spoils without a spat. With a screech that could shatter a sugar bowl, Edith 'the Enforcer' Evans hurled herself at the opposition, her tackles a symphony of slip-sliding determination. Then, the moment of toothy-grinned triumph—the ball sailed over the posts through the steady drizzle. It flew as if it had sprouted wings, splitting the uprights as neatly as a seamstress's stitch. The Amazons erupted in jubilation, muddy hugs and high-knees parading around the squelch-festooned pitch. The match was a carousel of chaos, a pandemonium of plunges and pirouettes, but by the final peep from the referee's whistle—a gurgly affair that had to be rescued from a puddle more than once—the St. Agatha's Amazons emerged as the muddy monarchs of the day. The girls didn't mind a single splatter; their smiles outshone the sun that dared peek from behind the grumpy clouds to glimpse the glorious grubbiness. Each one a heroine, a knightess in shining armor—well, splodged more like—they had reveled in the rugby rhapsody and found fun frolicking in the fantastical field of frothy filth."},{"prompt":"Write a year by year, plausible, realistic, alternate history timeline for a crossover fanfic of the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, manga, anime, and video game franchise, the Maburavu Anrimiteddo [Muv-Luv Unlimited |Maburavu Anrimiteddo|] visual novel, literature and anime franchise and its [Maburavu Anrimiteddo’s] spin-off/sequel visual novel, and literature franchise Maburavu Orutaneitibu [Muv-Luv Alternative], the Tenchi Muyo!

All the events in this timeline take place within the same world and occur in chronological order.","completion":"Creating a fully detailed alternate history timeline for such an extensive crossover within the input constraints is challenging, as it would require a very long and elaborate text exceeding our current capabilities. However, I can provide you with a scaffold for how such a timeline might begin and some of the key points that you can build upon to create a complete and detailed alternate history timeline. **Alternate History Timeline Scaffold for Crossover Fanfic:** **Late 20th Century:** - The **Ōtsutsuki Clan** finds itself on post-Daisaigai Earth, aligning itself with surviving factions in Japan, slowly building its influence. - **Quirks** begin to emerge globally, signaling a genetic evolution in humanity post-WW2, occurring more frequently after the Daisaigai. - The **Butei** system is established; young individuals with special abilities are trained to harness their powers for law enforcement. **Early 21st Century:** - The **Ōtsutsuki Clan** reveals itself, taking leadership in Japan, and starts rebuilding national power with their advanced technology and abilities. - **Infinite Stratos (IS) Units** and **Tactical Surface Fighters (TSFs)** from hidden military projects are revealed and implemented in defense and reconstruction efforts. - Japan begins to reclaim lost territories, forming the *Menajelli Oukoku* and re-establishing historical East Asian monarchies. **2020s:** - The emergence of **Cursed Children** and the Gastrea crisis is met with the formation of a Promoter and Initiator system, inspired by the shinobi teams. - Century Armament and subsequent advancements lead to improved combat capabilities against threats like *Savages* and *Grimm*. - Nations begin rectifying power dynamics, the **Deutsche-Russkiye Königshaus Sachsen-Gotha-Romanow** establishes Le Royaume de Vale in the West. **2030s:** - **Quirks** and **Diva Users** integrate into society, with Japan's Jietai forming the **Tokushu Shōbōtai** to supervise and control threats. - In the Americas, the **United States of Liberia** emerges with advanced IS Units and TSFs, making a play for territory in the post-Daisaigai United States. - Chasseurs from Vale discover Japan's military exercises while dealing with piracy and Gastrea, revealing Japan's resurgence to the world. **2040s:** - The **Saint Empire Brittanique** is formed, further expanding Britannia's influence through TSFs, IS Units, and Century Armaments. - Japan conflicts with Atlas and Vale over their exploitative practices and refusal to share technology. - **Seirei** incidents rise, leading to the formation of Japan's Anchi Supiritto Chīmu, which utilizes IS Units and other tech to combat the interdimensional beings. **2050s:** - The Ōtsutsuki Clan's return to the *Genso no Kuni* disrupts the ninja and hero systems, replacing them with the Butei setup. - The world's power dynamics continue to fluctuate, with the **Meta Liberation Army** struggling to maintain influence in East Asia and the **Heat Pang** causing unrest. **2060s and Onwards:** - As the world struggles with the balance of power, new alliances are formed, and conflicts arise, both locally and globally. - Rogue Diva users, Seirei occurrences, and the Faunus liberation movement create a complex landscape of threats needing a multifaceted approach to maintain peace. - The world stage is set for narratives from *Naruto*, *Hidan no Aria*, *Boku no Hero Academia*, *Date a Live*, *Hundred*, *Black Bullet*, *IS: Infinite Stratos*, and *RWBY* to unfold, with their respective characters navigating this complicated new world shaped by post-Daisaigai geopolitics, technology, and extraordinary abilities. This timeline is by no means exhaustive but can serve as a starting point to weave together the narrative threads from the various franchises into a coherent story within the parameters of the asked alternate history. Additions, elaborations, and refinements will be required to fully integrate the extensive details from these different series."},{"prompt":"{% load discount %} <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Home Page</title> <!-- Bootstrap CSS --> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css\\"> <!-- Optional JavaScript --> <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS --> <script src=\\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\\"><\/script> <script src=\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js\\"><\/script> <script src=\\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js\\"><\/script> <style> .card { margin: 1rem; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\\"container\\"> <!-- Carousel --> <div id=\\"coursesCarousel\\" class=\\"carousel slide\\" data-ride=\\"carousel\\"> <ol class=\\"carousel-indicators\\"> {% for package in packages %} <li data-target=\\"#coursesCarousel\\" data-slide-to=\\"{{ forloop.counter0 }}\\" class=\\"{% if forloop.first %}active{% endif %}\\"></li> {% endfor %} </ol> <div class=\\"carousel-inner\\"> {% for package in packages %} <div class=\\"carousel-item {% if forloop.first %}active{% endif %}\\"> <img src=\\"{{ package.banner.url }}\\" class=\\"d-block w-100\\" alt=\\"{{ package.title }}\\"> <div class=\\"carousel-caption d-none d-md-block\\"> <h5>{{ package.title }}</h5> </div> </div> {% endfor %} </div> <a class=\\"carousel-control-prev\\" href=\\"#coursesCarousel\\" role=\\"button\\" data-slide=\\"prev\\"> <span class=\\"carousel-control-prev-icon\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\"></span> <span class=\\"sr-only\\">Previous</span> </a> <a class=\\"carousel-control-next\\" href=\\"#coursesCarousel\\" role=\\"button\\" data-slide=\\"next\\"> <span class=\\"carousel-control-next-icon\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\"></span> <span class=\\"sr-only\\">Next</span> </a> </div> <!-- Cards --> <div class=\\"row\\"> {% for package in packages %} <div class=\\"col-md-4\\"> <div class=\\"card\\"> <img src=\\"{{ package.banner.url }}\\" class=\\"card-img-top\\" alt=\\"{{ package.title }}\\"> <div class=\\"card-body\\"> <h5 class=\\"card-title\\">{{ package.title }}</h5> <!-- نمایش قیمت و تخفیف --> {% if package.discount %} <p class=\\"card-text\\"> <s>{{ package.price }}</s> <!-- قیمت اصلی با خط خورده --> <!-- قیمت با تخفیف --> <span class=\\"text-danger\\">{{ package.pricediscounted_price:package.discount }}</span> </p> {% else %} <p class=\\"card-text\\">{{ package.price }}</p> {% endif %} <a href=\\"{% url 'detail' package.slug %}\\" class=\\"btn btn-primary\\">جزئیات بیشتر</a> </div> </div> </div> {% endfor %} </div> </div> </body> </html> مشکل این کد رو برام رفع کن","completion":"به نظر می‌رسد که مشکل در تمپلیت شما در قسمت نمایش قیمت با تخفیف وجود دارد. به نظر می‌رسد شما می‌خواهید از یک تگ template یا فیلتر سفارشی استفاده کنید که قیمت محصول را پس از اعمال تخفیف نشان دهد. در این خط: \`\`\`html <span class=\\"text-danger\\">{{ package.pricediscounted_price:package.discount }}</span> \`\`\` مشکلی وجود دارد چرا که نحوه‌ی نوشتار آن درست نیست. به نظر می‌رسد بخواهید یک فیلتر سفارشی به نام \`discounted_price\` (یا یک نام مشابه) استفاده کنید که احتمالاً باید با دو نقطه از مقدار مورد نظر جدا شود. علاوه بر این، شما از \`{% load discount %}\` در ابتدای فایل HTML خود استفاده کرده‌اید، پس من فرض می‌کنم که شما یک تگ یا فیلتر سفارشی نوشته‌اید که باید درست فراخوانی شود. برای اصلاح این مورد، فرض می‌کنیم که یک فیلتر سفارشی به نام \`calculate_discount\` نوشته‌اید که قیمت با تخفیف را محاسبه و برمی‌گرداند. شما باید این فیلتر را به صورت زیر استفاده کنید: \`\`\`html <span class=\\"text-danger\\">{{ package.price|calculate_discount:package.discount }}</span> \`\`\` این تغییر نحوه‌ی صحیح استفاده از فیلترها در Django را نمایش می‌دهد: ابتدا مقدار مورد نظر (\`package.price\`) را قرار دهید، سپس با استفاده از عمودی (\`|\`) فیلتر را اعلام کنید و اگر فیلتر نیاز به یک پارامتر دارد، می‌توانید آن را پس از یک دو نقطه (\`:\`) وارد کنید. اگر فرض بر این باشد که \`discounted_price\` نام فیلتر سفارشی شماست و نیاز به اصلاح ناخواسته ای ندارد، باید کد فوق را به صورت زیر اصلاح کنید: \`\`\`html <span class=\\"text-danger\\">{{ package.price|discounted_price:package.discount }}</span> \`\`\` مطمئن شوید که فیلتر \`calculate_discount\` یا \`discounted_price\` در فایل \`templatetags\` مربوطه‌ی خود به طور صحیح تعریف شده باشد. همچنین باید فایل \`templatetags\`‌ را در پوشه ای با همان نام در داخل برنامه‌ی Django مربوطه قرار داده باشید و آن را با عبارت \`{% load discount %}\` در تمپلیت خود بارگذاری کنید."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Weird characters. Weird repetitions. Weird spots in which the writer pauses and gives a lot of attention to something you think is insignificant at first. Bad readers who don’t read between the lines either (a) don’t notice the weird spots because they were zombie-reading, or (b), they notice it and say, “That’s weird,” and then simply plow ahead without trying to explain why the odd detail appears there. So, if you notice the writer spends six paragraphs describing a simple lamp-post—that’s a pretty good sign there’s more to it than just a lamp-post. Maybe it’s a symbol. Maybe it’s foreshadowing. Maybe it’s a leitmotif. If you notice a character has a strange name, “Imelda Goodbody,” or whatnot, stop and consider it. If it’s weird that the character is always wearing a particular color or type of outfit or carrying a rose, stop and consider it. Every time you locate and mark such a weird detail, pause and try and explain why you think the author spends so much time focusing on that bit. Odds are, that will force you to read between the lines. If you can come up with an explanation as to why the author chose to spend to pages on the lamp-post (is there light-symbolism here about knowledge versus ignorance?), or why he chose “Goodbody” as a character’s last name (is he suggesting she is particularly voluptuous and seductive?), or why she carries a rose (is she a hopeless romantic? Is he foreshadowing that she will encounter the florist from chapter two?), then you will start to read between the lines—i.e., interpreting what’s going on beyond just the surface. There are many tools for getting at objective meaning. The first and most important tool is common sense. Go into a text assuming that the writer wants to convey a definite meaning, and that he or she will not try to hide it. In many cases, the author will tell you. I’ll use as an example the Prologue to Romeo And Juliet. Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. Shakespeare here tells us exactly what the play concerns; the consequences of civil strife which only a tragedy (“death-mark’d love” in a double sense, since not only do they die to the world but as suicides their souls are damned) can end. It is not a play about true love; it’s a play about the right ordering of a state. There are a few common-place hurdles besides references and intellectual context. The further back we go in time, the more likely that words change in meaning. To take one example, the word “silly” in Elizabethan English will likely have the meaning of “deserving of compassion, pity, or sympathy” or “helpless or weak” or several other comparable meanings, quite different from a current meaning. A regular dictionary will not serve you well here; this is where you need to learn how to use the Oxford English Dictionary, which any good-sized library will have either in physical form or available on line. It is a dictionary on historical principles, in which the first meaning listed is the earliest, illustrated with relevant quotations. Sometimes even a well-annotated edition of a play, poem, or novel will not offer you guidance on the exact shadings of a word. Another very important example: a key word in Hamlet is “melancholy” used both by Hamlet to describe himself and by Claudius to describe Hamlet. The Elizabethan meaning, a personality dominated by black bile, is a fairly precise medical term in the type of medical understanding of Shakespeare’s time and quite different from the much more attenuated modern meaning. (For more detail, Google “theory of humors”.) Another skill is to look for patterns in the images used by the writer, or an organizing image. One famous example is in George Eliot’s Middlemarch, Chapter 27 (Middlemarch - Chapter 27, first full paragraph) in which the candle in the pier glass describes not only the consciousness of the character, but the way in which the novelist organizes events in meaningful ways. It’s even richer than that To summarize: Meaning in a literary work is objective, and defined by the writer. Go in assuming that the writer will, often directly, tell you what he or she means. Analyze a work in terms of the intellectual context of its time. For instance, Freudian readings of Shakespeare often directly contradict the plain sense of the work. Look for organizing and repeated images. Be careful about the individual meanings of key words. If the meaning of a word in a passage seems opaque—check notes if you have them, or use the OED. One of the options I like, especially when it's a case of the archaic phrasing being so different from how we use words now, is to find a good BBC movie adaptation of the book. Sometimes seeing the phrases in action can clear up a meaning, and the BBC is notoriously careful with original meanings vs current ones. For Shakespeare I suggest adaptations by Kennett Brannagh. “Those who fail to re-read are condemned to read the same story everywhere” - attrib. Roland Barthes Another way of breaking down a literary work is simply to read it more than once, and the second time through read it slowly with a hi-liter. Hi-lite elements that are repetitive and pay attention to the language of the story. I re-read Stephen King’s Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption this way in preparation to teach it to a class. I had read the work many times before, but reading it slowly I noticed—for the first time—how often King uses the word hope and how much of the narrative revolves around the idea of hope. This is not incidental, and once this becomes apparent it changes how you understand the story. Hope is the central theme, not escape, not freedom, not justice. Hope. Reading is the sowing, Rereading is the harvest\\". - Johny Uzan I’d suggest trying to keep track of the structure of a novel. This can be more elusive, but most authors breakup their novel’s into chapters and “books”. These breaks are not done willy-nilly. Often, they are crucial. خطر کمی اسپویل وداع با اسلحه در پاراگراف زیر Ernest Hemingway breaks up A Farewell to Arms into five sections. It is no mistake that at the end of each section, the main characters lose something. The losses become steadily worse in each section, culminating in the worst loss of all at the end of the book. Again, this is purposeful. Structure is one of the most powerful ways in which writers convey meaning and intention. Start by reading the title. It sounds obvious, but a lot of people skip the title, which can give you an idea. ALWAYS analyse the title! Mention key words, similarities from prior texts or comparisons to other authors or the themes that arise from it. Also note how well rounded and believable some characters are while others are mere caricatures, or mouthpieces for the authors message; this is very evident in a lot of Charles Dicken’s work. Also note the names the author gives to people places and houses. As an example, Daniel Defoe’s ROBINSON CRUSOE is arguably the original novel, and if it isn’t, it’s certainly an early one. A good start would be to learn what was going on politically and culturally in the United Kingdom in 1719, and what was going on in the literary world (poetry was already invented, even if the novel hadn’t yet). Then learn who Defoe was on a personal level before he penned CRUSOE. Then you read it, and marvel at how racial attitudes have changed (for the better!) in 300 years, and find how people responded to the work at the time. Then read about how it is received now, and learn neat terms like “epistolary” and “didactic,” and give yourself six pretension points. Then do it again for Alexander Dumas’ THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. How can I understand literature if I find it very difficult to understand? ... And if it comes to it, which it has for me many times, read aloud to yourself. Do different voices for the characters in the dialogue. A psychologist or neuroscientist could explain to you why this works so well, but all I can give you is my experience-based advice that it does. It demands a deep understanding of continental philosophy, and indeed all philosophy. True: because the question of meaning is a profoundly philosophical question, and philosophers have developed some of the most powerful resources for thinking about meaning. Moreover, though: the meaningful of literature is intimately bound up with the history of philosophy, and can never really be separated from it. But—-and this is very important—- literary theory is not “just” philosophy, not even just “continental philosophy,” but something else, even though the cutting edge of continental philosophy, for essential and not merely institutional reasons, tends to converge with literary theory. Literary theory goes beyond “continental philosophy,” or at least remains irreducible to it, when it thinks the “event” of singular literary texts rather than simply regarding literary texts as exemplary for philosophical truth. It demands a deep understanding of history, though not an encyclopedic knowledge of historical facts. Literature is a historical phenomenon, and can never be understood outside this horizon—- even if it is a mistake to reduce the literary text to its historical context. It demands a knowledge of the history of literature, and of art and other cultural activities. It demands knowledge of everything… There is nothing that it is not somehow related to textual and literary meaning… Not even higher mathematics, set theory, differential calculus… It demands knowledge of the “canon” of literary theory as well as the scholarly debates surrounding it. This, in fact, is already too much… اضافه کنم چون ادبیات سروکارش با انسان هاست حتما به دانش روانشناسی و رفتارشناسی انسانها هم نیازه. هم روانشناسی نوین مثلا روانشناسی اجتماعی، اقتصاد رفتاری، روانشناسی عصبی و ... و هم روانشناسی قدیمی که فلاسفه در قالب فلسفه بهش میپرداختن Consider the elements and wonder what the author meant, what types of things stood out and why. See if the words have any type of connection to any other words or meanings. Then re read the work. Jot down the ideas and put them in an order that connects them to each other when necessary. This could be done as a mind map.","completion":"توجه کنید به نقاطی که عجیب به نظر می‌رسند. کلامِ عجیب. شخصیت‌های عجیب. تکرارهای عجیب. نقاطی که نویسنده مکث می‌کند و به چیزهایی که ابتدا بی‌اهمیت به نظر می‌رسند، توجه زیادی نشان می‌دهد. خوانندگان بد که بین خطوط نمی‌خوانند یا (الف) به نقاط عجیب توجه نمی‌کنند چون مانند زامبی می‌خوانند، یا (ب) آن‌ها را می‌بینند و می‌گویند، \\"این عجیب است\\" و سپس بدون تلاش برای توضیح اینکه چرا جزئیات عجیب در آنجا ظاهر شده‌اند، به خواندن ساده خود ادامه می‌دهند. پس، اگر متوجه شدید که نویسنده شش پاراگراف صرف توصیف یک چراغ‌پست کرده است - این نشانه خوبی است که چیزی بیشتر از یک چراغ‌پست در آنجا نهفته است. شاید نمادی باشد. شاید پیش‌درآمدی باشد. شاید یک انگاره‌ی موسیقایی باشد. اگر متوجه شدید که یک شخصیت نام عجیبی دارد، مثل \\"ایملدا گودبادی\\"، یا چیزی شبیه به آن، استوار و فکر کنید به آن. اگر عجیب است که الگوی لباس، رنگ خاصی یا نوعی از لباس خاصی می‌پوشد یا همیشه گل رزی حمل می‌کند، توقف کنید و به آن فکر کنید. هر وقت چنین جزئیات عجیبی را پیدا و علامت‌گذاری کردید، مکث کنید و سعی کنید توضیح دهید که چرا فکر می‌کنید نویسنده زمان زیادی صرف تمرکز بر آن بخش کرده است. احتمالاً، این کار به شما اجازه می‌دهد که بین خطوط بخوانید. اگر بتوانید توضیحی ارائه دهید که چرا نویسنده تصمیم گرفته صفحاتی را به چراغ‌پست اختصاص دهد (آیا در اینجا نمادگرایی نور در مورد دانش در مقابل نادانی است؟)، یا چرا \\"گودبادی\\" را برای نام خانوادگی شخصیت انتخاب کرده است (آیا او پیشنهاد می‌کند که خیلی فریبنده و جذاب است؟)، یا چرا او همیشه گل رز حمل می‌کند (آیا او یک رومانتیک نومید است؟ آیا او پیش‌درآمدی را نشان می‌دهد که او با گل‌فروش از فصل دوم ملاقات خواهد کرد؟)، پس شما شروع به خواندن بین خطوط خواهید کرد - یعنی تفسیر آنچه که فراتر از سطح جریان دارد. ابزارهای زیادی برای درک معنای موضوعی وجود دارد. اولین و مهم‌ترین ابزار، حس مشترک است. با فرضیه وارد متن شوید که نویسنده قصد دارد معنایی قطعی را منتقل کند و سعی نخواهد کرد آن را پنهان کند. در بسیاری موارد، نویسنده به شما خواهد گفت. به عنوان مثال، مقدمه‌ای بر رومئو و ژولیت را می‌آورم. دو خاندان، هر دو به اقتدار یکسان، در زیبایی ورونا، که ما صحنه خود را در آن قرار می‌دهیم، از کینه‌های کهن به شورش تازه‌ای بر می‌خیزند، که خون مدنی، دستان مدنی را آلوده می‌سازد. از رحم سرنوشت‌ساز این دو دشمن زوجی عاشق ستاره‌پیشگان جان خود را می‌ستانند؛ که شکست‌های بینوایانه‌شان با مرگشان دشمنی والدین خویش را به خاک می‌سپارند. گذر وحشت‌انگیز از عشق آنان که با مرگ نشانه‌گذاری شده، و ادامه خشم والدین‌شان، که جز پایان فرزندان‌شان، هیچ نمی‌توانست آن را بردارد، اکنون ترافیک دوساعته صحنه ما شده‌است؛ که اگر با گوش‌های صبورانه به آن گوش فرا دهید، آنچه را که در اینجا فقدان دارد، کوشش ما جبران خواهد کرد. شکسپیر در اینجا دقیقاً به ما می‌گوید که نمایش درباره چه چیزی است؛ عواقب دشمنی‌های مدنی که تنها با یک تراژدی (عشق \\"علامت‌دار مرگ\\" در دو معنا، نه تنها به دنیا نمیرند بلکه به عنوان خودکشی، جان‌های آنان محکوم به دوزخ است) پایان می‌یابد. این نمایش درباره عشق واقعی نیست؛ بلکه درباره ترتیب درستی یک کشور است. چند مانع معمولی به جز اشارات و متن فکری وجود دارد. هر چقدر در زمان به عقب‌تر برویم، احتمال بیشتری وجود دارد که کلمات در معنا تغییر کنند. به عنوان مثال، کلمه \\"silly\\" در انگلیسی عصر الیزابت معمولاً به معنای \\"شایسته همدردی، ترحم، یا دلسوزی\\" یا \\"ناتوان و ضعیف\\" یا چند معنای قابل مقایسه دیگر خواهد بود، که کاملاً متفاوت از معنای کنونی است. یک فرهنگ لغت معمولی در اینجا به شما خدمت نخواهد کرد؛ اینجا جایی است که شما باید یاد بگیرید چگونه از فرهنگ لغت اکسفورد استفاده کنید، که هر کتابخانه‌ی بزرگی آن را به صورت فیزیکی یا آنلاین در دسترس خواهد داشت. این یک فرهنگ لغت بر اساس اصول تاریخی است، که معنای اولیه آن اولین معنای لیست‌شده است و با نقل قول‌های مرتبط توضیح داده شده‌اند. گاهی اوقات حتی نسخه‌های خوب تفسیر شده یک نمایش، شعر، یا رمان نیز راهنمایی در مورد دقیق معنای یک کلمه به شما ارائه نخواهند داد. مثال دیگری بسیار مهم: یک کلمه کلیدی در هملت، \\"مالیخولیا\\" است که هم توسط هملت برای توصیف خودش و هم توسط کلودیوس برای توصیف هملت استفاده شده است. معنای عصر الیزابت، یعنی شخصیتی که تحت سیطره صفرای سیاه است، یک اصطلاح پزشکی نسبتاً دقیق در نوع فهم پزشکی زمان شکسپیر است و بسیار متفاوت از معنای بسیار ملایم‌تر مدرن است. (برای جزئیات بیشتر، \\"نظریه طبعیات\\" را در گوگل جستجو کنید.) مهارت دیگر برای جستجوی الگوها در تصاویر استفاده شده توسط نویسنده، یا یک تصویر سازمان‌دهنده است. یک مثال معروف در فصل ۲۷ \\"میدل‌مارچ\\" اثر جرج الیوت (میدل‌مارچ - فصل ۲۷، اولین پاراگراف کامل) است که در آن شمع در آینه نه تنها آگاهی شخصیت را توضیح می‌دهد بلکه نحوه‌ای که نویسنده رویدادها را به روش‌های معنادار سازمان می‌دهد. حتی از آن هم غنی‌تر است. برای خلاصه کردن: - معنی در یک اثر ادبی موضوعی است و توسط نویسنده تعریف شده است. - با فرضیه وارد شوید که نویسنده، اغلب به طور مستقیم، به شما خواهد گفت که او یا او منظورش چیست. - یک اثر را با توجه به متن فکری زمان خود تجزیه و تحلیل کنید. به عنوان مثال، تفسیرهای فرویدی از شکسپیر اغلب مستقیماً با مفهوم واضح اثر در تضاد هستند. - دنبال تصاویر سازمان‌دهنده و تکرار شونده بگردید. - به معانی فردی کلمات کلیدی دقت کنید. اگر معنی یک کلمه در یک قطعه مبهم به نظر می‌رسد - اگر یادداشت‌هایی دارید، همان‌ها را بررسی کنید، یا از OED استفاده کنید. یکی از گزینه‌هایی که دوست دارم، به ویژه وقتی موضوع این است که جمله‌بندی قدیمی به قدری متفاوت از نحوه استفاده ما از کلمات اکنون است، جستجو برای یافتن یک اقتباس فیلم BCC خوب از کتاب است. گاهی اوقات دیدن عبارات در عمل معنی را شفاف‌تر می‌کند، و BCC به شدت با معانی اصلی در مقابل کنونی‌ها دقیق است. برای شکسپیر اقتباس‌هایی توسط کِنِت برانا را پیشنهاد می‌کنم. \\"کسانی که در خواندن دوباره ناکام می‌مانند، به خواندن همان داستان در همه‌جا محکوم هستند\\" - نسبت داده شده به رولاند بارت یک روش دیگر برای تجزیه و تحلیل یک اثر ادبی به سادگی خواندن دوباره آن است، و بار دوم با یک هایلایت کننده به آرامی بخوانید. المان‌هایی که تکرار می‌شوند برجسته کنید و به زبان داستان توجه کنید. من داستان \\"ریتا هیوارث و رستگاری شاوشنک\\" نوشته استیون کینگ را به این شکل دوباره خواندم تا آماده شوم تا آن را به یک کلاس درس تدریس کنم. مدت‌ها پیش این کار را بسیار انجام داده بودم، اما وقت"},{"prompt":"متن زیر را به فارسی ترجمه کن. ترجمه عالی و دقیق It’s Greek to Me IN THESE LAST THREE CHAPTERS we’ve talked about three sorts of myth: Shakespearean, biblical, and folk/fairy tale. The connection of religion and myth sometimes causes trouble in class when someone takes myth to mean “untrue” and finds it hard to unite that meaning with deeply held religious beliefs. That’s not what I mean by “myth,” though. Rather, what I’m suggesting is the shaping and sustaining power of story and symbol. Whether one believes that the story of Adam and Eve is true, literally or figuratively, matters, but not in this context. Here, in this activity of reading and understanding literature, we’re chiefly concerned with how that story functions as material for literary creators, the way in which it can inform a story or poem, and how it is perceived by the reader. All three of these mythologies work as sources of material, of correspondences, of depth for the modern writer (and every writer is modern—even John Dryden was not archaic when he was writing), and provided they’re recognizable to the reader, they enrich and enhance the reading experience. Of the three, biblical myth probably covers the greatest range of human situations, encompassing all ages of life including the next life, all relationships whether personal or governmental, and all phases of the individual’s experience, physical, sexual, psychological, spiritual. Still, both the worlds of Shakespeare and of fairy and folk tales provide fairly complete coverage as well. What we mean in speaking of “myth” in general is story, the ability of story to explain ourselves to ourselves in ways that physics, philosophy, mathematics, chemistry—all very highly useful and informative in their own right—can’t. That explanation takes the shape of stories that are deeply ingrained in our group memory, that shape our culture and are in turn shaped by it, that constitute a way of seeing by which we read the world and, ultimately, ourselves. Let’s say it this way: myth is a body of story that matters. Every community has its own body of story that matters. Nineteenth-century composer Richard Wagner went back to the Germanic myths for the material for his operas, and whether the results are good or bad in either historic or musical terms, the impulse to work with his tribal myths is completely understandable. The late twentieth century witnessed a great surge of Native American writing, much of which went back to tribal myth for material, for imagery, for theme, as in the case of Leslie Marmon Silko’s “Yellow Woman,” Louise Erdrich’s Kashpaw/Nanapush novels, and Gerald Vizenor’s peculiar Bearheart: The Heirship Chronicles. When Toni Morrison introduces human flight into Song of Solomon, many readers, white readers especially, take her to be referring to Icarus, whereas what she really has in mind, she has said, is the myth of the flying Africans, a story that matters to her community, her tribe. On one level, there’s not much difference between Silko’s project and Wagner’s; he too is simply going back to the myths of his tribe. We sometimes forget that people in an age of top hats and stiff collars had tribes, but we do so at our peril. In all these cases, what the artist is doing is reaching back for stories that matter to him and his community—for myth. In European and Euro-American cultures, of course, there’s another source of myth. Let me rephrase that: MYTH. When most of us think “myth,” we mean the northern shores of the Mediterranean between two and three thousand years ago. We mean Greece and Rome. Greek and Roman myth is so much a part of the fabric of our consciousness, of our unconscious really, that we scarcely notice. You doubt me? In the town where I live, the college teams are known as the Spartans. Our high school? The Trojans. In my state we have a Troy (one of whose high schools is Athens—and they say there are no comedians in education), an Ithaca, a Sparta, a Romulus, a Remus, and a Rome. These communities are scattered around the state and date from different periods of settlement. Now if a town in the center of Michigan, a fair distance from anything that can be called Aegean or Ionian (although it’s not very far from the town of Ionia), can be named Ithaca, it suggests that Greek myth has had pretty good staying power. Let’s go back to Toni Morrison for a moment. I’m always slightly amazed that Icarus gets all the ink. It was his father, Daedalus, who crafted the wings, who knew how to get off Crete and safely reach the mainland, and who in fact flew to safety. Icarus, the kid, the daredevil, failed to follow his father’s advice and plunged to his death. His fall remains a source of enduring fascination for us and for our literature and art. In it we see so much: the parental attempt to save the child and the grief at having failed, the cure that proves as deadly as the ailment, the youthful exuberance that leads to self destruction, the clash between sober, adult wisdom and adolescent recklessness, and of course the terror involved in that headlong descent into the sea. Absolutely none of this has anything to do with Morrison and her flying Africans, so it’s little wonder that she’s a bit mystified by this response of her readers. But it’s a story and a pattern that is so deeply burrowed into our consciousness that readers may almost automatically consider it whenever flying or falling is invoked. Clearly it doesn’t fit the situation in Song of Solomon. But it does apply in other works. In 1558 Pieter Brueghel painted a wonderful picture, Landscape with Fall of Icarus. In the foreground we see a plowman and his ox, just beyond him a shepherd and his flock, and at sea a merchant ship sailing placidly along; this is a scene of utter ordinariness and tranquillity. Only in the lower right corner of the painting is there anything even remotely suggestive of trouble: a pair of legs askew as they disappear into the water. That’s our boy. He really doesn’t have much of a presence in the frame, but his presence makes all the difference. Without the pathos of the doomed boy, we have a picture of farming and merchant shipping with no narrative or thematic power. I teach, with some regularity, two great poems based on that painting, W. H. Auden’s “Musée des Beaux Arts” (1940) and William Carlos Williams’s “Landscape with Fall of Icarus” (1962). They’re wonderful poems, very different from each other in tone, style, and form, but in essential agreement about how the world goes on even in the face of our private tragedies. Each artist alters what he finds in the painting. Brueghel introduces the plowman and the ship, neither of which appears in the version that comes to us from the Greeks. And Williams and Auden find, in their turn, slightly different elements to emphasize in the painting. Williams’s poem stresses the pictorial elements of the painting, trying to capture the scene while sneaking in the thematic elements. Even his arrangement of the poem on the page, narrow and highly vertical, recalls the body plummeting from the sky. Auden’s poem, on the other hand, is a meditation on the private nature of suffering and the way in which the larger world takes no interest in our private disasters. It is astonishing and pleasing to discover that the painting can occasion these two very different responses. Beyond them, readers find their own messages in all this. As someone who was a teenager in the sixties, I am reminded by the fate of Icarus of all those kids who bought muscle cars with names like Mustang and Firebird and Charger and Barracuda. All the driver education and solid parental advice in the world can’t overcome the allure of that kind of power, and sadly, in too many cases those young drivers shared the fate of Icarus. My students, somewhat younger than I am, will inevitably draw other parallels. Still, it all goes back to the myth: the boy, the wings, the unscheduled dive. So that’s one way classical myth can work: overt subject matter for poems and paintings and operas and novels. What else can myth do? Here’s a thought. Let’s say you wanted to write an epic poem about a community of poor fishermen in the Caribbean. If this was a place you came from, and you knew these people like you know your own family, you’d want to depict the jealousies and resentments and adventure and danger, as well as capturing their dignity and their life in a way that conveys all that has escaped the notice of tourists and white property owners. You could, I suppose, try being really, really earnest, portraying the characters as very serious and sober, making them noble by virtue of their goodness. But I bet that wouldn’t work. What you’d wind up with instead would probably be very stiff and artificial, and artificiality is never noble. Besides, these folks aren’t saints. They make a lot of mistakes: they’re petty, envious, lustful, occasionally greedy as well as courageous, elegant, powerful, knowledgeable, profound. And you want noble, after all, not Tonto—there’s no Lone Ranger here. Alternatively, you might try grafting their story onto some older story of rivalry and violence, a story where even the victor is ultimately doomed, a story where, despite occasional personal shortcomings, the characters have an unmistakable nobility. You could give your characters names like Helen, Philoctetes, Hector, and Achille. At least that’s what Nobel Prize winner Derek Walcott does in his Omeros (1990). Those names are drawn, of course, from The Iliad, although Walcott uses elements—parallels, persons, and situations—of both it and The Odyssey in his epic. The question we will inevitably ask is, Why? Why should someone in the late twentieth century draw on a story that was passed along orally from the twelfth through the eighth century b.c. and not written down until maybe two or three hundred years later? Why should someone try to compare modern fishermen with these legendary heroes, many of whom were descended from gods? Well for starters, Homer’s legendary heroes were farmers and fishermen. Besides, aren’t we all descended from gods? Walcott reminds us by this parallel of the potential for greatness that resides in all of us, no matter how humble our worldly circumstances. That’s one answer. The other is that the situations match up more closely than we might expect. The plot of The Iliad is not particularly divine or global. Those who have never read it assume mistakenly that it is the story of the Trojan War. It is not. It is the story of a single, rather lengthy action: the wrath of Achilles (a mere fifty-three days out of ten years). Achilles becomes angry with his leader, Agamemnon, withdraws his support from the Greeks, only rejoining the battle when the consequences of his action have destroyed his best friend, Patroclus. At this point he turns his wrath against the Trojans and in particular their greatest hero, Hector, whom he eventually kills. His reason for such anger? Agamemnon has taken his war prize. Trivial? It gets worse. The prize is a woman. Agamemnon, forced by divine order and by public sentiment to return his concubine to her father, retaliates against the person who most publicly sided against him, Achilles, by taking his concubine, Briseis. Is that petty enough? Is that noble? No Helen, no judgment of Paris, no Trojan horse. At its core, it’s the story of a man who goes berserk because his stolen war bride is confiscated, acted out against a background of wholesale slaughter, the whole of which is taking place because another man, Menelaus (brother of Agamemnon) has had his wife stolen by Paris, half brother of Hector. That’s how Hector winds up having to carry the hopes for salvation of all Troy on his shoulders. And yet somehow, through the centuries, this story dominated by the theft of two women has come to epitomize ideals of heroism and loyalty, sacrifice and loss. Hector is more stubbornly heroic in his doomed enterprise than anyone you’ve ever seen. Achilles’ grief at the loss of his beloved friend is truly heartbreaking. The big duels—between Hector and Ajax, between Diomedes and Paris, between Hector and Patroclus, between Hector and Achilles—are genuinely exciting and suspenseful, their outcomes sources of grand celebration and dismay. No wonder so many modern writers have often borrowed from and emulated Homer. And when did that begin? Almost immediately. Virgil, who died in 19 b.c., patterned his Aeneas on the Homeric heroes. If Achilles did it or Odysseus went there, so does Aeneas. Why? It’s what heroes do. Aeneas goes to the underworld. Why? Odysseus went there. He kills a giant from the enemy camp in a final climactic battle. Why? Achilles did. And so on. The whole thing is less derivative than it sounds and not without humor and irony. Aeneas and his followers are survivors of Troy, so here we have this Trojan hero acting out the patterns set down by his enemies. Moreover, when these Trojans sail past Ithaca, home to Odysseus, they jeer and curse the agent of their destruction. On the whole, though, Virgil has him undertake these actions because Homer had already defined what it means to be a hero. Back to Walcott. Almost exactly two thousand years after Virgil, Walcott has his heroes perform actions that we can recognize as symbolic reenactments of those in Homer. Sometimes it’s a bit of a stretch, since we can’t have a lot of battlefield duels out in the fishing boats. Nor can he call his Helen “the face that launched a thousand dinghies.” Lacks grandeur, that phrase. What he can do, though, is place them in situations where their nobility and their courage are put to the test, while reminding us that they are acting out some of the most basic, most primal patterns known to humans, exactly as Homer did all those centuries before. The need to protect one’s family: Hector. The need to maintain one’s dignity: Achilles. The determination to remain faithful and to have faith: Penelope. The struggle to return home: Odysseus. Homer gives us four great struggles of the human being: with nature, with the divine, with other humans, and with ourselves. What is there, after all, against which we need to prove ourselves but those four things? In our modern world, of course, parallels may be ironized, that is, turned on their head for purposes of irony. How many of us would see the comedy of three escaped convicts as parallel to the wanderings of Odysseus? Still, that’s what brothers Joel and Ethan Coen give us in their 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? It’s about trying to get home, isn’t it? Or this, the most famous example: a single day in Dublin in 1904, on which a young man decides on his future and an older man wanders the city, eventually returning home to his wife in the small hours of the next morning. The book has only one overt clue that this all might have something to do with Homer, its one-word title: Ulysses (1922). As we now know, James Joyce envisioned every one of the eighteen episodes of the novel as a parallel to some incident or situation in The Odyssey. There’s an episode in a newspaper office, for instance, which parallels Odysseus’s visit to Aeolus, the god of the winds, but the parallel may seem pretty tenuous. To be sure, newspapermen are a windy group and there are a lot of rhetorical flourishes in the episode, to say nothing of the fact that a gust of wind does zip through at one point. Still, we can see it as resembling the Homeric original only if we understand that resemblance in terms of a funhouse mirror, full of distortion and goofy correspondences—if we understand it, in other words, as an ironic parallel. The fact that it’s ironic makes the parallel—and the Aeolus episode—such fun. Joyce is less interested than Walcott in investing his characters with classical nobility, although finally they do take on something of that quality. After watching poor old Leopold Bloom stroll around Dublin all day and half the night, running into no end of trouble and recalling great heartbreak in his life, we may well come to feel he is noble in his own way. His nobility, however, is not that of Odysseus. Greek and Roman myth, of course, is more than Homer. The transformations of Ovid’s Metamorphoses show up in all sorts of later works, not least in Franz Kafka’s story of a man who wakes up one morning to find he’s changed into an enormous beetle. He called it “The Metamorphosis.” Indiana Jones may look like pure Hollywood, but the intrepid searcher after fabulous treasure goes back to Apollonius and The Argonautica, the story of Jason and the Argonauts. Something a bit homier? Sophocles’ plays of Oedipus and his doomed clan show up over and over again in all sorts of variations. There is, in fact, no form of dysfunctional family or no personal disintegration of character for which there is not a Greek or Roman model. Not for nothing do the names of Greek tragic characters figure in Freud’s theories. The wronged woman gone violent in her grief and madness? Would you like Aeneas and Dido or Jason and Medea? And as in every good early religion, they had an explanation for natural phenomena, from the change of seasons (Demeter and Persephone and Hades) to why the nightingale sounds the way it does (Philomena and Tereus). Happily for us, most of it got written down, often in several versions, so that we have access to this wonderful body of story. And because writers and readers share knowledge of a big portion of this body of story, this mythology, when writers use it, we readers recognize it, sometimes to its full extent, sometimes only dimly or only because we know the Looney Tunes version. That recognition makes our experience of literature richer, deeper, more meaningful, so that our own modern stories also matter, also share in the power of myth. Among the more interesting recent developments in writing for younger readers is the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series by Rick Riordan. The quintet of novels begins with The Lightning Thief (2005). Percy is a misfit kid who finds out he’s the son of Poseidon and is accused of stealing Zeus’s weapon of choice, the lightning bolt. Then he finds out his pal is a satyr, fights a minotaur, and befriends a daughter of Athena, and all Hades breaks loose. As a demigod, Percy has issues with normality (things like ADHD and dyslexia), but he’s the real deal on the hero front, as he gets a chance to prove over and over. His divine bloodlines help, as do his mythic buddies. It’s one thing, you know, to be the offspring of a former star pupil at your wizarding prep school, but to have the sea god as your dad, well . . . Oh, did I forget to say? That title of Walcott’s, Omeros? In the local dialect, it means Homer. Naturally. 9","completion":"این به زبان یونانی است. در این سه فصل آخر درباره سه نوع افسانه صحبت کردیم: شکسپیر، کتاب مقدس و قصه‌های عامیانه/پریان. ارتباط دین و افسانه گاهی اوقات در کلاس مشکل ایجاد می‌کند زمانی که کسی افسانه را به معنای \\"نادرست\\" می‌گیرد و یافتن اتحاد آن معنا با اعتقادات مذهبی عمیق را سخت می‌یابد. اما منظور من از \\"افسانه\\" این نیست. به جای آن، من به قدرت شکل‌دهی و حیات‌بخش داستان و نماد اشاره می‌کنم. اینکه کسی باور دارد داستان آدم و حوا حقیقت دارد، به صورت حرفی یا مجازی، موضوع مهمی است، اما نه در این بستر. اینجا، در این فعالیت خواندن و درک ادبیات، ما به طور عمده با نحوه عملکرد آن داستان به عنوان ماده برای خالقان ادبی، راه‌هایی که می‌تواند یک داستان یا شعر را آگاه کند و نحوه درک خواننده مشغولیم. هر سه این افسانه‌ها به عنوان منبع مواد، موارد مربوط و عمق برای نویسنده مدرن (و هر نویسنده‌ای مدرن است - حتی جان درایدن وقتی می‌نوشت قدیمی نبود) عمل می‌کنند و مادامی که برای خواننده قابل تشخیص باشند، تجربه خواندن را غنی و بهبود می‌بخشند. از میان سه تا، افسانه کتاب مقدس احتمالا بیشترین دامنه موقعیت‌های انسانی را پوشش می‌دهد، شامل تمام دوره‌های زندگی از جمله زندگی بعدی، تمام روابط چه شخصی و چه دولتی، و تمام مراحل تجربه فردی، جسمی، جنسی، روانشناختی، معنوی. با این وجود، هم دنیاهای شکسپیر و هم داستان‌های پریان و عامیانه نیز پوشش نسبتا کاملی دارند. منظور ما از \\"افسانه\\" به صورت کلی داستان است، توانایی داستان برای توضیح خودمان به خودمان به روش‌هایی که فیزیک، فلسفه، ریاضیات، شیمی - همه بسیار کاربردی و آموزنده در حق خود - نمی‌توانند. این توضیح به شکل داستان‌هایی است که عمیقاً در حافظه گروهی‌مان ریشه دارند، شکل می‌دهند فرهنگمان را و به نوبه خود توسط آن شکل می‌گیرند، که یک روش دیدن تشکیل می‌دهند که به واسطه‌ آن جهان و در نهایت خودمان را می‌خوانیم. بیایید اینطور بگوییم: افسانه مجموعه‌ای از داستان‌هایی است که اهمیت دارند. هر اجتماعی مجموعه خاص خود از داستان‌های مهم را دارد. آهنگساز قرن نوزدهم ریچارد واگنر برای مواد اپراهایش به افسانه‌های ژرمنی بازگشت، و چه نتایجی از نظر تاریخی یا موسیقیایی خوب یا بد باشند، انگیزه کار با افسانه‌های قبیله‌ای خود کاملاً قابل درک است. در اواخر قرن بیستم شاهد موج بزرگی از نوشتار بومی آمریکایی بودیم که بسیاری از آن‌ها برای مواد، برای تصویرسازی، برای موضوع، به افسانه‌های قبیله‌ای بازگشتند، مانند مورد \\"زن زرد\\" نوشته لسلی مارمون سیلکو، رمان‌های کاشپاو/ناناپوش نوشته لوئیس اردریچ و \\"بِرهارت: میراث کرونیکلز\\" عجیب نوشته جرالد ویزنر. وقتی تونی موریسون پرواز انسانی را وارد \\"سرود سلیمان\\" می‌کند، بسیاری از خوانندگان، به‌ویژه خوانندگان سفیدپوست، وی را به اشاره به ایکاروس می‌گیرند، در حالی که آنچه واقعاً در ذهن دارد، او گفته است، افسانه آفریقایی‌های پرنده است، داستانی که برای اجتماع و قبیله‌اش مهم است. در یک سطح، تفاوت زیادی بین پروژه سیلکو و واگنر وجود ندارد؛ او نیز فقط به افسانه‌های قبیله خود باز می‌گردد. ما گاهی فراموش می‌کنیم که مردم در عصر کلاه‌های ارتفاعی و یقه‌های سفت قبیله داشتند، اما اگر این کار را کنیم به خطر خواهیم افتاد. در تمام این موارد، کاری که هنرمند انجام می‌دهد، بازگشت به داستان‌هایی است که برای او و جامعه‌اش اهمیت دارد - به افسانه. البته، در فرهنگ‌های اروپایی و اروپایی-آمریکایی، منبع دیگری از افسانه وجود دارد. بگذارید این‌گونه بازنویسی کنم: افسانه. وقتی بیشتر ما به \\"افسانه\\" فکر می‌کنیم، ما به سواحل شمالی مدیترانه بین دو و سه هزار سال پیش اشاره می‌کنیم. ما منظورمان یونان و روم است. افسانه یونانی و رومی به قدری بخشی از پارچه آگاهی ما، واقعاً ناخودآگاه ما است که ما به ندرت توجه می‌کنیم. به من شک دارید؟ در شهری که من زندگی می‌کنم، تیم‌های کالج به نام اسپارتان‌ها شناخته می‌شوند. دبیرستان ما؟ اهل تروا. در ایالت من ما یک تروا (یکی از دبیرستان‌های ارشد آن اتنا است - و می‌گویند در آموزش و پرورش هیچ کمدینی نیست)، یک ایتاکا، یک اسپارتا، یک رومولوس، یک راموس و یک روم داریم. این جوامع در سراسر ایالت پراکنده شده و از دوره‌های مختلف استقرار نشأت گرفته‌اند. حالا اگر شهری در مرکز میشیگان، که تا حدی از هر چیزی که می‌تواند دریای اژه یا یونانی خوانده شود فاصله دارد (گرچه خیلی دور از شهر ایونیا نیست)، نام ایتاکا را بگیرد، این نشان می‌دهد که افسانه یونانی قدرت ماندگاری بسیار خوبی داشته است. بیایید یک لحظه به تونی موریسون بازگردیم. من همیشه کمی حیرت‌زده‌ام که ایکاروس همه جوهر را به خود اختصاص می‌دهد. پدرش، ددالوس بود که بال‌ها را ساخت، که می‌دانست چگونه از کرت خلاص شود و به سلامت به خشکی برسد و در واقع به امنیت پرواز کرد. ایکاروس، بچه، جوان جسور، به توصیه پدرش گوش نداد و به مرگ خود پرت شد. سقوط او منبع توجه دائمی ما و ادبیات و هنر ما است. در آن ما چیزهای زیادی می‌بینیم: تلاش والدین برای نجات فرزند و غم و اندوه در شکست، درمانی که به همان اندازه کشنده بیماری است، جوانی پر شور که منجر به خودکشی می‌شود، تقابل بین خرد بالغان و بی‌پروایی نوجوانان، و البته وحشتی که در سقوط آزاد به دریا وجود دارد. کاملاً هیچ یک از این‌ها هیچ ارتباطی به موریسون و آفریقایی‌های پرواز کننده ندارند، بنابراین کمی عجیب نیست که او از این پاسخ خوانندگانش کمی حیران شده است. اما این داستان و الگویی است که به طور عمیق در آگاهی ما فرو رفته است که خوانندگان ممکن است تقریباً به صورت خودکار آن‌را مورد توجه قرار دهند هرگاه پرواز یا سقوط مطرح می‌شود. واضح است که این مورد مناسب \\"سرود سلیمان\\" نیست. اما در آثار دیگر کاربرد دارد. در سال 1558 پیتر بروگل نقاشی زیبایی برداشت، \\"چشم‌انداز با سقوط ایکاروس\\". در پیش‌زمینه ما یک کشاورز و گاو او را می‌بینیم، کمی آن‌طرف‌تر یک چوپان و گله‌اش، و در دریا یک کشتی بازرگانی به آرامی در حال حرکت است؛ این صحنه‌ای است از عادت مطلق و آرامش. تنها در گوشه پایین راست نقاشی چیزی حتی به دور از اشاره به دردسر وجود دارد: یک جفت پا مختل شده در حال ناپدید شدن به درون آب. این پسر ماست. واقعا در قاب تصویر حضور زیادی ندارد، اما حضورش همه چیز را تغییر می‌دهد. بدون غم‌انگیزی پسر محکوم، ما تصویری از کشاورزی و کشتیرانی بازرگانی داریم بدون قدرت روایی یا موضوعی. من با برخی انتظام، دو شعر عالی را بر اساس آن نقاشی تدریس می‌کنم، \\"موزه هنرهای زیبا\\" نوشته W. H. Auden (1940) و \\"چشم‌انداز با سقوط ایکاروس\\" نوشته ویلیام کارلوس ویلیامز (1962). این‌ها شعرهای شگفت‌انگیزی هستند، بسیار متفاوت از یکدیگر در لحن، سبک و شکل، اما در توافق اساسی در مورد نحوه ادامه دنیا حتی در برابر تراژدی‌های خصوصی ما. هر هنرمند آنچه را در نقاشی"},{"prompt":"let review this contract foe finding existence vulnerability in the code and bug present in the contract with explanation here is the contract review line by line // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

The smart contract aims to provide a guard mechanism for a Gnosis Safe community multisig (CM), which acts as a filter for transactions that are approved by the Gnosis Safe. It allows the owner to manage which transactions are authorized based on the target contract, the function being called (selector), and the chain ID. Here's an analysis of key areas and any potential issues: 1. **Contract Version and Style** - The contract uses Solidity version 0.8.23, which is a fairly recent version with built-in overflow checks. - Code style follows best practices for readability, with comments and NatSpec documentation. 2. **Access Controls** - The contract has an \`owner\` and a \`multisig\` account that have different levels of control over the contract. The contract employs strong ownership checks before allowing changes to the contract state. - Revert error messages like \`OwnerOnly\` and \`ManagerOnly\` are used to provide detailed feedback on failed transactions due to permission issues. 3. **Pausability** - The contract includes a pause mechanism that, when activated, allows all transactions to pass through without checks. The \`paused\` variable is used to control this, meaning external factors can freeze the guardian logic if necessary. 4. **Code Logic** - Contract functions such as \`_verifySchedule()\`, \`_verifyData()\`, \`_verifyBridgedData()\`, and \`_processBridgeData()\` carry out the main logic of validating the transactions. These functions are composed together correctly to create a validation chain. - The \`_verifyData()\` and \`_verifyBridgedData()\` functions use bitwise operations to construct a unique key for validation which is a common practice for optimizing gas in mappings. 5. **Error Reporting** - Custom errors such as \`ZeroAddress\`, \`ZeroValue\`, \`WrongArrayLength\` are provided which is better for gas optimization compared to using \`require\` statements with strings for revert reasons. 6. **Modularity and Code Reuse** - The contract appears to be bespoke for its application, and does not exhibit overt modularity or code re-use characteristics. It is tailored for the expected interactions with the Gnosis Safe multisig and governance structure. 7. **Gas Efficiency** - The use of bitwise operations for constructing keys, and checks on function selectors, contributes to gas efficiency. - The contract uses loops in some validation functions; however, they depend on input array sizes. If the arrays are too large, out-of-gas errors might occur. 8. **Vulnerabilities and Security Concerns** - No obvious security vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows, or improper access controls were found upon static review of the contract. However, more thorough dynamic testing, such as fuzzing or formal verification, is recommended. - Guards against invalid transactions are based on the correct setup of the mapping for allowed function selectors; a misconfiguration could lead to unauthorized transactions being approved. 9. **External Calls and Interactions** - The contract interacts with external contracts through interface \`IGovernor\` and implies interacting with Gnosis Safe contracts. Proper validation before these interactions is crucial to avoid issues like phishing attacks or unexpected results from external contract changes. 10. **Code Optimization Suggestions** - Usage of unchecked blocks might be considered if there are explicit checks before arithmetic operations to save gas from overflow checks (though caution is advised). - Some loops could be optimized by caching array lengths in memory if gas efficiency becomes a concern during execution. 11. **Miscellaneous** - The contract uses constants and immutable variables where possible, which is a good practice to save gas. - There are no apparent fallback or receive functions defined, meaning the contract is not meant to handle direct Ether transactions which align with its use case. Lastly, the quality of the code suggests the authors are experienced and conscious of security practices. Nonetheless, this review is not exhaustive and the contract should undergo thorough evaluations including unit testing, integration testing, and potentially a formal audit, to ensure its security and correctness in a real-world deployment scenario."},{"prompt":"no review the contract and focus on the main components and their interactions. What would you say are the key functions or modules in this contract that we should highlight in our diagram?","completion":"To create a high-level diagram of the contract, it's important to highlight the main components and their interactions. Below are the key functions/modules that stand out within the \`GuardCM\` contract: 1. **Access Control & Ownership** - \`owner\`: Immutable variable representing the owner (presumably a Timelock contract). - \`multisig\`: Immutable variable representing the multisig address. - \`changeGovernor()\`: Allows the owner to change the governor address. - \`pause()\`, \`unpause()\`: Functions to pause or unpause the guard, affecting its operational state. 2. **Governance** - \`governor\`: Variable holding the address of the governor contract. - \`changeGovernorCheckProposalId()\`: Changes the internal proposal check ID relating to the governance mechanism. 3. **Transaction Verification** - \`checkTransaction()\`: The primary entry point for the Gnosis Safe to check a transaction before execution. This method uses other internal functions (\`_verifyData()\`, \`_verifySchedule()\`, \`_verifyBridgedData()\` and \`_processBridgeData()\`) for verification. 4. **Scheduling Validation** - \`SCHEDULE\`, \`SCHEDULE_BATCH\`: Constants representing function selectors for scheduling functions. - \`_verifySchedule()\`: Validates the specified target and selector in a scheduled transaction. 5. **Bridge Data Verification** - \`setBridgeMediatorChainIds()\`: Sets up the bridge mediator contracts and chain IDs. This is key for cross-chain interactions. - \`_processBridgeData()\`: Handles cross-chain message verification and deconstructs the message format expected from various bridge implementations. 6. **Authorization Management** - \`mapAllowedTargetSelectorChainIds\`: A mapping used to store the authorization status of (target address | selector | chain ID) tuples. - \`mapBridgeMediatorL1L2ChainIds\`: A mapping linking bridge mediator addresses between Layer 1 and Layer 2. - \`setTargetSelectorChainIds()\`: Allows the owner to authorize or deauthorize specific (target, selector, chain ID) combinations. 7. **Guard Management** - \`paused\`: Stores the guard's paused state which determines whether the guard's restrictions are in place or not. - \`GuardPaused\`, \`GuardUnpaused\`: Events related to changing the paused state of the guard. 8. **Guard Interface Checks** - \`checkAfterExecution()\`: Included for interface compatibility with Gnosis Safe guards but contains no functionality. 9. **Data Validation Utilities** - \`_verifyData()\`: Verifies the combination of a target address and data payload against authorized selectors and chain IDs. - \`_verifyBridgedData()\`: Validates data bridged from other chains, using bridge mediator information and chain IDs. 10. **Error Handling** - Custom error definitions: Define conditions for various invalid states the contract may encounter (e.g., \`ZeroAddress\`, \`OwnerOnly\`, \`IncorrectDataLength\`), which are used throughout the code for clear and efficient error handling. Focus on representing the interactions between these components, the data flow, and how they contribute to the overall contract's purpose of guarding and validating transactions from a Gnosis Safe multisig address. This will ensure a comprehensive and informative diagram."},{"prompt":"review the contract again expand on the governance and transaction verification processes. How do the changeGovernorCheckProposalId and checkTransaction functions interact with other components?","completion":"Let's break down the governance and transaction verification processes, focusing on how the \`changeGovernorCheckProposalId\` and \`checkTransaction\` functions interact with other components of the contract: # Governance Process The governance process within the \`GuardCM\` contract interacts mainly with external governor contracts and the internal state of the GuardCM contract to ensure that only specific types of governance activities can occur. 1. **Governor Contract Interaction**: - The contract assumes an external governor contract (referenced by the \`governor\` variable), which manages proposals, their IDs, and their states. The \`IGovernor\` interface is used to interact with the governor contract for checking the state of a proposal. 2. **changeGovernorCheckProposalId Function**: - **Purpose**: The \`changeGovernorCheckProposalId\` function allows the owner to change the internal \`governorCheckProposalId\` variable, which stores the ID of a particular governance proposal. - **Interaction**: When the multisig wishes to pause the guard, this proposal ID is used by the \`pause()\` function to check with the governor if the proposal is in a \`Defeated\` state, indicating governance inactivity. This check serves as a condition for allowing the multisig to pause the guard. # Transaction Verification Process The transaction verification process is essential to the security of the contract and is designed to restrict unauthorized transactions. This process relies heavily on the contract's internal mappings and state, as well as configured rules for allowed transactions. 1. **checkTransaction Function**: - **Purpose**: The \`checkTransaction\` function acts as the main gatekeeper for Gnosis Safe transactions, checking them against various authorization criteria based on the destination address, data payload, and operation type. It is designed to be called before the Gnosis Safe executes a transaction. - **Operation Check**: It ensures that there is no delegate call to the owner (the Timelock address) and that no transaction is calling the multisig itself. - **Data Length Check**: The function checks that the data length is adequate for extracting a function selector and additional validation as required. - **Scheduling Function Check**: If the transaction aims to call the \`schedule\` or \`scheduleBatch\` functions owned by the Timelock address, it goes through further validation where the target, selector, and other parameters of the scheduled transaction are verified. - **Bridged Data Check**: If the target is a bridge mediator, the contract processes and verifies the bridged data using \`_processBridgeData\`. 2. **Helper Functions for Verification**: - **_verifyData**: This function uses the \`mapAllowedTargetSelectorChainIds\` mapping to confirm if the target and selector extracted from transaction data are authorized. - **_verifyBridgedData**: When transaction data represents a cross-chain message, this function verifies if the transaction is allowed based on the sender, the payload, and the linked L2 chain Id using the \`mapBridgeMediatorL1L2ChainIds\` mapping. - **_processBridgeData**: This function handles data from different bridge protocols, such as the ones for the Gnosis and Polygon chains. It processes specific data structures and checks that the bridge mediators correspond to what has been authorized. # Summary of Interactions - The \`changeGovernorCheckProposalId\` function alters the state variable related to governance checks. It essentially sets a reference point for multisig operations related to the governance activity check. - The \`checkTransaction\` function interacts with the mappings containing the validation rules and the external governor contract to verify transactions and possibly pause the contract. - Together, these functions interact with the mappings \`mapAllowedTargetSelectorChainIds\` and \`mapBridgeMediatorL1L2ChainIds\`, ensuring transaction compliance with predefined rules and the contract's paused state. The diagram for this contract would emphasize these governance and validation mechanisms, showing how they control the flow of transactions and under what conditions the guard's restrictions can be altered."},{"prompt":"reveiw again the contract and move on to the scheduling validation and bridge data verification processes. Can you explain how the SCHEDULE, SCHEDULE_BATCH, _verifySchedule, setBridgeMediatorChainIds, and _processBridgeData functions work together?","completion":"Certainly, let's delve into the Scheduling Validation and Bridge Data Verification processes of the contract and explore how the related components work together. # Scheduling Validation Process 1. **SCHEDULE and SCHEDULE_BATCH Constants**: - These constants represent the function selectors for two specific functions, presumably related to a Timelock-like functionality that schedules transactions for future execution. - \`SCHEDULE\` is likely linked to a function that schedules a single transaction. - \`SCHEDULE_BATCH\` appears to correspond to a function that schedules multiple transactions in a batch. 2. **_verifySchedule Function**: - **Purpose**: Used internally within \`checkTransaction\` to validate that any call to the Timelock's \`schedule\` or \`scheduleBatch\` functions contains authorized data. - **Operation**: This function takes the transaction data payload and the associated function selector to extract the particular transaction(s) to be scheduled. It then uses the extracted target address(es) and the data payload(s) for each scheduled transaction to perform further checks. - **Data Extraction**: For each scheduled transaction, the function confirms that any bridge-related transactions are properly formatted and vetted through \`_processBridgeData\`, and regular transactions are checked through \`_verifyData\`. # Bridge Data Verification Process 1. **setBridgeMediatorChainIds Function**: - **Purpose**: Allows the owner to map L1 bridge mediator contract addresses to corresponding L2 bridge mediators and L2 chain identifiers. This helps the contract recognize approved cross-chain bridges. - **Interaction**: Updates the \`mapBridgeMediatorL1L2ChainIds\` mapping that is used in the validation of cross-chain messages. 2. **_processBridgeData Function**: - **Purpose**: Handles the verification of data that has been bridged from another blockchain through known bridge mediators. It is tailored for specific bridge implementations on Gnosis Chain and Polygon Networks. - **Bridge Recognition**: This function first checks if the data payload begins with known function selectors related to the bridging process, such as those of the \`REQUIRE_TO_PASS_MESSAGE\` or \`SEND_MESSAGE_TO_CHILD\` functions. - **Selectors Verification**: After confirming the function selectors, the function ensures that the transaction comes from the expected L2 bridge mediator. - **Data Decoding**: The function decodes the bridged data payloads according to the data structures used by the specific bridges. - **Data Examination**: The decoded message is received and then checked for proper authorization by calling \`_verifyBridgedData\`, which loops through the message to verify each component with \`_verifyData\`. # How They Work Together: - The \`checkTransaction\` function is the main gateway through which Scheduling Validation and Bridge Data Verification are triggered. When a transaction intended for execution appears to be a scheduling transaction, it's handed off to \`_verifySchedule\`. - Within \`_verifySchedule\`, if a scheduled transaction's target is detected to be a bridge mediator, its data is scrutinized by \`_processBridgeData\`. - The \`_processBridgeData\` function uses the \`mapBridgeMediatorL1L2ChainIds\` mapping, which is populated by the \`setBridgeMediatorChainIds\` function, to validate that the bridged transaction targets are correct, and the bridged data's structure and origin are authenticated and match what's been configured by the owner. - If the bridge verification is successful and the data structure matches the expectations, \`_verifyBridgedData\` will check the contents of the message, looping over any included transactions to ensure each is authorized, based on the assembled rules around targets and selectors. Together, the Scheduling Validation and Bridge Data Verification form a comprehensive check system that only allows predefined, authorized transactions from specific sources to be scheduled or processed, whether those transactions originate on the same chain or are brought over from an L2 via bridged messaging. The configuration of bridge mediators and the registration of allowed transaction types are crucial to the guard's effective operation in protecting the multisig's assets."},{"prompt":"now review the contract again and move on to the authorization management and guard management components. How do the setTargetSelectorChainIds, pause, and unpause functions interact with the mappings and the guard's state?","completion":"Sure, let's discuss the authorization management and guard management aspects of the \`GuardCM\` smart contract. # Authorization Management 1. **setTargetSelectorChainIds Function**: - **Purpose**: Allows the owner to authorize or deauthorize combinations of target contracts, function selectors (methods), and chain IDs. This function essentially dictates which transactions the guard will consider valid. - **Interaction with Mappings**: It interacts with the \`mapAllowedTargetSelectorChainIds\` mapping, which stores whether a given (target, selector, chain ID) tuple is allowed or not. When called, the function updates this mapping based on the provided inputs. - **Data Structure**: The target address, selector, and chain ID are combined into a single \`uint256\` key (using bitwise operations) for efficient storage and lookup in the mapping. - **Multiple Updates**: Batch updates are supported, allowing the contract owner to simultaneously authorize or deauthorize multiple combinations in a single transaction, for gas efficiency. # Guard Management 2. **pause Function**: - **Purpose**: This function can be triggered by the owner (\`owner\`) or the community multisig address (\`multisig\`). Its purpose is to pause the guard's functionality, essentially disabling its checks and allowing Gnosis Safe transactions to proceed unguarded. - **Pausability Conditions**: - If called by the owner, pausing takes effect immediately. - If called by the multisig, pausing is conditional: It checks the state of a specified governance proposal (\`governorCheckProposalId\`) via the governor interface (\`IGovernor\`). Only if that proposal is in a \`Defeated\` state can the multisig pause the guard. - **Interaction with State**: On success, the function sets the \`paused\` variable to \`2\`, signaling that the guard has been paused. This state change is crucial because it switches off the guard's verification checks in \`checkTransaction\`. 3. **unpause Function**: - **Purpose**: Only the owner can call this function to unpause the guard, restoring its transaction validation functionality. - **Interaction with State**: It simply sets the \`paused\` state back to \`1\`, reenabling transaction verification checks in \`checkTransaction\`. # How These Components Interact - The \`setTargetSelectorChainIds\` function is key to configuring which transactions are allowed. Modifications to the \`mapAllowedTargetSelectorChainIds\` mapping directly influence the behavior of the \`checkTransaction\` function, which verifies whether a given transaction is authorized based on the mappings. - The \`pause\` function is an override switch for the whole guard system. When the \`paused\` state is \`2\`, the \`checkTransaction\` function will allow all transactions, bypassing its usual verification logic. This means even if \`setTargetSelectorChainIds\` has disallowed certain transactions, they would still be permitted when the guard is paused. - The \`unpause\` function serves as a way to reactivate transaction checks after the guard has been paused, effectively returning the guard to its active state, honoring the authorization configurations set by \`setTargetSelectorChainIds\` once again. - The pause mechanism also has a crucial safety feature for governance. By allowing the multisig to pause the guard based on the state of a governance proposal (checked via an external governor contract), it ensures that if governance becomes inactive or unresponsive, the multisig retains the ability to regain control and secure the guarded system. In summary, authorization management configures what is permissible, guard management can override these configurations in case of emergencies or governance issues, and the interactions between these components determine the active state of the guard's protective measures."}]`),z={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const s=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return s?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(s)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(s)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},F={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},P={key:1};function G(s,e,h,m,o,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(n.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),n.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",F,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
