By substituting small values of ( n ), we can observe that ( d ) can be either ( 1 ) or ( 7 ). 3. **Divisor Count Analysis:** Since ( n^5 + n^4 + 1 ) has exactly 6 divisors, it must be of the form ( p^5 ) or ( pq^2 ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are primes. The form ( p^5 ) is impossible because ( d in {1, 7} ) and ( n > 1 ).

Since ( n^5 + n^4 + 1 ) has 6 divisors, it must be of the form ( pq^2 ). This implies: [ n^3 - n + 1 = q^2, ] where ( q ) is a prime number. 5. **Case ( d = 7 ):** If ( d = 7 ), then ( 1 + n + n^2 = 7 ). Solving for ( n ): [ n^2 + n + 1 = 7 implies n^2 + n - 6 = 0. ] Solving this quadratic equation: [ n = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 24}}{2} = frac{-1 pm 5}{2}. ] This gives: [ n = 2 quad text{or} quad n = -3. ] Since ( n ) is a natural number, ( n = 2 ). Substituting ( n = 2 ) into ( n^3 - n + 1 ): [ 2^3 - 2 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7, ] which is not a perfect square. Therefore, ( d = 7 ) does not yield a valid solution. 6. **Conclusion:** Since ( d = 7 ) does not work, we conclude that ( n^3 - n + 1 = q^2 ) for some prime ( q ).

For these vectors, k=1 is chosen, meaning the rotation by 2pi/m realigns the vectors along their original directions, reinforcing that the vector sum is zero. 4. **Transformation of Vectors by Multiple Rotation**: If we apply a transformation mathbf{e} rightarrow D^{prime} mathbf{e} (where D^prime is an (l)-times rotation operator), the angle between the vector and the initial direction Ox is multiplied by l.

Summing all these systems still results in mathbf{0} since rotations preserve the zero vector sum property. 8. **Applying Multiple Rotations for Contradiction**: Consider applying an (l)-times rotation to all vectors. The first symmetric system collapses into one vector direction rendering it non-zero, forming our contradiction to the earlier consistent zero sum. 9. **Conclusion**: As soon as we encompass multiple symmetric systems of vectors and apply rotational transformation, it leads to certain regrouplings or collapses implying that at least two of the resultant regular polygons from the coloring would necessitate being equal.

Let f'(x) = 0, then -4x^2 - 2ax - 1 = 0, Delta = 4a^2 - 16 > 0, thus x_1 = frac{-a - sqrt{a^2 - 4}}{4}, x_2 = frac{-a + sqrt{a^2 - 4}}{4}, and 0 < x_1 < x_2 < -a, When x in (0, x_1), f'(x) < 0; when x in (x_1, x_2), f'(x) > 0; when x in (x_2, a), f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, x_1), monotonically increasing on (x_1, x_2), and monotonically decreasing on (x_2, a).

Starting from the point (9, 1), to reach y = 0 (the x-axis), we decrease y by 1 unit. 3. Since decreasing y by 1 unit increases x by 1 unit (due to the slope of -1), we find the x-coordinate of the intersection by adding 1 to the x-coordinate of the starting point (9, 1).

Thus, for our equation, the axis of symmetry is at t = 3. 3. **Calculate the time when the second ball reaches the same height as the first ball:** Since the second ball is thrown one second after the first, and considering the symmetry of the parabola, the two balls will be at the same height at a time that is symmetrically opposite to the launch time of the second ball with respect to the axis of symmetry t = 3. The first ball is thrown at t = 0, so it reaches its maximum height at t = 3. The second ball, thrown one second later, would ideally reach the same height at a time that is 1 second before t = 3, due to symmetry. This is because the time intervals on either side of the axis of symmetry (for events happening at the same height) are equal. Therefore, the second ball reaches the same height as the first ball 0.5 seconds before and after the axis of symmetry, which is at t = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 seconds after it is thrown.

Thus, we have: [ (x+a)(x+b)(x+12) = 0. ] This implies the roots are x = -a, x = -b, and x = -12. Since the problem states there are exactly 3 distinct roots, it follows that -a, -b, and -12 must all be different from each other and none of them can be -3 (to avoid division by zero in the original equation).

Thus, -3 is a root of this equation. Since the equation has exactly 1 distinct root, -3 must be the only root. **Step 3: Determining b** Since -6 is a root of the numerator but cannot be a root of the equation (to maintain only one distinct root), it must make the denominator zero. This implies: [ -6 + b = 0 Rightarrow b = 6. ] **Step 4: Determining a** For -2a not to introduce a new distinct root, it must either coincide with the existing root -3 or make the denominator zero.

This means that C is the minimum number of colors required to color G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. 2. **Consider Removing a Vertex:** Let v be a vertex in G, and consider the graph G' = G - v, which is the graph after removing v and all edges incident to v. 3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Suppose, for contradiction, that the chromatic number of G' is at most C-2. That is, G' can be properly colored with C-2 colors. 4. **Coloring G:** If G' can be colored with C-2 colors, reintroduce vertex v to G'. Since G was originally colored with C colors, we now seek to color G using at most C-1 colors by selecting a color for v among the at most C-1 colors available. 5. **Contradiction:** This contradicts the assumption that C was the chromatic number of G, since we have shown that G could be colored with fewer than C colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of G' can be at most C-1, and removing any single vertex from G can decrease the chromatic number by at most 1. **Conclusion:** Hence, the chromatic number of the graph cannot decrease by more than 1 when a single vertex (and all its incident edges) is removed. blacksquare Part (b) 1. **Case for ( n = 3 ):** - Let G be a cycle graph C_k with k vertices, where k is an odd number greater than 2.

In other words, J is a join of G and H. 3. **Chromatic Number of ( J ):** - For the complete graph H, chi(H) = n-3 since each vertex needs a unique color. - The odd cycle G requires 3 colors. - Therefore, the graph J will require n colors (sum of colors required by G and H without overlap). 4. **Effect of Removing a Vertex from ( J ):** - **Case 1: Vertex removed from G** - Removing a vertex from the odd cycle G breaks the cycle and it becomes a path, which can be colored with 2 colors. - The remaining vertices in H are still colored with n-3 colors. - Hence, (n-3) + 2 = n-1 colors are sufficient for coloring the graph after removing a vertex from G. - **Case 2: Vertex removed from H** - Removing one vertex from the complete graph H changes it to K_{n-4}. - So, H can now be colored with n-4 colors. - The odd cycle G still needs 3 colors. - Therefore, the reduced graph can be colored with (n-4) + 3 = n-1 colors. 5. **Conclusion:** - For n > 2, there are infinitely many graphs (constructed as above) such that removing any vertex decreases their chromatic number from n to n-1. boxed{text{Part (b) demonstrated the existence of such graphs for all } n > 2.}"},{"prompt":"Read the material: Find the value of 1+2+2^{2}+2^{3}+2^{4}+ldots +2^{2017}.

Denote by n_{1} the number of vertices of the polygon that lie on l such that both edges extending from each of these vertices lie in the upper half-plane, and by n_{2} the number of vertices for which both edges lie in the lower half-plane. 4.

Setting this equal to the distance from A to the focus gives us: [ 9 + frac{p}{2} = 12 ] Solving for p, we get: [ frac{p}{2} = 12 - 9 frac{p}{2} = 3 p = 6 ] Therefore, the value of p is boxed{6}, which corresponds to choice C."},{"prompt":"f mathbf{p}, mathbf{q}, and mathbf{r} are vectors such that mathbf{p} cdot mathbf{q} = 5, mathbf{p} cdot mathbf{r} = 2, and mathbf{q} cdot mathbf{r} = 4, then find [mathbf{q} cdot (5 mathbf{r} 3 mathbf{p}).]","completion":"Expanding the dot product, we get: [ mathbf{q} cdot (5 mathbf{r} - 3 mathbf{p}) = 5 mathbf{q} cdot mathbf{r} - 3 mathbf{p} cdot mathbf{q} ] Substituting the given values: [ mathbf{q} cdot (5 mathbf{r} - 3 mathbf{p}) = 5 cdot (-4) - 3 cdot 5 = -20 - 15 = boxed{-35}. ]"},{"prompt":"The incircle omega of triangle ABC , right angled at C , touches the circumcircle of its medial triangle at point F . Let OE be the tangent to omega from the midpoint O of the hypotenuse AB , distinct from AB .

Since ( ID perp DO ), the inversion circle is orthogonal to the incircle. - If ( C' ) is the foot of the altitude from ( C ) to ( AB ), then it is known that ( (C', U; D, E') = -1 ). By the harmonic conjugate property, ( OU cdot OC' = OD^2 ). 5. **Inversion and Tangency:** - Let ( L ) be another intersection of ( OF ) with the incircle. Since the inversion circle is orthogonal to the incircle, ( OD^2 = OL cdot OF ). - Since ( F ) lies on the nine-point circle, the image of the nine-point circle under inversion is a line ( UL ). - As the nine-point circle is tangent to the incircle at one point, ( UL ) must be tangent to the incircle, implying ( L = G ) (since both ( UL ) and ( UG ) are tangents to the incircle and not on ( AB )). 6. **Collinearity and Perpendicularity:** - It is well known that ( overline{C-D'-E-E'} ). - From ( measuredangle{CC'O} = measuredangle{CFO} = 90^circ = measuredangle{CFG} ), we get ( overline{C-G'-F} ). - Since ( UD ) and ( UG ) are tangents to the incircle, ( IU perp DG Rightarrow IC perp D'G' ), and it is also the perpendicular bisector. Hence, ( CG' = CD' ). 7. **Angle Chasing and Conclusion:** - ( measuredangle{CG'D'} = measuredangle{D'G'F} = measuredangle{G'D'C} = measuredangle{ED'G'} ), which gives us ( CG' = CD' ) and ( G'F = D'E ). - Therefore, ( CF = CE ).

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of the first train + Speed of the second train The speeds of the trains are given in kilometers per hour (kmph), so we need to convert them to meters per second (m/s) to be consistent with the distance we have in meters.

The probability that event A occurs exactly 6 times in 10 trials can be calculated using the binomial formula. For a binomial distribution, the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by: [ P(K = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} ] where binom{n}{k} is the binomial coefficient, and p is the probability of success on a single trial.

Since she gets four ears of corn per stalk and has 108 stalks, the total number of ears is: [108 times 4 = 432] 2. Next, understand that half the ears of corn have 500 kernels each, and the other half have 100 more kernels, which means 600 kernels each. To find out how many ears are in each half, we divide the total number of ears by 2: [432 div 2 = 216] 3. Now, calculate the total number of kernels from the first half of the ears: [216 times 500 = 108,000] 4. Then, calculate the total number of kernels from the second half of the ears: [216 times 600 = 129,600] 5.

The total weight of the group before the new person arrives is therefore 10A.

The new total weight of the group is then 10A + 40 kg. The new average weight of the group, which we'll call A', is the new total weight divided by the number of people, which is still 10. So we have: A' = (10A + 40 kg) / 10 To find the increase in the average weight, we subtract the original average (A) from the new average (A'): Increase in average weight = A' - A Increase in average weight = (10A + 40 kg) / 10 - A Increase in average weight = A + 4 kg - A Increase in average weight = 4 kg So the average weight increases by boxed{4} kg."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=x+xln x, if min Z, and (m2)(x2) < f(x) holds for any x > 2, then the maximum value of m is boxed{text{answer}}.

In which meridian plane is our eye located? What angle does this line make with the plane of the globe's equator? How does the answer change if we consider Székesfehérvár instead of Szombathely?","completion":": 1. **Assumption and Point Selection**: Assume our eye and the globe's center ( O ) are on the same horizontal plane, which also contains the globe's equator. Due to the \\"sufficiently far\\" distance, the observed image is essentially a frontal view, wherein the globe's contour appears as a circle and the equator appears as a horizontal diameter. 2. **Elevation Angle Analysis**: For any point ( Sz ) on the globe, the angle between the line of sight (the perceived radius ( O'' Sz'' )) and the equator's projection ( e'' ) is determined by the tangent function. Specifically, the vertical difference ( a ) (between ( O'' ) and ( Sz'' )) and the horizontal distance ( b ) (between the vertical projections through ( O'' ) and ( Sz'' )) determine this angle. Given the globe's radius ( R ) is normalized to 1 unit, we have [ a = | sin varphi |, ] where ( varphi ) is the latitude of ( Sz ) (southern latitudes are taken as negative). 3. **Horizontal Distance Calculation**: To calculate ( b ), we use the top-down view (first picture). Here, latitude circles are seen in true size with their centers at ( O ) and their radii represented clearly. The projection of a meridian (latitude-dependent semicircle) in this view helps in recognizing the apparent angles between meridian planes. Let ( x ) be the geographic longitude of the observer’s meridian. For a point ( Sz ) with longitude ( lambda ), we find [ b = O' S_z' sin (lambda - x) = cos varphi sin (lambda - x), ] as the distance between the planar projections ( O' ) and ( S_z' ) equals the latitude circle's radius ( cos varphi ). 4. **Angle Between Line of Sight and Equator**: [ tan alpha = - frac{sin varphi}{cos varphi sin (lambda - x)} = frac{tan varphi}{sin (lambda - x)}. ] 5. **Ensuring Co-linearity for Two Cities**: To see coordinates of Valparaiso (( V )) and ( Sz ) in alignment with the globe's center, these angles ( alpha ) must match (or their differences must be ( 180^circ )).

Therefore, the triangle whose vertices are the intersection points of the altitudes of triangles triangle AH_BH_C, triangle BH_AH_C, and triangle CH_AH_B is equal to the orthic triangle triangle H_AH_BH_C. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Thirtysix players are playing a game: from a deck of 36 playing cards, the players take turns randomly drawing one card each.

If the first player does not draw the ace of diamonds on the first try, the probability of this happening is ( frac{35}{36} ). 3. Then the second player effectively becomes the first player, and their probability of winning is now ( p_1 ) because the process is cyclic, i.e., the conditions reset each round without any influence from previous draws. 4.

This implies that each subsequent player's probability of winning is reduced by a factor of ( frac{35}{36} ) compared to the previous player.

This line has a slope of frac{1}{7} and passes through the origin (0,0). The rectangular region is defined by the vertices (0,0), (2009,0), (2009,2010), and (0,2010). The line y = frac{1}{7}x intersects the x-axis at (0,0) and the line x=2009 at the point (2009, frac{2009}{7}). These points, along with the origin, form a triangle. The area of this triangle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle, frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Here, the base is 2009 (the x-coordinate of the second vertex), and the height is frac{2009}{7} (the y-coordinate of the second vertex). Thus, the area of the triangle is frac{1}{2} times 2009 times frac{2009}{7}. The area of the rectangular region is found by multiplying its length and width, which are 2009 and 2010, respectively. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 2009 times 2010. The probability that a randomly picked point (x,y) from the rectangular region satisfies x > 7y is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle. This gives us the probability as frac{frac{1}{2} times 2009 times frac{2009}{7}}{2009 times 2010}. Simplifying this expression, we get frac{2009 times frac{2009}{14}}{2009 times 2010}.

Using the Law of Cosines, we find the cosine of x: [ begin{align*} cos x &= frac{(n + 1)^2 + (n + 2)^2 - n^2}{2(n + 1)(n + 2)} &= frac{n^2 + 2n + 1 + n^2 + 4n + 4 - n^2}{2(n + 1)(n + 2)} &= frac{2n^2 + 6n + 5}{2(n + 1)(n + 2)} &= frac{(n + 1)(n + 5)}{2(n + 1)(n + 2)} &= frac{n + 5}{2(n + 2)}. end{align*} ] 3. **Cosine of the largest angle**: The largest angle, y, is opposite the side of length n+2.

Therefore, Proposition A is true. - **Proposition B**: It mentions that a=3, b=4, c=5 form a Pythagorean triple. To verify this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). Plugging in the given values: [ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 Rightarrow 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 Rightarrow 9 + 16 = 25 Rightarrow 25 = 25 ] This equality holds, confirming that (3, 4, 5) is indeed a Pythagorean triple. Thus, Proposition B is true. - **Proposition C**: It claims that two angles with a common vertex and equal measures are vertical angles. However, this description more accurately describes adjacent angles or possibly congruent angles depending on their arrangement, but not specifically vertical angles. Vertical angles are the angles opposite each other when two lines cross. They are not defined by having a common vertex and equal measures alone, but by their positions across an intersection. Therefore, this proposition is false. - **Proposition D**: It states that the domain of the function y = sqrt{x-2} is x geqslant 2. The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. Since the square root function is only defined for non-negative arguments, the condition x-2 geqslant 0 must hold, which simplifies to x geqslant 2.

There are 15 freshmen sitting in a circle. 2. Only 6 handouts are available. 3. Each freshman can get at most one handout. 4. Any freshman without a handout should be able to read a neighbor's handout. We need to find the number of ways to distribute the handouts. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Symmetry Consideration:** Suppose we consider one of the freshmen, let's call this person A. The problem can be reduced by fixing this individual as a reference point. 2. **Gap Analysis:** When we distribute the 6 handouts among 15 people sitting in a circle, the sizes of the gaps between the people with handouts must sum to 15, minus the 6 people who get the handouts, which equals 9. Hence, we need to divide these 15 seats into 6 gaps where the total number of freshmen without handouts between these gaps should sum to 9. 3. **Possible Gaps:** Considering that no freshman is left alone without being able to see a handout from a neighbor: - The gaps could be (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2). - Alternatively, the gaps could be (0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2). 4. **Counting Arrangements of Gaps:** - For the (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2) combination: [ frac{6!}{3!3!} = frac{720}{6 times 6} = 20 ] - For the (0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2) combination: [ frac{6!}{1!1!4!} = frac{720}{24} = 30 ] 5. **Total Number of Arrangements:** Adding both arrangements: [ 20 + 30 = 50 ] 6. **Adjustment for Rotational Symmetry:** Since the 50 arrangements are counted with one fixed reference person (out of the 15), each arrangement can apply to any of the 15 positions around the circle.

Since we have no specific numbers for the salaries, we can't calculate the exact median and average salaries. However, we can infer that there must be at least one person in each income range to have a median, and since H is twice L, the minimum number of L must be 1 to have a non-zero number of high income earners. So, if L = 1, then: H = 2L = 2 * 1 = 2 M = L + H = 1 + 2 = 3 e = 6L = 6 * 1 = 6 Therefore, the minimum number of students, e, in the class is boxed{6} ."},{"prompt":"The average of some numbers is calculated as 15.

Each vertex of the triangle has a circle with a common radius ( y ), and another circle with center ( O ) has an area 4 times that of the circle centered at ( P ). 2. The area ratio of the two circles ( frac{A_{odot O}}{A_{odot P}} = 4 ) implies: [ 4 = frac{pi r_O^2}{pi r_P^2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 4 = frac{r_O^2}{r_P^2} ] Taking the square root on both sides, we get: [ frac{r_O}{r_P} = 2 ] Hence, ( r_O = 2r_P ). 3.

To find the constant C, we use the initial condition v(0) = v_0 = 20 km/h: [ 20 = C e^{-frac{k}{m} cdot 0} implies C = 20 ] Hence, the velocity function becomes: [ v(t) = 20 e^{-frac{k}{m} t} ] 6. We are given that the velocity after 40 seconds (or (frac{40}{3600}) hours) has decreased to v_1 = 8 km/h. So, we use this to determine frac{k}{m}: [ 8 = 20 e^{-frac{k}{m} cdot frac{1}{90}} ] Solving for e^{-frac{k}{m}}: [ frac{8}{20} = e^{-frac{k}{m} cdot frac{1}{90}} implies frac{2}{5} = e^{-frac{k}{m} cdot frac{1}{90}} implies e^{-frac{k}{m} cdot frac{1}{90}} = frac{2}{5} ] Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: [ -frac{k}{m} cdot frac{1}{90} = ln left( frac{2}{5} right) implies frac{k}{m} = -90 ln left( frac{2}{5} right) ] 7. Now we need to find the velocity at t=2 minutes (or (frac{2}{60}) hours): [ v(2) = 20 e^{-frac{k}{m} cdot frac{2}{60}} ] Using frac{k}{m} = -90 ln left( frac{2}{5} right): [ v(2) = 20 e^{90 ln left( frac{2}{5} right) cdot frac{1}{30}} ] Simplifying further: [ v(2) = 20 e^{3 ln left( frac{2}{5} right)} = 20 left(e^{ln left( frac{2}{5} right)}right)^3 = 20 left( frac{2}{5} right)^3 ] [ v(2) = 20 left( frac{2}{5} right)^3 = 20 cdot frac{8}{125} = 20 cdot frac{8}{125} = frac{160}{125} = 1.28 text{ km/h} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{1.28 text{ km/h}} ]"},{"prompt":"John is writing an article limited to 48,000 words.

Consequently, the probability that a citizen opposes the policy is P(O) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. 2. **Calculate the Probability for Each Specific Sequence:** We are interested in the cases where exactly two out of four citizens support the new policy. The specific sequences where this can happen are: - SSOO, SOSO, SOOS, OSSO, OSOS, OOSS. The probability of each sequence occurring is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event in the sequence. For example, for SSOO: [ P(SSOO) = P(S) cdot P(S) cdot P(O) cdot P(O) = 0.6 cdot 0.6 cdot 0.4 cdot 0.4 = 0.0576 ] Similarly, the probabilities for the other sequences are also calculated based on their respective arrangements. 3. **Calculate the Total Probability:** Since these sequences are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen at the same time), the total probability of exactly two citizens supporting the policy is the sum of the probabilities of these sequences: [ P(text{exactly two } S) = 6 times 0.0576 = 0.3456 ] 4. **Conclusion:** The probability that exactly two out of four randomly selected citizens support the new policy is 0.3456.

The center of this rotation must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AC. - Similarly, consider the rotation that maps point D onto point B. The center for this rotation must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment BD. 3. **Intersection of Perpendicular Bisectors**: Since AC and BD are not parallel line segments, their perpendicular bisectors will intersect at exactly one point, say P. This point P is the potential center of rotation. 4. **Analyzing the 90^{circ} Rotation**: - Look at the scenario where we rotate the segment CD about point P. If we perform a 90^{circ} rotation around P, the images of points C and D will map to new positions. Given that both segments AB and CD are of equal length and arranged in the described fashion, this rotation should map segment CD exactly onto segment AB. - It's important to note that the perpendicular nature of the segments means that a 90^{circ} rotation will align them perfectly. Specifically, CD perp AB confirms that the angle of rotation required is indeed 90^{circ}. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there exists a point P in the plane such that a 90^{circ} rotation around P maps the segment CD onto AB. This confirms that the two equal-length segments can indeed be transformed into one another through planar rotation.

If John sells 20 bags to adults and 10 bags to children, how much profit does he make after accounting for all the additional costs?","completion":"First, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn bags John buys. He buys 30 bags in total (20 for adults and 10 for children). Since he buys 20 or more bags, he gets a 10% discount on each bag. The original price per bag is 4, so the discount per bag is 10% of 4, which is 0.40. The discounted price per bag is therefore 4 - 0.40 = 3.60. The total cost for 30 bags is 30 bags * 3.60/bag = 108. Next, let's calculate the packaging cost for 30 bags. The packaging cost per bag is 0.50, so the total packaging cost is 30 bags * 0.50/bag = 15. Now, let's add the transportation fees, which are a flat 10. So, the total cost for John is the cost of the bags plus the packaging cost plus the transportation fees: Total cost = 108 + 15 + 10 = 133. Now, let's calculate the revenue John makes from selling the bags. He sells 20 bags to adults at 8 each and 10 bags to children at 6 each. Revenue from adults = 20 bags * 8/bag = 160. Revenue from children = 10 bags * 6/bag = 60. Total revenue = 160 + 60 = 220. Finally, let's calculate John's profit. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost Profit = 220 - 133 = 87.

When a > 0, if Delta = 1-8a leq 0, i.e., a geq frac{1}{8}, then f'(x) leq 0. Therefore, f(x) is a decreasing function on (0,+infty), which implies that f(x) has no extreme points.

Rhett has been late on two of his monthly rent payments, which means he owes 2 * 1350 = 2700. He will be able to pay this amount with 3/5 of his next month's salary after taxes. This means that after paying 10% tax, 3/5 of his remaining salary will be equal to 2700. First, let's find out what his salary is after taxes. If he pays 10% tax, he is left with 100% - 10% = 90% of his salary. In decimal form, this is 0.9 * S.

Step 2: Stir Cup 2 and pour one-quarter back to Cup 1 - Total liquid in Cup 2 before pouring back = 8 ounces. - Amount of liquid transferred back to Cup 1 = frac{8}{4} = 2 ounces. Since the liquid in Cup 2 is a mixture of 1 ounce of coffee to 7 ounces of milk, the composition of the mixture is frac{1}{8} coffee and frac{7}{8} milk. When transferring 2 ounces back to Cup 1, the amounts of coffee and milk transferred are: - Coffee transferred back = 2 times frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{4} ounce. - Milk transferred back = 2 times frac{7}{8} = 1.75 ounces.

This follows from the construction conditions and the fact that (Y) and (C) are both perpendicular projections relative to similar sides of the square. - Consequently, (BY = CD). Thus, the distance from (B) to (Y) equals the distance from (C) to (D). 5. **Completing the Square Construction:** - We have established point (Y), which lies on the perpendicular from (B). - Draw line (AY) as one side of the square. - From point (C), draw a line perpendicular to (AY). This line will intersect (Y) at (D), if extending from (B) parallel to (AY). 6. **Final Lines and Square:** - To finalize the square, extend lines from points (C) and (D) perpendicular to line (L). - Join these intersections ensuring to maintain right angles and equal lengths to complete the geometry of the square. # Conclusion By using properties of perpendicular projections and congruent triangles, we accurately determine precise locations of the points on the square.

The monthly establishment charges are fixed at Rs 75,000, regardless of the number of looms. The profit from each loom is the sales contribution per loom minus the manufacturing expense per loom. So, the profit per loom is: Profit per loom = Sales contribution per loom - Manufacturing expense per loom Profit per loom = (Rs 5,00,000 / L) - (Rs 1,50,000 / L) When one loom breaks down, the total number of looms becomes L - 1.

If the ( t )-th digit from the right is 1, write ( 2^{t-1} ) and then sum up all the written powers of 2. The sum is exactly ( m ) and all of the summands are positive divisors of ( 2^n ). Hence, the lemma holds. 2. **Lemma 2**: If ( m ) is an odd natural number and ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( 2^n geq m ), then ( 2^n cdot m ) is ziba. **Proof**: - The case ( m = 1 ) holds since all the numbers smaller than ( 2^{n+1} ) are writable in the desired way and ( 2^n leq 2^{n+1} - 1 ) if and only if ( 2^n geq 1 ), which is true. - If ( m > 1 ), consider the sets: [ A = { 2^alpha cdot m mid alpha leq n, alpha in mathbb{Z} } ] [ B = { 2^alpha mid alpha leq n, alpha in mathbb{Z} } ] Now, ( 2^n cdot m = 2^n cdot m ) and for any ( 0 < k < 2^n cdot m ), there exists unique ( q in mathbb{N}, r in mathbb{W} ) such that ( k = mq + r ) and ( q < 2^n ) and ( 0 leq r leq m - 1 ). According to Lemma 1, ( q ) can be written as the sum of some distinct elements of ( B ), so ( mq ) can be written as the sum of some distinct elements in ( A ). - If ( r ) is nonzero, since ( r < m leq 2^n ), ( r ) can be written as the sum of some distinct elements of ( B ). Since ( A ) and ( B ) don't have any element in common (all of the elements of ( B ) are powers of 2 and there is an odd prime which divides ( m ) since ( m > 1 ) and all elements of ( A )), and all their elements are positive divisors of ( 2^n cdot m ), Lemma 2 is proved (if ( r = 0 ), we are done after the first part). 3. **Main Proof**: We need to prove that the equation ( f(x) = x^2 + x + 2022 equiv 0 pmod{2^c} ) has at least one solution for any ( c geq 2 ), ( k in mathbb{N} ). **Induction on ( c )**: - Base case ( c = 2 ) holds because ( f(0) = 0 pmod{4} ). - Suppose ( f(x_0) = 0 pmod{2^s} ). It can be observed that ( f(x_0 + 2^s h) = f(x_0) + 2^s f'(h) pmod{2^{s+1}} ) where ( f'(x) = 2x + 1 ). If ( x_1 = 0 pmod{2^s} ), then ( x_1 = 0 ) or ( 2^s pmod{2^{s+1}} ). - So either ( f(x_0) = 0 ) or ( f(x_0 + 2^s) = 0 pmod{2^{s+1}} ), and the induction is complete. 4. Suppose the contrary of the problem's claim, so there exist finitely many ( x ) such that ( f(x) ) is ziba. Name them ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_t ). All the numbers ( f(r_i) ) are finite, so there exists a ( u ) such that ( 2^u > max { f(r_i) } ) and ( u > 11 ). ( f(x) equiv 0 pmod{2^u} ) has a root; so ( f(x) equiv 0 pmod{2^u} ) has a root in the set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 2^u - 1}) like ( T ) and ( f(0) neq 0 pmod{2^u} ). If ( f(T) = 2^alpha cdot v ) such that ( v ) is odd, we know ( alpha geq u ). - If ( v leq 2^alpha ), ( f(T) ) would be ziba too by Lemma 2, which is in contrast with the way ( T ) is chosen and the assumption that the problem's claim is wrong. - If ( v > 2^alpha ), ( 2^u cdot (2^u + 1) leq 2^alpha cdot (2^alpha + 1) leq f(x) leq (2^u - 1)^2 + 2^u + 2021 ), which is again in contrast with ( u > 11 ). So there are infinite natural values for ( x ) such that ( f(x) ) is ziba and the problem is proved.

It will be visited only if it is adjacent to a town with a lower number or if it is the starting point of the 100th trip. 4. **Inductive Step:** - Suppose we remove the town numbered 100 and its adjacent town (which must be the town with the lowest number adjacent to 100). - This reduces the problem to 98 towns and we need to ensure that each of these 98 towns is visited twice. 5. **Maximizing Roads:** - To maximize the number of roads, we need to ensure that each town is connected to as many other towns as possible while maintaining the condition that each town is visited twice. - The maximum number of roads in a complete graph with n vertices is given by frac{n(n-1)}{2}. 6. **Constructing the Graph:** - We can construct a graph where each town i (for i leq 49) is adjacent to all towns numbered greater than i. - This ensures that each town is visited twice and maximizes the number of roads. 7. **Calculating the Number of Roads:** - For n = 100, the maximum number of roads in a complete graph is frac{100 times 99}{2} = 4950. - However, we need to ensure that each town is visited exactly twice, which means we need to remove some roads to maintain this condition. 8. **Final Calculation:** - By removing the town numbered 100 and its adjacent town, we reduce the problem to 98 towns. - The number of roads in a complete graph with 98 towns is frac{98 times 97}{2} = 4753. - Adding back the roads involving the town numbered 100, we get 4753 + 98 = 4851.

There are 9 possible types: [ (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) ] 5. **Counting the types:** Let ( N(i, j) ) denote the number of integers in S of type (i, j). We need to analyze the conditions that guarantee the product of 3 numbers is a perfect cube. 6. **Conditions for forming a perfect cube:** - If ( N(i, j) geq 3 ) for some ((i, j)), then these three numbers' product is a perfect cube. - If there exists an ( i ) such that ( N(i, 0) cdot N(i, 1) cdot N(i, 2) neq 0 ), the product of these three is a perfect cube. - If there exists a ( j ) such that ( N(0, j) cdot N(1, j) cdot N(2, j) neq 0 ), the product of these three is a perfect cube. - If there exists nonzero ( N(i_1, j_1) ), ( N(i_2, j_2) ), and ( N(i_3, j_3) ) such that ({i_1, i_2, i_3} = {j_1, j_2, j_3} = {0, 1, 2}). 7. **Analysis using the pigeonhole principle:** Since we have 9 types and 9 integers in S, at least 5 of these ( N(i, j) ) are non-zero.

Then h'(a) = frac{1 - 4a}{2a^2}. We know that this function is decreasing when a ∈ (frac{1}{2}, 1), and h(a) < h(frac{1}{2}) = 2ln2 - 3 < 0, satisfying the proposition. Thus, a > frac{1}{2} satisfies the proposition. In summary, when a > 0, for any x₁ ∈ (0, 2], there exists x₂ ∈ (0, 2] such that f(x₁) < g(x₂). Alternative method for (2): f(x) = frac{1}{2}ax^2^ - (2a + 1)x + 2lnx = frac{a(x^2 - 4x)}{2} - (x - 2lnx). Since a > 0 and x ∈ (0, 2], frac{a(x^2 - 4x)}{2} < 0. Let h(x) = x - 2lnx, then h'(x) = 1 - frac{2}{x} = frac{x - 2}{x}. So h(x) is decreasing on (0, 2], and h(x) ≥ h(2) = 2 - 2ln2 > 0. Therefore, when a > 0 and x ∈ (0, 2], f(x) < 0. Hence, when a > 0, for any x₁ ∈ (0, 2], there exists x₂ ∈ (0, 2] such that f(x₁) < g(x₂).

We have (PM = QM) and hence (PQ) is symmetric with respect to (M). - By the construction of (APBR), segments (AP) and (BR) are equal and parallel, and (BP) and (AR) are also equal and parallel. - Therefore, ( AR ) and ( QC ) must be parallel and equal, as (BP) and (AR) get reflected onto (CQ ).

Denote by (a) and (h) respectively the side of the base (ABCD) and the height of the pyramid. We will make a section through points (P), (A), and (C) so that the resulting triangle is symmetrical about the line containing (O). 2. Since point (O) lies in the plane of this section, the section is an isosceles triangle with base (a sqrt{2}), inscribed in a circle of radius (R). 3. Let the extension of the radius (OP) intersect the segment (AC) at point (M) and the circle at point (K). Thus, (M) is the midpoint of (AC), and (CM) is the altitude of the right triangle (PCK), drawn from the vertex of the right angle. 4. Since (CM) is an altitude of the right triangle, we have: [ CM^2 = PM cdot MK ] Given that (M) is the midpoint of (AC), we have (PM = h) and (MK = 2R - h). Therefore: [ left(frac{1}{2} aright)^2 = h(2R - h) ] From this, we can derive the relationship: [ a^2 = 2h(2R - h) ] 5. Denote the volume of the pyramid by (V(h)). Then: [ V(h) = frac{1}{3} S_{ABCD} cdot PM ] where (S_{ABCD} = a^2) and substituting (a^2 = 2h(2R - h)): [ V(h) = frac{1}{3} cdot 2h(2R - h) cdot h = frac{2}{3} h^2 (2R - h) ] 6. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the function (V(h) = frac{2}{3} h^2 (2R - h)) on the interval ((0, 2R)). First Method: 7. To find the critical points, solve the equation (V'(h) = 0): [ V'(h) = frac{2}{3} left(h^2 (2R - h)right)' = frac{2}{3} (2Rh^2 - h^3)' = frac{2}{3} (4Rh - 3h^2) ] Factor out (h): [ frac{2}{3} (4Rh - 3h^2) = frac{2}{3} h (4R - 3h) = 0 ] 8. The only root in the interval ((0, 2R)) is (h = frac{4}{3} R). 9. Since the derivative changes from positive to negative through this point, we can conclude this is a maximum. Thus: [ Vleft(frac{4}{3} Rright) = frac{2}{3} left(frac{4}{3} Rright)^2 left(2R - frac{4}{3} Rright) = frac{2}{3} cdot frac{16}{9} R^2 cdot frac{2R}{3} = frac{64}{81} R^3 ] Second Method: 10. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for three numbers, we obtain: [ V(h) = frac{2}{3} h^2 (2R - h) = frac{2}{3} pi cdot 4 cdot frac{1}{2} h cdot frac{1}{2} h (2R - h) geq frac{frac{8}{3}}{3} pi cdot left(frac{frac{1}{2} h + frac{1}{2} h + (2R - h)}{3}right)^3 = frac{frac{8}{3}}{3} pi cdot frac{frac{5}{27}}{27} = frac{64}{81} pi R^3 ] Equality is attained if (frac{1}{2} h = 2R - h), which gives (h = frac{4}{3}R).

The smallest integers greater than ( 2^{5/3} ) and ( 3^{2/3} ) are ( 2^2 ) and ( 3 ), so ( n ) must be divisible by ( 2^2 ) and ( 3 ). Thus, ( n ) must have factors of ( 2^2 ), ( 3 ), and ( 5 ) from both sets of constraints. The least common multiple of ( 4, 3, ) and ( 5 ) is ( 60 ). This ( n ) satisfies: - ( n^2 = 60^2 = 3600 ), which is divisible by ( 50 ), - ( n^3 = 60^3 = 216000 ), which is divisible by ( 288 ).

It is known that the price of each box is 26 yuan. Let x represent the price of each bottle of this brand of beverage. What equation can be set up to find the price of each bottle of this brand of beverage?","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the promotion and its effect on the price per bottle. Given: - The promotion is \\"buy one get three free,\\" which effectively means for every bottle you buy, you get three additional bottles for free. - This promotion results in a discount of 0.6 yuan per bottle compared to the original price. - The price of each box, which contains four bottles (since buying one gives you three free), is 26 yuan. - Let x represent the original price of each bottle of this brand of beverage. From the information given, we can deduce that the price of each bottle, when bought as part of this promotion, is x - 0.6 yuan. This is because the promotion offers a discount of 0.6 yuan per bottle. The total cost of a box (four bottles) at the promotional price is 26 yuan. However, since the promotion effectively makes each bottle cost x - 0.6 yuan, and you get three bottles for free for each one you buy, you only pay for one bottle in every set of four. Therefore, the cost of four bottles at the promotional price is equivalent to the cost of one bottle at the original price minus the discount. To find the relationship between the original price per bottle (x) and the discounted price (x - 0.6), we set up the equation based on the total cost of a box and the number of bottles: [ frac{26}{x - 0.6} - frac{26}{x} = 3 ] This equation represents the difference in the number of bottles you can buy with 26 yuan at the promotional price versus the original price, which is given as three bottles.

A sphere with a unit radius touches all three rays. We need to find the distance from the center of the sphere ( O ) to the initial point of the rays ( C ). 1. **Understanding the geometry:** - Let the rays be ( e_1, e_2, ) and ( e_3 ). - The common point is ( C ). - The center of the sphere is ( O ). - The points of tangency are ( E_1, E_2, ) and ( E_3 ) respectively, with ( OE_1 perp CE_1 ), ( OE_2 perp CE_2 ), and ( OE_3 perp CE_3 ). 2. **Properties of tangency:** - From an external point to a sphere, the tangents drawn are equal. Hence, ( CE_1 = CE_2 = CE_3 ). - Therefore, triangles ( CE_1E_2 ), ( CE_2E_3 ), and ( CE_3E_1 ) are congruent equilateral triangles, forming a regular tetrahedron with ( C ) at the apex. 3. **Determine the location of ( O ):** - Both ( O ) and ( C ) are equidistant from points on the base triangle ( E_1E_2E_3 ). Hence they lie in the perpendicular bisector plane of ( E_1E_2 ). - Similarly, ( O ) is also in the perpendicular bisector planes of ( E_1E_3 ) and ( E_2E_3 ). - Thus, ( CO ) is perpendicular to the plane ( E_1E_2E_3 ), implying ( O ) lies on the altitude of the tetrahedron drawn from ( C ). 4. **Calculate the altitude of the tetrahedron:** - The base ( E_1E_2E_3 ) is an equilateral triangle with side length ( c = CE_1 ). - The centroid ( K ) of the equilateral triangle ( E_1E_2E_3 ) divides each altitude into a ratio of ( 2:1 ). - In a triangle of side length ( c ), the altitude is ( frac{c sqrt{3}}{2} ), so ( KE_1 = frac{c sqrt{3}}{3} ). 5. **Using the tangent spheres:** - The distances involved are ( CO ), ( OE_1 ), and ( KE_1 ). Given that the radius ( OE_1 = 1 ), and from similar triangles ( CO : OE_1 = CE_1 : KE_1 = c : frac{c sqrt{3}}{3} ), we get ( CO = frac{c cdot 3}{sqrt{3}} = c sqrt{3} ). 6. **Final Step:** - The key is knowing ( OE_1 = 1 ) and solving ( c sqrt{3} ). - Here, ( frac{c cdot (3/sqrt{3})}{c/sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3} ).

We need to show that for every ( n ) satisfying ( 1 leq n leq frac{p}{2} ), the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{p-2n} ) is divisible by ( n ). For ( p = 2 ), the only possibility for ( n ) is ( n = 1 ). Since ( binom{1}{2-2 cdot 1} = binom{1}{0} = 1 ), and 1 is divisible by 1, the condition is met. For odd primes ( p ), consider the binomial identity: [ (p-2n) cdot binom{n}{p-2n} = n cdot binom{n-1}{p-2n-1} ] Examine the terms: - Since ( p geq 2n ) and ( p ) is prime, both ( p-2n ) and ( n ) are non-zero. - Let ( d = gcd(p-2n, n) ). Since ( d ) divides ( p ) and ( d leq n < p ), we must have ( d = 1 ) because ( p ) is a prime. Therefore, ( p-2n ) and ( n ) are relatively prime, which implies ( gcd(p-2n, n) = 1 ).

Therefore, we differentiate f(x) with respect to x to find the slope of the tangent line at x=1: f'(x) = frac{4}{x} - 2x. Evaluating the derivative at x=1, we get f'(1) = 4 - 2 cdot 1 = 2. Since f(1) = 4ln(1) - 1^2 = 0 - 1 = -1, the tangent line at the point (1, f(1)) must have a slope of 2 and pass through the point (1, -1). Using the point-slope form of a line: y - (-1) = 2(x - 1), simplifying this we get the equation of the tangent line as: y + 1 = 2(x - 1), which can be rewritten as boxed{2x - y - 3 = 0}. 2. For a > 0, we consider the first derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{4a}{x} - 2x, which simplifies to f'(x) = frac{2(2a - x^2)}{x}. A critical point occurs where f'(x) = 0, which happens when 2a - x^2 = 0; solving for x gives x = sqrt{2a}. To determine the nature of this critical point, we consider whether f'(x) changes sign as x passes through sqrt{2a}. For 0 < x < sqrt{2a}, the numerator 2a - x^2 is positive, hence f'(x) > 0, and f(x) is increasing. For x > sqrt{2a}, the numerator is negative, hence f'(x) < 0, and f(x) is decreasing. We conclude that the function f(x) has a maximum at x = sqrt{2a} since the derivative changes from positive to negative.

If she loses 9 individual shoes, and a matching pair must have the same type and color, what is the greatest number of matching pairs she could have left? Consider the fact that she might have multiple pairs of the same type and color.","completion":"Marcella starts with 25 pairs of shoes. If she loses 9 individual shoes, she could potentially lose 9 pairs if each lost shoe is from a different pair. However, since we want to maximize the number of matching pairs she has left, we should consider the best-case scenario where she loses shoes in such a way that the least number of pairs are affected. The best-case scenario would be if she loses shoes from the same type and color, as this would affect the fewest number of pairs. Since she has 5 different types and 5 different colors, she could have multiple pairs of the same type and color. Let's assume the best-case scenario where she loses shoes from the same type and color. If she loses 1 shoe from a pair, she still has 1 complete pair of that type and color. If she loses 2 shoes of the same type and color, she loses 1 pair. To maximize the number of pairs left, we want her to lose as few complete pairs as possible. If she loses 9 shoes, she could lose 1 shoe from 9 different pairs, which would leave her with 16 complete pairs (25 - 9 = 16). However, if she loses 2 shoes from the same type and color, she loses 1 complete pair, and if she loses a third shoe of the same type and color, she still loses only that 1 complete pair. So, the greatest number of matching pairs she could have left would be if she loses shoes in such a way that the losses are concentrated in as few types and colors as possible. For example, if she loses 3 shoes of one type and color, 3 shoes of another type and color, and 3 shoes of a third type and color, she would lose 3 complete pairs (one from each type and color), leaving her with 22 complete pairs (25 - 3 = 22).

According to the problem, the neighboring university is 10 years younger than the hospital, so the university is (H - 10) years old. The town library is L years old, and it is 20 years older than the university, so L = (H - 10) + 20 = H + 10. The sum of the ages of the hospital and Grant is five times the age of the university, so we have: H + 25 = 5(H - 10) H + 25 = 5H - 50 25 + 50 = 5H - H 75 = 4H H = 75 / 4 H = 18.75 Since the hospital cannot be a fraction of a year old, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's try again. The sum of the ages of the hospital and Grant is five times the age of the university: H + 25 = 5(H - 10) H + 25 = 5H - 50 25 + 50 = 5H - H 75 = 4H H = 75 / 4 H = 18.75 This result is still a fraction, which doesn't make sense for the age of a building. Let's check our steps again. We have the equation: H + 25 = 5(H - 10) H + 25 = 5H - 50 Now, let's solve for H correctly: 25 + 50 = 5H - H 75 = 4H H = 75 / 4 H = 18.75 The mistake is consistent, which suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or our interpretation of it. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. The problem states that in five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital. Currently, Grant is 25 years old, so in five years, he will be 25 + 5 = 30 years old. At that time, he will be 2/3 the age of the hospital, so we can write the equation: 30 = (2/3) * (H + 5) Now, let's solve for H: 30 = (2/3) * (H + 5) 45 = H + 5 H = 45 - 5 H = 40 Now we have the correct current age of the hospital, which is 40 years old. The university is 10 years younger than the hospital, so the university is: 40 - 10 = 30 years old.

This implies that (R) subtends equal angles to (A) and (B): [ angle RAQ = angle RAP = angle RPA ] Thus, triangles (triangle RAQ) and (triangle RPA) are similar by AA similarity criterion. 3. **Similarity Ratio**: - Using the similarity of (triangle RAQ) and (triangle RPA), establish the ratio: [ frac{RA}{RP} = frac{AQ}{AP} ] Given triangle similarity, the similarity ratio (frac{RA}{RP}) can be derived from the radii properties and points on the circle.

Define (x_i = frac{1}{a_i}). Using this substitution, we aim to convert the given inequality into a more manageable form. 1. **Substitute (x_i = frac{1}{a_i})** Consider the original expression: [ frac{a_i a_j}{a_i + a_j} ] Using (x_i = frac{1}{a_i}) and (x_j = frac{1}{a_j}), we can rewrite (a_i) and (a_j) as follows: [ a_i = frac{1}{x_i} quad text{and} quad a_j = frac{1}{x_j} ] Therefore, the expression inside the summation becomes: [ frac{frac{1}{x_i} cdot frac{1}{x_j}}{frac{1}{x_i} + frac{1}{x_j}} = frac{frac{1}{x_i x_j}}{frac{x_j + x_i}{x_i x_j}} = frac{1}{x_i + x_j} ] Consequently, our original inequality pertains to summing these fractions: [ sum_{i<j} frac{1}{x_i + x_j} ] 2. **Transform the problem via an inequality** We utilize the known inequality: [ frac{4}{x + y} leq frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} ] Applying this, we derive: [ frac{1}{x_i + x_j} geq frac{1}{4} left(frac{1}{x_i} + frac{1}{x_j}right) ] 3. **Apply the inequality to the sum:** Applying the above to our summation, we get: [ sum_{i<j} frac{1}{x_i + x_j} geq sum_{i<j} frac{1}{4} left(frac{1}{x_i} + frac{1}{x_j}right) ] 4. **Simplify the resulting sum:** The summation can be broken apart and simplified. Consider each term in the series: [ sum_{i<j} left(frac{1}{x_i} + frac{1}{x_j}right) ] Observing the symmetry in the terms allows us to re-index: [ = frac{1}{4} left( (n-1) sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{x_i} right) ] Given the symmetry and the fact that each pair ((i,j)) is counted twice, we simplify this sum by restructuring: [ sum_{i<j} left(frac{1}{x_i} + frac{1}{x_j}right) = (n-1) sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{x_i} ] Also, noting (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n = 1), we derive: [ sum_{i} frac{1}{x_i} = sum_{i} a_i = 1 ] 5. **Combine the results to finalize the proof:** Plugging these observations back into our expression, we arrive finally at: [ sum_{i < j} frac{1}{x_i + x_j} geq frac{n-1}{4} sum_{i} frac{1}{x_i} = frac{n-1}{4} ] This proves the inequality: [ sum_{i<j} frac{a_i a_j}{a_i + a_j} leqslant frac{n-1}{4} ] Concluding, we have: (boxed{frac{n-1}{4}}) (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"A box contains 10 tablets of medicine A and 13 tablets of medicine B.

The *pseudoperimeter* of a polygon is the sum of the pseudolengths of its edges. 6. **Pseudoperimeter Calculation:** Suppose we have x edges of odd pseudolength and y edges of even pseudolength. The pseudoperimeter of the polygon is always 2012, so we have: [ x + 2y leq 2012 ] 7. **Parity of Pseudolengths:** The pseudolength of an edge overline{ab} has the same parity as a + b pmod{2012}. Therefore, every edge with an odd pseudolength must occupy an odd residue class modulo 2012. There are 1006 odd residue classes, so: [ x leq 1006 ] 8. **Maximizing x + y:** We want to maximize x + y. Using the constraints: [ x + y = frac{(x + 2y) + x}{2} leq frac{2012 + 1006}{2} = 1509 ] Thus, the maximal k such that we can choose k vertices from the given 2012 and construct a convex k-gon without parallel sides is 1509.

To find the effective rotation, we subtract the full circle: 480 - 360 = 120 degrees. 2. **Analyze the initial angle**: Initially, the angle ACB is 40 degrees. The first part of the rotation will decrease this angle. 3. **Calculate the decrease to zero**: The first 40 degrees of the 120-degree rotation will bring the angle ACB down to 0 degrees. This is because the rotation starts from angle ACB and decreases it to 0. 4. **Determine the remaining rotation**: After decreasing the angle to 0 degrees, we have 120 - 40 = 80 degrees of rotation left. 5. **Conclusion**: The remaining 80 degrees of rotation will form the new acute angle ACB.

Specifically, for a general quadrilateral, the following equation holds: [ AB^2 + BC^2 + CD^2 + DA^2 geq AC^2 + BD^2 ] where (M) and (N) are the midpoints of the diagonals (AC) and (BD), respectively. 3. This theorem states that for any quadrilateral, the sum of the squares of its sides is greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of its diagonals. 4.

Without loss of generality, assign coordinates to the vertices as (A(x_1, y_1)), (B(x_2, y_2)), (C(x_3, y_3)), and (D(x_4, y_4)). 5.

Note that the sum of the reciprocals of the elements of ( S ) is invariant under the operation described. Specifically, if ( a ) and ( b ) are replaced by ( frac{ab}{a+b} ), then: [ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{a+b}{ab} = frac{1}{left(frac{ab}{a+b}right)} ] This shows that the sum of the reciprocals remains unchanged. 4.

Clearly, our objective is to find ( a_{2000} ) since an \\"优团\\" corresponds to subsets where the sum is 0 modulo 5. 3. **Subset Counting:** For any set ( S_n ): [ a_n + b_n + c_n + d_n + e_n = 2^n ] This follows because there are ( 2^n ) subsets of ( S_n ), and each subset's sum must fit one of the five categories (0, 1, 2, 3,) or (4 mod 5). 4. **Recurrence Relations:** Using simple combinatorial arguments and properties of modulo arithmetic, we derive the recurrence relations for a_n and related sequences: [ begin{aligned} a_{5n} &= 2 a_{5n-1}, a_{5n-1} &= a_{5n-2} + b_{5n-2}, a_{5n-2} &= a_{5n-3} + c_{5n-3}, b_{5n-2} &= b_{5n-3} + d_{5n-3}. end{aligned} ] From these, we get: [ begin{aligned} a_{5n} &= 2 (a_{5n-3} + b_{5n-3} + c_{5n-3} + d_{5n-3}) &= 2 (2^{5n-3} - e_{5n-3}). end{aligned} ] 5. **Rewriting with Smaller Indices:** Since: [ e_{5n-3} = e_{5n-4} + c_{5n-4}, e_{5n-4} = e_{5n-5} + d_{5n-5}, c_{5n-4} = c_{5n-5} + b_{5n-5}, ] we proceed to express everything in terms of smaller indices: [ begin{aligned} a_{5n} &= 2 left(2^{5n-3} - b_{5n-5} - c_{5n-5} - d_{5n-5} - e_{5n-5}right) &= 2 left(2^{5n-3} - 2^{5n-5} + a_{5n-5}right) &= 3 cdot 2^{5n-4} + 2 a_{5n-5}. end{aligned} ] 6. **Recursive Expansion:** Applying the recurrence relation iteratively, we find: [ begin{aligned} a_{5n} &= 3 cdot 2^{5n-4} + 3 cdot 2^{5n-8} + 4 a_{5n-10} &= 3 left(2^{5n-4} + 2^{5n-8} + cdots + 2^{5n-4n}right) + 2^n a_0 &= 3 cdot 2^n frac{2^{4n} - 1}{2^4 - 1} + 2^n. end{aligned} ] 7. **Specific Solution for n = 400:** Plugging in n = 400, we get: [ a_{2000} = 2^{400} left[frac{1}{5} left(2^{1600} - 1right) + 1right]. ] 8. **Subtracting the Empty Set:** Since the empty set's sum (which is 0) shouldn't be included, we subtract 1: [ a_{2000} - 1 = 2^{400} left[frac{1}{5} left(2^{1600} - 1right) + 1right] - 1. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{2^{400} left[frac{1}{5} left(2^{1600} - 1right) + 1right] - 1} ]"},{"prompt":"f vector overrightarrow{a}=left(x,2right), overrightarrow{b}=left(2,3right), overrightarrow{c}=left(2,4right), and overrightarrow{a} <span class=specialsymbol>∥</span> overrightarrow{c}, then the projection vector of overrightarrow{a} onto overrightarrow{b} is ( ).

Since overrightarrow{a}=left(x,2right) and overrightarrow{c}=left(2,-4right), parallelism implies that the components of these vectors are proportional, leading to the equation: [ frac{x}{2} = frac{2}{-4} ] Solving for x, we find: [ x = 2 times frac{-4}{2} = -1 ] Thus, the vector overrightarrow{a} becomes overrightarrow{a}=left(-1, 2right). We also know overrightarrow{b}=left(2, 3right). To find the projection of overrightarrow{a} onto overrightarrow{b}, we first normalize overrightarrow{b}: [ frac{overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{b}|} = frac{1}{sqrt{13}}(2, 3) ] To find the cosine of the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, we use the dot product and magnitudes of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}: [ cos ＜overrightarrow{a},overrightarrow{b}＞ = frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|} = frac{-2 + 6}{sqrt{5} times sqrt{13}} = frac{4}{sqrt{65}} ] Next, we calculate the projection vector of overrightarrow{a} onto overrightarrow{b}: [ |overrightarrow{a}|cos ＜overrightarrow{a},overrightarrow{b}＞ cdot frac{overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{b}|} = sqrt{5} times frac{4}{sqrt{65}} times frac{1}{sqrt{13}}(2, 3) = frac{4}{13}(2, 3) ] Simplifying this further, we get: [ = left(frac{8}{13}, frac{12}{13}right) ] Therefore, the projection vector of overrightarrow{a} onto overrightarrow{b} is boxed{left(frac{8}{13}, frac{12}{13}right)}, which corresponds to option boxed{A}."},{"prompt":"Chloe chooses a real number uniformly at random from the interval [ 0,3000 ].
