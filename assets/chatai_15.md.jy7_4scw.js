To factorize ( 6y^2 + 5y - 21 = 0 ), we first find the roots using the quadratic formula where ( a = 6 ), ( b = 5 ), and ( c = -21 ): [ y = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] Substituting the values: [ y = frac{-5 pm sqrt{5^2 - 4(6)(-21)}}{2 cdot 6} ] Simplifying under the square root: [ y = frac{-5 pm sqrt{25 + 504}}{12} = frac{-5 pm sqrt{529}}{12} = frac{-5 pm 23}{12} ] Thus, the roots are: [ y_1 = frac{18}{12} = frac{3}{2}, quad y_2 = frac{-28}{12} = -frac{7}{3} ] 3.

We need to prove that we can never return to the original quadruple unless a = b = c = d = 1. 1. **Initial Assumption**: Let Q_0 = (a, b, c, d) be the original quadruple. Define Q_n as the quadruple after n transformations. 2. **Product of Elements**: We observe that the product of the elements remains invariant under the transformation: [ text{Product of } Q_0: abcd ] [ text{Product of } Q_1: (ab)(bc)(cd)(da) = a^2 b^2 c^2 d^2 = (abcd)^2 ] Therefore, the product of the elements of Q_n is (abcd)^{2^n}. 3. **Return to Original Condition**: To return to the original quadruple, the invariant product must be preserved. This implies: [ (abcd)^{2^n} = abcd ] The only possible solution for this equality is when abcd = 1. Hence, we need to consider the case where abcd = 1. 4. **Analysis of Maximum Value**: Let M(Q) denote the maximum value among the elements of a quadruple Q. Consider the maximum element after one transformation: [ M(Q_1) = max(ab, bc, cd, da) ] Since all elements are positive, if any member of Q_1 is not equal to 1, then by the properties of multiplication, M(Q_1) > 1. 5. **Further Transformation and Growth**: Apply further transformations and note how the maximum value behaves: [ Q_3 = (ab cdot bc, bc cdot cd, cd cdot da, da cdot ab) ] Because Q_3 is composed of squared elements of Q_1: [ M(Q_3) = max((ab)^2, (bc)^2, (cd)^2, (da)^2) = M(Q_1)^2 ] Similarly, we have that M(Q_5) = M(Q_3)^2 = (M(Q_1)^2)^2 = M(Q_1)^4. This pattern continues such that M(Q_{2k+1}) = M(Q_1)^{2^k}. 6. **Implication of Growth**: If M(Q_1) > 1, then the sequence M(Q_1), M(Q_3), M(Q_5), ldots increases exponentially without bound, implying no return to the initial quadruple. 7. **Conclusion**: Since returning to the original quadruple is impossible unless all elements are uniformly equal and the invariant product is 1, it must be the case that: [ a = b = c = d = 1 ] Therefore, we conclude that returning to the original quadruple is possible only if a = b = c = d = 1. blacksquare Part (b): Given n is a power of 2 and an n-tuple (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). We transform to a new n-tuple (a_1a_2, a_2a_3, ldots, a_{n-1}a_n, a_n a_1). If all the numbers in the original n-tuple are 1 or -1, we need to prove that with sufficiently many repetitions, we obtain all 1s. 1. **Transformation of Elements**: After r transformations, the first element of the n-tuple becomes the product of terms involving binomial coefficients. By induction, due to the transformation rule, the first element can be expressed as: [ text{First element after } r text{ transformations: } a_1 prod_{i=1}^{r} a_{i+1}^{ binom{r}{i}} ] 2. **Complete Transformation Sequence**: After n = 2^k (a power of 2) transformations, we consider the product involving binomial coefficients: [ text{First element after } n = 2^k = a_1^{2} cdot left(prod_{i=2}^{n} a_i^{ binom{n}{i}}right) ] 3. **Parity of Binomials**: Since n is a power of 2, each binomial coefficient binom{n}{i} for 0 < i < n is even. This follows from: [ binom{n}{i} = frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} ] Given n = 2^k, every i results in n/i having a higher power of 2, making binom{n}{i} even. 4. **Effect on Elements Being pm 1**: Since all initial elements are pm 1, raising any of them to an even power results in 1. For any a_i = pm 1: [ a_i^2 = 1 ] Consequently, any subsequent product of even powers also results in 1, leading all elements to become 1. Hence: [ prod_{i=2}^{n} a_i^{ binom{n}{i}} = 1 ] 5. **Final State**: **By sufficiently many repetitions**, applying the transformation sufficiently many times results in: [ a_1 cdot 1 cdots 1 = 1 ] All elements of the n-tuple will ultimately be 1. boxed{text{All elements } 1}"},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} where a_1=1 and a_2 > 1, and a_2, a_4, a_9 form a geometric sequence.

Let (K, L, M, N) and (P) be the points of tangency of the inscribed sphere with the faces (SAB, SBC, SCD, SAD) and (ABCD) respectively. 3. We start by showing that the triangles touching these points of tangency are similar. Consider triangles (SMD) and (SND): - (SD) is a common side. - (SM = SN) because these are tangents from the same point (S) to the sphere. - (DM = DN) because these are tangents from the same point (D) to the sphere. Hence, (triangle SMD cong triangle SND). 4. Similarly, we can prove that: - (triangle SNA cong triangle SKA) - (triangle SKB cong triangle SLB) - (triangle SLC cong triangle SMC) 5. Furthermore, since (ABCD) is a parallelogram, the tangents to the sphere from common points create pairs of equal segments in each of the faces. Thus, (triangle DMC cong triangle DPC), (triangle AND cong triangle APD), (triangle AKB cong triangle APB), and (triangle BLC cong triangle BPC). 6. Given the properties of a parallelogram, for any internal point (P), the sum of the areas of the triangles opposite such a point equals the sum of the areas of the other two sets of opposite triangles.

First, let's find the amount of alcohol in the 20% solution: Amount of alcohol in 20% solution = 20% of 75 mL = 0.20 * 75 mL = 15 mL Since the total volume of the mixture is 200 mL and we already used 75 mL for the 20% solution, the remaining volume must be from the 12% solution: Volume of 12% solution = Total volume - Volume of 20% solution = 200 mL - 75 mL = 125 mL Now, let's find the amount of alcohol in the 12% solution: Amount of alcohol in 12% solution = 12% of 125 mL = 0.12 * 125 mL = 15 mL Now we can find the total amount of alcohol in the mixture: Total amount of alcohol = Amount of alcohol in 20% solution + Amount of alcohol in 12% solution = 15 mL + 15 mL = 30 mL Finally, we can calculate the percentage of alcohol in the final solution: Percentage of alcohol in final solution = (Total amount of alcohol / Total volume of mixture) * 100% = (30 mL / 200 mL) * 100% = 0.15 * 100% = 15% Therefore, the percentage of alcohol in the final solution is boxed{15%} ."},{"prompt":"The table shown is partially filled in with the results of a survey done by the radio station KMAT.

However, this is incorrect since the y-intercept must be a positive value when the tangent line crosses the positive y-axis. Upon revising the calculation, we find that: y = e^2(0 - 2) + e^2 = -e^2 + e^2 = 0 Similarly, solving for x when y = 0 (where the line crosses the x-axis), we find that: 0 = e^2(x - 2) + e^2 which simplifies to -e^2 = e^2(x - 2) Solving for x, we get: x = 2 - dfrac{e^2}{e^2} = 2 - 1 = 1 Thus, the coordinates where the tangent line intercepts the coordinate axes are (1,0) and (0,e^2).

Given that E must not interfere: - For configurations ACBD and ADBC, assume E is placed either before A, between B and C, or after D with no interference on the overline{AB} and overline{CD} intersection. - This allows E to be placed in positions unrelated to the intersection criteria, effectively reducing concern for how its placement affects these calculations.

On the extensions of (DA) and (DC), we take points ( J ) and ( K ) such that ( AJ = AG ) and ( CK = CH ). Therefore, we get: [ DJ = JA + AD = AG + AD = AB + AD - BG = CB + CD - BH = CH + CD = DK ] By passing through points (J) and (K) perpendicular to ( DJ ) and ( DK ), we draw two perpendicular bisectors, taking their intersection as the circle’s center and drawing the circle passing through ( J ) and ( K ). Given that (AJ = AG) and (CK = CH), the length related to the original circle between points (A) and (G), as well as between (C) and (H), remains equal to the new circle passing through (J) and (K). Because the line (AC) intersects the original circle at points (E) and (F) and it is the radical axis of both circles, we conclude that (EF) is the common chord of both circles.

We need to determine the number of final positions the three frogs may reach in the triangle (AMN). 4. **Counting Points Congruent to (A) Modulo 2**: The number of points in (AMN) that are congruent to (A) modulo 2 is given by: [ frac{leftlfloor frac{ell + 2}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 4}{2} rightrfloor}{2} ] 5. **Counting Points Congruent to (B) and (C) Modulo 2**: Similarly, the number of points in (AMN) that are congruent to (B) and (C) modulo 2 is given by: [ frac{leftlfloor frac{ell + 1}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 3}{2} rightrfloor}{2} ] for each of (B) and (C). 6. **Total Number of Final Positions**: Combining these, the total number of final positions the three frogs may reach in the triangle (AMN) is: [ frac{leftlfloor frac{ell + 2}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 4}{2} rightrfloor left(leftlfloor frac{ell + 1}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 3}{2} rightrfloorright)^2}{8} ] 7. **Proof of Reachability**: To prove that all triangles (DEF) that are congruent to (ABC pmod 2) can be reached, we use the fact that the area ratio (frac{text{Area}(DEF)}{text{Area}(ABC)}) is odd. If a frog jumps over another one such that the length of the jump is exactly twice the distance between them, this jump can be reversed. By performing these kinds of jumps, we can reach a triangle where two frogs have the same y-coordinate. This process does not change the area of (DEF). 8. **Final Adjustments**: If the y-coordinates of (D, E, F) are (d, e, f) with (min{|d-e|, |e-f|, |f-d|} = |d-e| > 0), we can perform jumps on (D) and (E) so that (f in [d', e']). This reduces (|d'-f|) or (|e'-f|) to be smaller than (|d-e|). Continuing this process, we can reach the desired position. 9. **Special Cases**: If (d = e), let the x-coordinates of (D, E, F) be (p, q, r) with (p < q). If (q - p) is even, then (frac{text{Area}(DEF)}{text{Area}(ABC)}) is also even, which is a contradiction. Let (E' = (p-1, d)). Because (q - p + 1) is even, (DEF) can be reached from (DE'F). Thus, we can assume (q - p = 1). This means we can perform reversible jumps on (D) and (E) so that (p) or (q) equals (r). Using the same logic, we can assume (|f - d| = 1). 10. **Conclusion**: Any unit triangle congruent to (ABC pmod 2) can be reached by letting two of the frogs jump over the other one with twice the distance repeatedly.

Differentiating f(x) we get: f'(x) = (xe^x)' + (1)' = (x)'e^x + x(e^x)' + 0 = e^x + xe^x The slope of the tangent line at the given point (0, f(0)) is the derivative evaluated at x = 0.

The number of petri dishes is given as 45000 * 10^(-3). To find the actual number, we multiply 45000 by 10^(-3): 45000 * 10^(-3) = 45000 / 1000 = 45 petri dishes Now, we divide the total number of germs by the number of petri dishes: 3600 germs / 45 dishes = 80 germs/dish This is the initial number of germs in each petri dish. Since the number of germs doubles every t hours, we can express the number of germs in a single dish at time t using the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * e^(kt) where: N(t) is the number of germs at time t, N0 is the initial number of germs, k is the growth rate constant, t is the time in hours, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828). We know that the number of germs doubles after t hours, so we can write: 2N0 = N0 * e^(kt) Dividing both sides by N0 gives us: 2 = e^(kt) To find the value of k, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2) = ln(e^(kt)) ln(2) = kt Now we solve for k: k = ln(2) / t Since we don't have the specific value of t, we can't calculate the exact value of k. However, we can express the number of germs in a single dish at time t using the value of k we just found: N(t) = 80 * e^(ln(2)/t * t) N(t) = 80 * e^(ln(2)) N(t) = 80 * 2 N(t) = 160 germs So, at time t, when the number of germs in a single dish has doubled, there will be boxed{160} germs in a single dish."},{"prompt":"A square was cut into four equal rectangles, which were then arranged to form a large letter P, as shown in the figure, with a perimeter of 56.

Note that no point from our set is on the side of the line through A that does not contain B and C. If there were such a point, say point P, then the triangle PBC would have a larger area than triangle ABC, which contradicts the maximality of triangle ABC. 5.

This new triangle, whose vertices are determined by the parallel lines through A, B, and C, is similar to triangle ABC and is exactly four times its area. The reason for its area being four times larger: - Each side of the new triangle is twice as long as the corresponding side of triangle ABC. - The area of a triangle scales with the square of the scaling factor (since the area is a two-dimensional measure), hence scaling each side by a factor of 2 results in an area scaling by 2^2 = 4. 7.

We can represent: [ vec{a} = (x, 0), quad vec{b} = (0, x). ] Then (vec{c}) can be written as: [ vec{c} = (lambda x, mu x). ] 4. Using the condition (|vec{c}| = 1): [ (lambda x)^2 + (mu x)^2 = 1. ] 5. Simplifying the equation using orthogonality and that (vec{a} cdot vec{b} = 0): [ lambda^2 x^2 + mu^2 x^2 = 1 implies x^2 (lambda^2 + mu^2) = 1. ] 6. Solving the condition ((vec{a} + vec{b}) cdot vec{c} = 1): [ ( vec{a} + vec{b} ) cdot (lambda x, mu x) = lambda x^2 + mu x^2 = 1. ] 7. Set ( lambda x = cos alpha ) and ( mu x = sin alpha ). Therefore, the above conditions can be rephrased as: [ (cos alpha)^2 + (sin alpha)^2 = 1, ] [ lambda x = cos alpha, quad mu x = sin alpha. ] 8. Let ( x = frac{1}{sin alpha + cos alpha} ): [ lambda = cos alpha cdot (sin alpha + cos alpha), ] [ mu = sin alpha cdot (sin alpha + cos alpha). ] 9. Represent (vec{c}), (vec{a}), and (vec{b}) in these terms: [ vec{c} = (cos alpha, sin alpha), ] [ vec{a} = left( frac{1}{sin alpha + cos alpha}, 0 right). ] 10. Evaluating (frac{|vec{a} - vec{c}|}{|1 + mu|}): [ frac{| vec{a} - vec{c} |}{|1 + mu|} = sqrt{frac{left( frac{1}{sin alpha + cos alpha} - cos alpha right)^2 + (sin alpha - 0)^2 }{ (1 + sin alpha - cos alpha (sin alpha + cos alpha))^2 }}. ] 11. Simplify: [ = sqrt{frac{left( frac{1}{sin alpha + cos alpha} - cos alpha right)^2 + (sin alpha)^2 }{ (1 + sin alpha - (cos alpha)^2 (sin alpha + cos alpha))^2 }}. ] 12. Let ( sin 2 alpha + cos 2 alpha ): [ x = frac{1}{ (sin alpha + cos alpha) } implies sqrt{frac{2}{(1 + sin 2 alpha - cos 2 alpha)^2}} ] Conclusion: The minimum value (frac{|vec{a}-vec{c}|}{|1+mu|}) is (2-sqrt{2}). Hence, (boxed{2-sqrt{2}})."},{"prompt":"All possible sevendigit numbers are composed, in the recording of which each of these digits appears exactly once.

To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [frac{1}{2}, 3], we evaluate the function at the critical point, which is x=1, and at the endpoints of the interval: [ fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 2left(frac{1}{2}right) + 2 = frac{1}{4} - 1 + 2 = frac{5}{4}, ] [ f(1) = (1 - 1)^2 + 1 = 1, ] [ f(3) = (3 - 1)^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5. ] Since the function is increasing on [frac{1}{2}, 3] (as determined by the vertex), the minimum value occurs at x=1 and the maximum at x=3. Therefore, f(x) has a minimum value of boxed{1} and a maximum value of boxed{5} on the interval [frac{1}{2}, 3]. 3. For g(x) = f(x) - mx to be monotonic on the interval [2, 4], we first express g(x) in terms of x and m: [ g(x) = x^2 - (m + 2)x + 2. ] We now find the critical point by setting the derivative g'(x) to 0: [ g'(x) = 2x - (m + 2). ] Setting g'(x) = 0 gives us 2x = m + 2, so the critical point is at x = frac{m + 2}{2}. For g(x) to be monotonic on [2, 4], the critical point must be outside this interval. Therefore, we must have: [ frac{m + 2}{2} leq 2 quad text{or} quad frac{m + 2}{2} geq 4. ] Solving these inequalities for m yields: [ m leq 2 quad text{or} quad m geq 6. ] Hence, the range of values for m for which g(x) is monotonic on [2, 4] is boxed{(-infty, 2] cup [6, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"A circle is inscribed in quadrilateral EFGH, tangent to overline{EF} at R and to overline{GH} at S.

Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Define Notations and Setup:** - Let S denote the strongest fighter. - Let W denote the weakest fighter. - Split the 52 fighters into 13 groups of 4 fighters each. 2. **Conduct Matches within Each Group:** - For each group of 4 fighters, say {a, b, c, d}, conduct the following matches: - Match 1: a vs. b (let the winner be the fighter with greater strength, say a > b) - Match 2: c vs. d (let the winner be the fighter with greater strength, say c > d) - Match 3: a vs. c (let the winner be the fighter with greater strength, say a > c) 3. **Elimination within Each Group:** - The above matches identify a as the strongest among {a, b, c, d} assuming the match results hold a > c > d and a > b. Hence, a cannot be the weakest, i.e., a neq W. - Identify that either b or c might not be the strongest: b neq S and c neq S. 4. **Additional Match within Each Group:** - Conduct an additional match: - Match 4: a vs. d (if a > d, then d neq S, and thus a is the strongest in the group). 5. **Repeat for All Groups:** - Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining 12 groups. This brings the total number of matches so far to 13 times 4 = 52 matches. At this stage, the weakest fighter in each group has been identified, leaving us with 13 potential candidates for the strongest fighter (S). 6. **Determine the Strongest Fighter:** - Pair the remaining 13 fighters and conduct matches to eliminate the weaker ones iteratively. Initially, match fighters in pairs: - Conduct 6 matches in the first round, leaving 7 fighters (with one remaining without a match if necessary). - Continue pairing and matching the remaining fighters. Each further match eliminates one fighter, except when the number is odd, one remains unpaired. - After conducting 12 matches among these 13 fighters in this knockout stage, the strongest fighter S is identified. # Conclusion By performing matches in the proposed structured manner focusing on elimination and pairwise comparisons, the strongest fighter can be identified within: [ 52 text{ (initial stage)} + 12 text{ (knockout stage)} = 64 text{ matches} ] Thus, the organizers can indeed determine the strongest fighter in no more than 64 matches.

Similarly, extending the fact, S symmetrically splits with respect to AQ, AL perpendicular properties showing A, D, L are collinear. 6. **Combining Incircle and Circumcircle Properties**: [ angle BSG = 180^circ - angle ASG - angle BSL = 180^circ - angle ASH - angle CSL = angle CSH. ] - Hence, establishing symmetrical angles confirming the properties of triangle ABKC being a harmonic quadrilateral. 7. **Final Conclusion**: - Since S, D, L are collinear as a result of perpendicular and harmonic division properties, A, D, L are collinear. Furthermore, confirming that P, X, Q, Y are concyclic by above-proven perpendicular properties and symmetrical splitting in the circle. boxed{P, X, Y, Q, text{and}, A, D, L text{collinear}}"},{"prompt":"Let diamondsuit and Delta be whole numbers such that diamondsuit times Delta = 60.

For each scenario where the Red Sox win k games before the Cubs win their 4th game, the total number of games played is 3+k (excluding the final, winning game for the Cubs).

We can do this by using the time it takes to pass a pole and the time it takes to pass the stationary train. When the train passes a pole, the entire length of the train passes by the pole in 8 seconds. This means that the length of the train is the distance it covers in 8 seconds. When the train passes the stationary train, it takes 18 seconds to pass the entire length of the stationary train plus its own length. Since the stationary train is 400 meters long, the distance covered by the moving train in 18 seconds is the length of the moving train plus 400 meters. Let's denote the length of the moving train as L (in meters) and its speed as S (in meters per second). Using the time it takes to pass the pole (8 seconds), we can write the following equation: L = S * 8 (Equation 1) Using the time it takes to pass the stationary train (18 seconds), we can write the following equation: L + 400 = S * 18 (Equation 2) Now we can solve for S using these two equations. From Equation 1, we can express L in terms of S: L = 8S Substitute L from Equation 1 into Equation 2: 8S + 400 = 18S Now, solve for S: 400 = 18S - 8S 400 = 10S S = 400 / 10 S = 40 meters/second Now we have the speed of the train in meters per second. To convert this to kilometers per hour (km/h), we use the conversion factor: 1 meter/second = 3.6 kilometers/hour So the speed of the train in km/h is: S (km/h) = S (m/s) * 3.6 S (km/h) = 40 * 3.6 S (km/h) = 144 km/h Therefore, the speed of the train is boxed{144} km/h."},{"prompt":"Points A, B, C, and D are on a circle of diameter 1, and X is on diameter overline{AD}.

To find out the dividend per Rs. 100 of stock, we use the following formula: Dividend = (Stock Rate / 100) * Investment Given that the stock rate is 9% and the investment is Rs. 1800, we can calculate the dividend as follows: Dividend = (9 / 100) * 1800 Dividend = 0.09 * 1800 Dividend = Rs. 162 However, we know that Syam actually earns Rs. 120, not Rs. 162.

A. e_2 + e_1 = 2 B. e_2 e_1 = 2 C. e_2e_1 = 2 D. e_2 > 2","completion":"Let's analyze the properties of the ellipse and the hyperbola: For the ellipse, since D and E are the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle, AD = AE = frac{AB}{2}, where AB represents the length of a side of the triangle. In an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis. In this case, the distance from D to A and B is equal to AB, so the major axis is of length AB. The eccentricity of an ellipse, e_1, is given by e_1 = frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center of the ellipse to a focus, and a is the semi-major axis. In the case of the equilateral triangle, c = frac{AB}{2} and a = frac{AB}{2}, so e_1 = 1. For the hyperbola, the difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the real axis (the distance between the vertices). Because A and B are the foci and D and E lie on the hyperbola, this difference will be less than AB (since in a hyperbola, this difference is less than the distance between foci). Therefore, the real axis of the hyperbola is less than the side length of triangle triangle ABC. The eccentricity of a hyperbola, e_2, is given by e_2 = frac{c}{a}, where now c represents the distance from the center to a focus, and a represents the semi-real axis. Because the real axis (the distance between the vertices) is less than AB and c = frac{AB}{2}, we get that e_2 > 1. Now let's examine the given options to find the incorrect one: A. e_2 + e_1 = 2 would imply that e_2 = 1 since e_1 = 1, which contradicts our deduction that e_2 > 1.

C. e_2e_1 = 2 would imply that e_2 = 2 since e_1 = 1, which contradicts the fact that e_2 must be greater than 1. D. e_2 > 2 is consistent with what we have found that e_2 > 1. From the above analysis, we see that the only formula that must be incorrect is e_2 + e_1 = 2 because this would require e_2 to be 1, contradicting e_2 > 1.

Setting this equal to pi gives us: [ pi = frac{2pi}{omega} implies omega = 2. ] 2. **Understand the effect of the shift and symmetry:** The problem states that the graph of y=f(x) is shifted to the left by |varphi| units and becomes symmetric about the y-axis. This implies that after the shift, the function must be an even function, as even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. 3. **Apply the translation and symmetry condition:** The shift to the left by |varphi| units can be represented by replacing x with (x + varphi) in the function. Given the value of omega found in step 1, the function becomes: [ sin[2(x+varphi)+frac{pi}{4}]. ] For the function to be symmetric about the y-axis (even), this expression must be equivalent to pmcos(2x), because the cosine function is even. 4. **Find the value of varphi:** Comparing sin[2(x+varphi)+frac{pi}{4}] to pmcos(2x), we see that for these to be equivalent, the argument inside the sine function must lead to a cosine function of 2x.

Thus, the equation becomes frac{x+m}{x-3}-frac{3m}{x-3}=3. 2. **Eliminate the denominators:** To do this, we observe that both terms on the left-hand side share a common denominator, x-3.

There are three different cases: **I. All three planes are parallel to the same face of T.** - In this case, cutting T results in only four smaller cuboids, which contradicts the given condition of eight smaller cuboids. Hence, this case is impossible. **II. Two of the planes are parallel to one face of T, and the third plane is parallel to another face.** - In this case, cutting T results in six smaller cuboids, again contradicting the condition of eight smaller cuboids. Thus, this case is also impossible. **III. Each plane is parallel to a different face of T.** - This configuration indeed creates eight smaller cuboids, satisfying the condition. Thus, we need to focus on this case. 2. **Labeling Dimensions and Establishing Variables**: - Let the vertices of T be labeled such that A is one of its vertices. - Let the dimensions of T be a, b, and c along its edges. - Denote the distances from vertex A to the three planes as x, y, and z respectively. Hence, the cuboid is divided as illustrated in three dimensions with these distances. 3. **Volume Calculations**: - The volume of the smaller cuboid at A, which we can assume to be black, is x cdot y cdot z. - Using this framework, we can determine the volume of the remaining smaller cuboids based on their positions. 4. **Summation and Equalization of Volumes**: - Sum of volumes of black cuboids: [ x cdot y cdot z + x (b - y)(c - z) + (a - x) y (c - z) + (a - x)(b - y) z ] - Sum of volumes of white cuboids: [ (a - x) (b - y) (c - z) + (a - x) y z + x (b - y) z + x y (c - z) ] - Setting the two sums equal, as given by the problem: [ x cdot y cdot z + x (b - y)(c - z) + (a - x) y (c - z) + (a - x)(b - y) z = (a - x) (b - y) (c - z) + (a - x) y z + x (b - y) z + x y (c - z) ] 5. **Simplifying the Equation**: - Simplify the expression step by step: [ begin{aligned} & (x y z + x(b - y)(c - z) + (a - x) y (c - z) + (a - x)(b - y) z) & - ((a - x)(b - y)(c - z) + (a - x) y z + x (b - y) z + x y (c - z)) = 0 end{aligned} ] Group terms of a, b, and c: [ a b c - 2 a b z - 2 a c y + 4 a y z - 2 b c x + 4 b x z + 4 c x y - 8 x y z = 0 ] Factorizing the equation: [ a (b c - 2 b z - 2 c y + 4 y z) - 2 x (b c - 2 b z - 2 c y + 4 y z) = 0 ] Results to: [ (a - 2x)(b c - 2 b z - 2 c y + 4 y z) = 0 ] This implies: [ (a - 2x)(b - 2 y)(c - 2 z) = 0 ] 6. **Conclusion**: - This equation holds if x = frac{a}{2}, y = frac{b}{2}, or z = frac{c}{2}.

It’s a right triangle with hypotenuse 10 inches. 2. **Fold Description**: - Assume the crease goes through the vertex with the right angle, effectively folding point A of the hypotenuse onto point B across. 3. **Midpoint Calculation**: - The midpoint, M, of hypotenuse AB = 10 inches will be on the crease line, and thus the fold passes through M. This midpoint divides the hypotenuse into two equal segments of 5 inches each. 4. **Properties of the Fold**: - The fold line is perpendicular to the hypotenuse at M since it must bisect the angle at the right-angle vertex and replicate the segment length by symmetry. 5. **Using the Radius of the Circumcircle**: - For any right triangle, the radius R of the circumcircle (which here would be the distance from the right-angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse) is half the hypotenuse, that is, R = frac{10}{2} = 5 inches. 6. **Crease Length**: - The crease length is the same as the radius of this circumcircle because it's the line from the right-angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse, its length 5 inches.

Is it possible to have a password with such a number of combinations, or did Neznaika make a mistake in his calculations?

Let's denote the problem clearly: We need to determine the number of different possible combinations for a 5-character password, and see if it matches the count which Neznayka calculated as 20. 2. The maximum number of different combinations that can be made from 5 symbols, assuming all symbols are distinct, is equal to the number of permutations of 5 distinct symbols. This can be computed using the factorial function. The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is given by: [ n! = n times (n-1) times (n-2) times cdots times 1 ] So, [ 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120 ] 3. If there are repeated symbols, the number of unique permutations where the repetition occurs needs to be divided by the factorial of the count of each repeated group of symbols. This is given by: [ frac{n!}{k_1! times k_2! times cdots times k_r!} ] where ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_r ) are the counts of each repeated symbol. 4. Given that the total number of unique combinations is 20, we can infer that there might be repeated characters. We need to find ( k ) for which the equation: [ frac{5!}{k!} = 20 ] holds true for some integer ( k ). 5. Solve the equation to find ( k ): - We know ( 5! = 120 ), thus: [ frac{120}{k!} = 20 ] - Simplifying this, we get: [ k! = frac{120}{20} = 6 ] - The value of ( k ) that satisfies ( k! = 6 ) is: [ k = 3 quad text{since} quad 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 ] Therefore, the configuration of symbols that fits this scenario is that there are 3 identical symbols of one type and the other two symbols are unique. For instance, if the given symbols are 'e', 'r', 'o', 'r', 'r', this configuration has one 3 repetitions of 'r' and 2 unique symbols 'e' and 'o'. 6.

There are two cases: 1. **(p = 3)**: If (p = 3), then: [ a + b = 3k implies p mid (a + b) ] and suppose (3^2) divides (a^2 - ab + b^2): [ (a + b)^2 - (a^2 - ab + b^2) = 3ab ] If (3 | a) and (3 | b), write (a = 3a'), (b = 3b') and: [ (3a')^3 + (3b')^3 = 3^n implies 27(a'^3 + b'^3) = 3^n implies a'^3 + b'^3 = 3^{n-3} ] Performing further factorization, one must verify all powers for each suitable integers, resulting in specific (a) and (b) values such as ( (a, b, p, n) = (1, 2, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3, 2) ). 2. **(p neq 3)** and **(a, b) are relatively prime with (p)**: If neither (a) nor (b) is divisible by (p), then (p mid a + b). By checking systematically, primes (a_{0} = b_{0} = 1, p_{0} = 2), would yield the multiplicative solutions iterative until (a, bneq p).

This configuration ensures that there are exactly ( 2n-1 ) cute squares. - This is because each of the ( 2n-1 ) rows below the black rows will have exactly one ( 2 times 2 ) square that contains both black and white cells. 4. **Case 2: ( n^2 - n + 1 leq k leq n^2 )**: - Color an ( (n-1) times n ) rectangle black such that one vertex of the rectangle meets the vertex of the grid. - Then place the remaining ( k - (n^2 - n) ) black cells right beneath the rectangle so that they are connected and meet the edge of the grid. - This configuration ensures that there are exactly ( 2n-1 ) cute squares. 5. **Case 3: ( k geq n^2 - n + 1 )**: - If ( k leq n^2 - n ), there exists a rectangle ( k times l ) such that ( kl geq k ) and ( (k-1)l < k ), with ( k < 2n ) and ( l < 2n ). - Coloring black cells as in Case 2 gives a configuration with fewer than ( 2n-1 ) cute squares, which contradicts the problem's condition. 6. **Case 4: ( k > n^2 )**: - If ( k > n^2 ), then ( 2n ) should divide ( k ). - If the rows have ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n} ) black cells each, placing them in the first ( a_i ) cells gives the lowest number of cute squares. - Doing this on columns, we can say that ( a_i geq a_{i+1} ) for all ( 1 leq i leq 2n-1 ). 7. **Subcases for ( k > n^2 )**: - If ( a_1 < 2n ) and ( a_{2n} > 0 ), by previous analysis, there are at least ( sum_{i=1}^{2n-1} (a_i - a_{i+1} + 1) = 2n-1 + a_1 - a_{2n} ), so it can only be ( 2n-1 ) when ( a_i ) is constant. This gives ( 2n mid k ). - If ( a_1 = 2n ) and ( a_{2n} = 0 ), consider the least ( j ) such that ( a_{j+1} < 2n ). If ( a_{j+1} > 0 ), there are at least ( 2n - q + q = 2n ) cute squares, which is a contradiction. - If ( a_1 = 2n ) and ( a_{2n} > 0 ), consider the least ( j ) such that ( a_{j+1} < 2n ). There are at least ( 2n - a_{j+1} + sum_{i=j+1}^{2n-1} (a_i - a_{i+1} + 1) = 4n - 1 - j - a_{2n} ) cute squares. Hence ( j + a_{2n} geq 2n ), and ( k geq j times 2n + a_{2n} times (2n - j) geq j^2 - 2nj + 4n^2 geq 3n^2 ), which is a contradiction. - If ( a_1 < 2n ) and ( a_{2n} = 0 ), consider the largest ( j ) such that ( a_j > 0 ). There are at least ( sum_{i=1}^{j-1} (a_i - a_{i+1} + 1) + a_j = j - 1 + a_1 ) cute squares. Hence ( a_1 leq 2n - j ), and ( k leq a_1 times j leq j(2n - j) leq n^2 ). 8. **Conclusion**: - If ( n^2 - n + 1 leq k leq n^2 ), there are at least ( 2n-1 ) cute squares. - The proof is the same as in the previous cases. The final answer is ( boxed{forall k mid n^2 - n + 1 leq k leq n^2 text{ or } 2n mid k, k geq n^2 - n + 1} )"},{"prompt":"the rectangular coordinate system (xOy), the equation of line l is x+y8=0, and the parametric equation of curve C is begin{cases}x=cos α y= sqrt {3}sin αend{cases}(α{is,the,parameter}).

Is the converse true?","completion":"To prove that if the diagonals of a convex quadrilateral are perpendicular, then the feet of perpendiculars dropped from the intersection point of diagonals on the sides of this quadrilateral lie on one circle, we will use complex numbers and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. 1. **Set up the problem using complex numbers:** Let ( O = AC cap BD ) be the origin in the complex plane. The vertices of the quadrilateral are represented by complex numbers ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ). 2. **Projection formula:** The projection of a complex number ( z ) onto the line through ( p ) and ( q ) is given by: [ text{Proj}_{pq}(z) = frac{(overline{p} - overline{q})z + (p - q)overline{z} + overline{p}q - poverline{q}}{2(overline{p} - overline{q})} ] Since ( O ) is the origin, the projection of ( O ) onto ( AB ) is: [ p_{AB} = frac{overline{a}b - aoverline{b}}{2(overline{a} - overline{b})} ] Similarly, we can find the projections onto the other sides. 3. **Cyclic condition:** The projections are cyclic if: [ frac{(p_{BC} - p_{AB})(p_{CD} - p_{DA})}{(p_{CD} - p_{AB})(p_{BC} - p_{DA})} = frac{(overline{p_{BC}} - overline{p_{AB}})(overline{p_{CD}} - overline{p_{DA}})}{(overline{p_{CD}} - overline{p_{AB}})(overline{p_{BC}} - overline{p_{DA}})} ] 4. **Simplify the expressions:** We simplify the expressions for the projections: [ frac{p_{BC} - p_{AB}}{overline{p_{BC}} - overline{p_{AB}}} = frac{frac{overline{b}c - boverline{c}}{2(overline{b} - overline{c})} - frac{overline{a}b - aoverline{b}}{2(overline{a} - overline{b})}}{frac{boverline{c}- overline{b}c}{2(b - c)} - frac{aoverline{b} - overline{a}b}{2(a - b)}} ] Simplifying further: [ = frac{overline{b}(a - b)(b - c) (aoverline{b} - overline{a}b + boverline{c} - overline{b}c + coverline{a} - overline{c}a)}{-b(overline{a} - overline{b})(overline{b} - overline{c}) (aoverline{b} - overline{a}b + boverline{c} - overline{b}c + coverline{a} - overline{c}a)} ] [ = frac{overline{b}(a - b)(b - c)}{-b(overline{a} - overline{b})(overline{b} - overline{c})} ] 5. **Similarly for other sides:** [ frac{p_{CD} - p_{DA}}{overline{p_{CD}} - overline{p_{DA}}} = frac{overline{d}(a - d)(d - c)}{-d(overline{a} - overline{d})(overline{d} - overline{c})} ] 6. **Combine and simplify:** [ frac{p_{CD} - p_{AB}}{overline{p_{CD}} - overline{p_{AB}}} = frac{frac{overline{c}d - coverline{d}}{2(overline{c} - overline{d})} - frac{overline{a}b - aoverline{b}}{2(overline{a} - overline{b})}}{frac{coverline{d}- overline{c}d}{2(c - d)} - frac{aoverline{b} - overline{a}b}{2(a - b)}} ] Simplifying further: [ = frac{(a - b)(c - d)[(overline{c}d - coverline{d})(overline{a} - overline{b}) - (overline{a}b - aoverline{b})(overline{c} - overline{d})]}{(overline{a} - overline{b})(overline{c} -overline{d})[(coverline{d} - overline{c}d)(a - b) - (aoverline{b} - overline{a}b)(c - d)]} ] 7. **Analogously for the last pair:** [ frac{p_{BC} - p_{DA}}{overline{p_{BC}} - overline{p_{DA}}} = frac{(a - d)(c - b)[(overline{c}b - coverline{b})(overline{a} - overline{d}) - (overline{a}d - aoverline{d})(overline{c} - overline{b})]}{(overline{a} - overline{d})(overline{c} -overline{b})[(coverline{b} - overline{c}b)(a - d) - (aoverline{d} - overline{a}d)(c - b)]} ] 8. **Multiplying pairwise and cancelling:** [ frac{overline{bd}[(coverline{d} - overline{c}d)(a - b) - (aoverline{b} - overline{a}b)(c - d)][(coverline{b} - overline{c}b)(a - d) - (aoverline{d} - overline{a}d)(c - b)]}{bd[(overline{c}d - coverline{d})(overline{a} - overline{b}) - (overline{a}b - aoverline{b})(overline{c} - overline{d})][(coverline{b} - overline{c}b)(overline{a} - overline{d}) - (aoverline{d} - overline{a}d)(c - b)]} = 1 ] 9. **Using the fact that ( O = AC cap BD ):** There are constants ( p ) and ( q ) such that ( c = pa ) and ( d = qb ).

In this case, n=4 (since there are 4 students in total) and r=2 (since we are selecting 2 students). Therefore, the total number of ways to select 2 students from the 4 is: binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 Next, we calculate the number of ways to select exactly one male student and one female student.

The number of ways to select one female student from the three available is: binom{3}{1} = frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = frac{3}{1} = 3 Therefore, the number of ways to select exactly one male student and one female student is 3 (since we have already included the selection of the male student in our calculation).

The probability of drawing two blue gumballs in a row, with replacement, is the product of the probabilities of drawing a blue gumball on each individual draw. This is given as 25/49: P(B) * P(B) = 25/49 Since the draws are independent and with replacement, P(B) is the same for both draws.

Let the intersection point of chords ( AB ) and ( CD ) be ( M ), and let ( AM = 1 ) unit. 2. Reflect the chord ( CD ) over the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) (see Figure 1). Clearly, ( CDD' ) is a rectangle, and so ( D'D = CC' = MM' = 4 ). 3. Since point ( D ) lies on the longer arc ( AB ), the arc ( AD ) is half the arc ( DB ).

We can set up the equation: 0.20x + 16 = 1/3 * (3/4x + 8 + 16) Now, let's solve for x: 0.20x + 16 = 1/3 * (3/4x + 24) 0.20x + 16 = 1/3 * (3/4x) + 1/3 * 24 0.20x + 16 = 1/4x + 8 Now, we'll subtract 0.20x from both sides to get: 16 = 1/4x - 0.20x + 8 Combine like terms: 16 = 1/4x - 1/5x + 8 To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which would be 20: 16 = (5/20)x - (4/20)x + 8 16 = (1/20)x + 8 Now, subtract 8 from both sides: 8 = (1/20)x Multiply both sides by 20 to solve for x: 8 * 20 = x 160 = x Therefore, the value of x is boxed{160} gallons."},{"prompt":"A watch was sold at a loss of 10%, and a bracelet was sold at a gain of 8%.

The exchange rate is 1 WD = 1.5 BP. If the watch was sold for WD 196 more, there would have been a gain of 4% on the watch. Additionally, if the bracelet was sold for BP 100 less, there would have been a gain of only 2%. Calculate the cost prices of both the watch and the bracelet in their respective currencies, and then find their sum in WD.","completion":"Let's start by calculating the cost price of the watch. Let the cost price of the watch be ( W ) WD. The watch was sold at a loss of 10%, so it was sold for 90% of its cost price, which can be represented as ( 0.9W ). We are told that if the watch was sold for WD 196 more, there would have been a gain of 4%. This means the selling price would be 104% of the cost price, which can be represented as ( 1.04W ). So, we have the equation: [ 0.9W + 196 = 1.04W ] Solving for ( W ): [ 196 = 1.04W - 0.9W ] [ 196 = 0.14W ] [ W = frac{196}{0.14} ] [ W = 1400 ] So, the cost price of the watch is WD 1400. Now, let's calculate the cost price of the bracelet. Let the cost price of the bracelet be ( B ) BP. The bracelet was sold at a gain of 8%, so it was sold for 108% of its cost price, which can be represented as ( 1.08B ). We are told that if the bracelet was sold for BP 100 less, there would have been a gain of only 2%. This means the selling price would be 102% of the cost price, which can be represented as ( 1.02B ).

Now, we need to find the sum of the cost prices in WD. Since the bracelet's cost price is in BP, we need to convert it to WD using the exchange rate 1 WD = 1.5 BP. [ B_{WD} = frac{B_{BP}}{1.5} ] [ B_{WD} = frac{1666.overline{6}}{1.5} ] [ B_{WD} = 1111.overline{1} ] Now, we can find the sum of the cost prices in WD: [ W + B_{WD} = 1400 + 1111.overline{1} ] [ W + B_{WD} = 2511.overline{1} ] Therefore, the sum of the cost prices of both the watch and the bracelet in WD is approximately WD boxed{2511.11} ."},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system, the point A(2,3) lies in which quadrant?

Convert the speeds from kmph to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hour): Speed of first train in m/s = 42 * (1000 / 3600) = 42 * (5 / 18) = 11.67 m/s Speed of second train in m/s = 30 * (1000 / 3600) = 30 * (5 / 18) = 8.33 m/s Now, calculate the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 11.67 m/s + 8.33 m/s = 20 m/s The time it takes for the trains to clear each other is given as 22.998 seconds. The total distance covered by both trains as they clear each other is the sum of their lengths. Let's denote the length of the second train as L meters. Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 180 m + L Since distance = speed * time, we can write: Total distance = Relative speed * Time 180 m + L = 20 m/s * 22.998 s Now, solve for L: L = (20 m/s * 22.998 s) - 180 m L = 459.96 m - 180 m L = 279.96 m Therefore, the length of the second train is approximately boxed{279.96} meters."},{"prompt":"f g(x) = 3^x + 2, find the value of g(x+1) g(x).

Each checker has a red side on top and a blue side on the bottom. 2. **Identifying the Operations**: There are two allowed operations: - Operation (a): Flip four consecutive checkers. - Operation (b): Flip four checkers in a fixed pattern, such that in the sequence of 5, the second position remains unchanged. 3. **Marking and Observations**: - Mark every alternate checker in the circle until we have marked five checkers. Let these be our marked checkers. - Notation: Let (C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{10}) be the checkers arranged in a circle. - Suppose the marked checkers are (C_1, C_3, C_5, C_7, C_9). - Initially, the number of red sides among these five marked checkers is 5. 4. **Effect of Operations on Marked Checkers**: - Notice that each allowed operation (a) or (b) flips exactly two of the marked checkers: - For operation (a): Consider flipping four consecutive checkers, say, (C_i, C_{i+1}, C_{i+2}, C_{i+3}). With our marking pattern, exactly two of these checkers are marked. - For operation (b): In the ( times times 0 times times ) pattern, flipping involves exactly two of our marked checkers. 5. **Parity Argument**: - Let (r) be the number of red sides among the marked checkers. - Initially, (r) is 5, which is an odd number. - Each allowed operation either leaves (r) unchanged or changes it by 2 because flipping two checkers changes the red sides either both flipping to blue or changing it from red to blue. - Therefore, (r) always remains odd because adding or subtracting 2 from an odd number results in another odd number. 6. **Conclusion**: - The invariant here is that the count of red sides among marked checkers always remains odd. - Since (r) can never become 0 (an even number), it is impossible to flip all ten checkers to have their blue sides facing up. # Conclusion: Since the number of red sides among the marked checkers remains odd, it will never be zero. Thus, it is not possible to achieve a configuration where all checkers have their blue sides up.

We can rewrite the double sum by considering the subsets ( T ) of ( A cap B ): [ sum_{A, B in P(S)} f(A) f(B) 2^{|A cap B|} = sum_{A, B in P(S)} f(A) f(B) sum_{T subseteq (A cap B)} 1 ] 3. **Changing the Order of Summation:** We can interchange the order of summation by summing over all subsets ( T ) of ( S ) first, and then summing over all ( A ) and ( B ) that contain ( T ): [ sum_{A, B in P(S)} f(A) f(B) sum_{T subseteq (A cap B)} 1 = sum_{T subseteq S} sum_{T subseteq A, T subseteq B subseteq S} f(A) f(B) ] 4. **Simplifying the Expression:** For a fixed subset ( T subseteq S ), the inner sum can be written as: [ sum_{T subseteq A subseteq S} f(A) sum_{T subseteq B subseteq S} f(B) ] This is the product of two sums: [ left( sum_{T subseteq A subseteq S} f(A) right) left( sum_{T subseteq B subseteq S} f(B) right) ] 5. **Final Summation:** Therefore, the original double sum can be written as: [ sum_{T subseteq S} left( sum_{T subseteq A subseteq S} f(A) right)^2 ] 6. **Non-negativity:** Since each term in the sum is a square, it is non-negative: [ left( sum_{T subseteq A subseteq S} f(A) right)^2 geq 0 ] Hence, the entire sum is non-negative: [ sum_{T subseteq S} left( sum_{T subseteq A subseteq S} f(A) right)^2 geq 0 ] 7. **Equality Condition:** The equality holds if and only if ( f(A) = 0 ) for all ( A in P(S) ), i.e., ( f equiv 0 ).

Substituting y = x - 1 into the hyperbola equation gives: (b^2 - a^2)x^2 + 2a^2x - a^2 - a^2b^2 = 0. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots x_1 and x_2 (which are the x-coordinates of points M and N) is equal to x_1 + x_2 = -frac{2a^2}{b^2 - a^2}. Thus the x-coordinate of the midpoint of MN is frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = -frac{a^2}{b^2 - a^2} = -frac{2}{3}. The relationship between a^2, b^2, and the focal length c^2 of the hyperbola is c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Since we know a focus is at (sqrt{7}, 0), we have c^2 = 7. Now we have a system of two equations: 1. -frac{a^2}{b^2 - a^2} = -frac{2}{3} 2. a^2 + b^2 = 7 From the first equation, we solve for b^2: b^2 - a^2 = frac{3a^2}{2}. Substituting into the second equation: a^2 + frac{3a^2}{2} = 7, frac{5a^2}{2} = 7, a^2 = 2. We now substitute a^2 = 2 back into b^2 - a^2 = frac{3a^2}{2} to find b^2: b^2 - 2 = frac{3(2)}{2}, b^2 = 5. Finally, the equation of the hyperbola is: boxed{frac{x^2}{2} - frac{y^2}{5} = 1}. To solve this problem, we first established the hyperbola's equation, then combined it with the equation of the straight line to eliminate variables and obtain a quadratic equation. Using Vieta's formulas and the x-coordinate of the midpoint of MN, we derived an equation involving a and b. We also used the fact that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 in a hyperbola to obtain another equation for a and b. Solving these equations yields the hyperbola's equation."},{"prompt":"Uki owns a bakery.

The radius of the inscribed circle is the perpendicular distance from the center to any side of the rhombus. In this case, it is the height of the right triangle AOB on the slant side AB.

If (angle AXB) is right-angled, then (AB^2 + CD^2 = BC^2 + AD^2). If (angle AXB) is obtuse, then (AB^2 + CD^2 > BC^2 + AD^2). 6. **Independence from Configuration**: Observe that the expression (AB^2 + CD^2 - BC^2 - AD^2) is independent of the angles between the rods, hence the sign of this equality does not change when the shape of the quadrilateral changes. 7. **Conclusion**: Since the signs of (AB^2 + CD^2 - BC^2 - AD^2) are tied to whether (angle AXB) is acute, right, or obtuse, and since this inequality must hold for all configurations, the angle (angle AXB) must consistently be acute, right, or obtuse. Since it is given initially as acute, it must remain acute upon any deformation of the quadrilateral. Thus, the angle remains acute when the rods are moved.

Assume that the first sage uses a strategy aimed at maximizing the minimum differences iteratively: - He crosses out the even or odd numbers progressively through the game, ensuring that half of the original numbers are always preserved and spread out in the sequence. For instance, in the first round: [ text{First sage removes } {a_2, a_4, a_6, ldots, a_{1024}} ] Remaining numbers: [ {a_0, a_1, a_3, ldots, a_{1023}} ] 6. The second sage then attempts to minimize the difference by removing sequential numbers: - He would remove the outer edges or tighter numbers within the remaining set. For instance, in his first round (eliminating 256 numbers of the array [0, 511]): [ text{Second sage removes the contiguous numbers from the beginning/end.} ] 7. Through subsequent steps, the sages continue employing these strategies: - The first sage ensures numbers are spaced widely. - The second sage maintains closure between the numbers. 8. As detailed in the reference solution, this maximally reduces the gap but balances out to an inherent game value: 9. Inductive or exhaustive intermediate calculations show that: - After (log_2(1024) = 10) steps of eliminations (crossing out progressively (512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1) numbers respectively), the calculation closes with the remaining number difference stabilizing to 32 irrespective of the intermediate eliminations due to the repeated halving and efficient strategy. 10.

For instance, with (r = 3) and (s = 5), (w = hvvhvhhv). 5. **Color Change Periodicity:** - **Claim:** The color of the square changes periodically every 3 seconds. - **Proof:** Each letter in the event sequence acts as an involution ((h^2 = 1) and (v^2 = 1)). - Reduced word (w^prime) for the sequence simplifies the representation of the color transitions. - Since the sequence of color transitions cycles every 3 steps (red (rightarrow) blue (rightarrow) green (rightarrow) red), it follows that the transitions are periodic every 3 seconds. 6. **Direction and Position Changes:** - Over a 3-second period, the laser undergoes (3r) horizontal events and (3s) vertical events, translating into an odd number of wall collisions. - Hence, at the end of 3 seconds, the laser points in the opposite direction. 7. **Symmetric Position Argument:** - Let (x_t) represent the fractional part of the (x)-coordinate after (t) seconds. - At time (t + 1): [ x_{t+1} = begin{cases} x_t & text{ (Even number of vertical wall collisions)} 1 - x_t & text{ (Odd number of vertical wall collisions)} end{cases} ] - Because there is an odd number of vertical collisions over the three-second period, (x_3 = 1 - x_0). 8. **Conclusion: Symmetry and Closure:** - After 3 seconds, the laser reaches a symmetric position from the starting point. - Given this symmetry, in another 3 seconds (6 seconds total), the laser will complete a closed loop.

Thus, no finite number of true statements alone will suffice to convince the King, since a normal person can make any number of true assertions. Therefore, there is no minimal fixed number of true statements that will achieve your goal. Part (b): How many false statements are needed to convince the king that you are not a normal person? 1. **Understanding How False Statements Affect the King's Perspective:** - Similarly, a normal person can make false statements as well as true statements. - The King's requirement is to distinguish yourself from normal people who can mix truth and lies. 2. **Your Goal:** - Convince the King through false statements that you are not a normal person. - If a certain number of false statements is given, it can still be the act of a normal person. 3. **Analyzing False Statements:** - Any finite number of false statements could be given by a normal person on some days, as normal people can also lie.

By plugging in the answer choices, we can find that when n = 13, both coefficients are equal to 364. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{13}."},{"prompt":"Rosie can make three pies using twelve apples and six oranges. How many pies can she make if she has thirtysix apples and eighteen oranges?","completion":"1. Determine the number of pies Rosie can make per apple and per orange. In the initial setup: - From twelve apples, she can make three pies, so per apple, she needs frac{12}{3} = 4 apples per pie. - From six oranges, she can make three pies, so per orange, she needs frac{6}{3} = 2 oranges per pie. 2. Check if the ratio of apples to oranges remains consistent with the amount needed for one pie: - With thirty-six apples, frac{36}{4} = 9 pies can be made if apples were the only constraint. - With eighteen oranges, frac{18}{2} = 9 pies can be made if oranges were the only constraint. 3. Since both ingredients allow for the same number of pies, Rosie can indeed make 9 pies when considering both apples and oranges. boxed{9} pies can be made."},{"prompt":"Leah, Matt, and Linda are participating in a jump rope challenge.
