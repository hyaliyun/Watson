The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, Trunks' descendants more specifically intermarry with the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] and a sub-branch of the real-life Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [Trunks' descendants intermarrying with both the diclonii and the sub-branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] becoming known as the combined samurai clan/Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon].

Nyaruko-san], passing the position on to her daughter or to the next heiress when she either marries and/or gives birth or another heiress is chosen from among the highest ranks of das Königshaus von Einzbern. The Nyarlathotep H.P Lovecraft wrote about was [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] indeed a real person [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] and the current heiress of das Königshaus von Einzbern at that time, but just choose to portray herself as an eldritch being to him [H.P Lovecraft] because she thought it was funny. Due to the status of containing a copy of the wish-granting artifact known as the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and thus having very strong transmutation [creation and forging of matter |transmutation|] magic and alchemic abilities, along with potent healing magic and the knowledge required both to use the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and their natural powers, along with the ability to use and operate the potent technologies being used by the Nyarlotephians [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore!

The heiresses of das Königshaus von Einzbern also receive the title of \\"Al Azif\\", the physical manifestation [\\"Al-Azif\\"] of the Necronomicon in the minds of those fighting against the occult and/or seeking to expose the occult's control over the non-magical world to those who are unaware of the Clocktower's [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] existence or the existence of the rest of the moonlit world. Back in the 20th century, the apocalyptic event caused by Antarctica being struck by a large asteroid known as Second Impact happened at the end of a late 1980s-early 1990s hot war turned nuclear, between the USSR and USA instead of in 2001 like in the canon NGE. Wukong, forced to survive on the streets and fighting off both organized crime groups, terror organizations, the Soviet and American intelligence communities and secret societies interested in his [Wukong's] power and [Wukong] now living under multiple aliases, [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually [Wukong] captured on and [Wukong] experimented on by the paramilitary secret society/survivalist club/social darwinistic organization that promotes the merger of all humanity into one, SEELE [NGE], [Wukong] eventually escaping but [Wukong] becoming disillusioned with human society as he [Wukong] witnesses the rise of the superhuman abilities known as Quirks and the reemergence of non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [Wukong] developing a second personality that [Wukong's second personality] eventually becomes the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possessive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia]. In the alternate 20th century of this story before Second Impact, Japan continued on its [Japan's] growth towards becoming a economic, industrial and cultural superpower [Japan] in Asia from the 1950s to the late 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" of OTL/real life, the PRC in mainland China disintergrated from the chaos of, surrounding and after Second Impact with Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan and Tibet becoming independent from Han China after Second Impact. Descendants of the horned humanoid extraterrestrial creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke, [descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan] which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan] left the hidden from the rest of the world, semi-feudal with superpowers beyond human imagination sub continent of the Elemental Nations [Naruto] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan] losing its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] position of the imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan] and gods [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in all but name of the Elemental Nations sometime after the fight between the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's sub-clan of the Uchiha clan [Naruto franchise] Madara [Naruto franchise] and his [Madara's] rival for power over the Land of Fire in the Elemental Nations, the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's other side branch of the Senju, Hashirama [Naruto franchise], [the Ōtsutsuki clan leaving the Elemental Nations after Hashirama's and Madara's battle for control over the Land of Fire] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently ended up in feudal Japan, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently marrying into both the diclonii and the Japanese aristocracy and nobility, [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan after Second Impact] use the chaos of Second Impact to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] launch a coup against the crumbling Japanese government and [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] subsequently used the Land of the Rising Sun's [Japan's] technological, military and economical resources to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] conquer their [the descendants' of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] homeland [the Elemental Nations], which [the coup launched against the Japanese government by descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] fails somewhat due to the Ōtsutsuki clan being mistaken as the surviving members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato that have regained their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] divine powers gained from the Shinto Gods, with the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan not bothering to correct the mistake, although the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan do succeed in taking control of both the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa. Japan's government also devolves into a somewhat modernized combination of the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan mistaken for the Imperial House of Great Yamato in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored to their pre-1868 position as Japanese Shoguns. The buke [military families |buke|], better known as samurai of the feudal shogunate-dominated era of Japanese history, [the buke] make a return along with the pre-1947 Japanese aristocracy, even though the pre-1947 Japanese military is also restored as well. Japan then subsequently reclaims the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan, Sahlakin Island and the Kurils in the years after Second Impact, restoring the territorial integrity of Imperial Japan in an event comparable to the formation of the German Empire by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1871. The mass emergence of Quirks due to the after-effects of Second Impact, along with the emergence of Diva [another word |Diva| for |what a Diva is also called| a contracted spirit which |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| is |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ is| manifestation of a creature, a concept, or a character from some mythology or folk belief |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| that |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ does| forms |what a Diva forms| a contract with |the human or supernatural entity a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ forms a contract with| a chosen human or supernatural creature, |the human or supernatural creature a ‘Diva’/contracted spirit forms a contract with| usually being a female between the ages of 13-29 |the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature| being represented by |what the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is represented by| a mark known as |what the mark that represents the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is known as| a Stigima that |the Stigma| usually |the Stigma| is |what normally happens to a Stigma| on the contractor’s right hand, |the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature being known as a Stigma| and |what else the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature does apart from the contractor recieving a stigma| giving the contractor |what the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| the ability to |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| materliaize and use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux |Oblique Neckline/Magical Dress/“Cleavage required” (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux), a special set of armor (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) that (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) most of the time resembles (what a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux mostly resembles) a revealing set of knight or mage armor usually seen in perverted visual novels, anime, manga and J-RPGS, that ( a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) can (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only be used by (who are the only persons who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) female humans and supernatural creatures that (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) have (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) formed contracts with (what supernatural entity the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux have formed contracts with) contracted spirits/‘Divas’, that (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only appears (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) when (the time when a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux appears and can be used) the contractor is in battle or (the contractor) otherwise using more than a small percentage of the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s power| as well as |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with apart from receiving a Stigma and gaining the ability to use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux| the ability to use the the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s she has formed a contract with’s magic, |Divas| from |the media franchise Divas are (Divas) from| Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [the emergence of Quirk users, Diva contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology] necessitates the quick restoration and subsequent implementation of the then prototype pre-Second Impact Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system of national qualification which [the Armed Detective system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Armed Detective to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Armed Detectives] have an Armed Detective license, all across the imperial Japanese shogunate. Post Second Impact, post-CCP, Post-PRC Han China itself restores the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-governed Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled [the restored Empire of China ruling over Han China] by the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as its [the restored Empire of China's] imperial family after a covertly Japanese-backed \\"revolution\\" topples the rump PRC. This restored Great Ming State still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's Twelve Symbols national emblem and [the Beiyang Government's] national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", [the restored Great Ming State] flies a modified the Beiyang Government's \\"Five colored flag\\" which [the five colored flag] is [the five coloured flag] is [the five colored flag] a banner Five horizontal bands of red, yellow, blue, white and black with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol in the middle as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. Yuan Shikai, Sun-Yat-Sen's intended heir Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong are [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] considered to be the people [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] who [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] laid the foundation for the restoration of the Ming in China. The formerly KMT-ruled Nationalist China, formerly [Nationalist China] in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1947, [Nationalist China] manages to take Southern China [Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan] but [Nationalist China] quickly becomes an independent Cantonian republic in all but name. Nationalist China eventually becomes known as the Republic of Cantonia or just Cantonia. Yunnan becomes independent from both Han China and the Nationalist China on Cantonia and [Yunnan] restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government. The pre-WW2 and WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo is restored in post-CCP, PRC, post-Soviet Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and the WW2-era Japanese protectorate Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation is [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] restored [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] in post-CCP, post-PRC Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions and [Mengjiang and Manchukuo] subsequently return to [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] being Japanese protectorates. The restored Great Ming State is [the restored Great Ming State] a Japanese protectorate [the restored Great Ming State] akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China as the WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China. The lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] restored [the Kingdom of Tibet] in Tibet. Japan also restores the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos in Laos and the House of Kobang-ruled Third Burmese Empire in Myanmar. Japan also restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. Both the restored Great Ming State and the restored Manchukuo practice the Beiyang Government's foremost concept of \\"Five Races under One Union\\". The imperial Japanese shogunate is able to spread the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] to all of the nations in Indochina and the China region. Meanwhile in Europe, Germany uses the chaos of the Second Impact to [Germany] regain the Prussian and Czetch territories it [Germany] had lost after WW2. The German House of Hohenzollern-lead Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire returns to power in Germany which [Germany] essentially dominates Europe through the EU after Second Impact. Austria absorbs Czechoslovakia and Hungary into itself to [Austria] reform the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire once more and [Austria] reclaims Transylvania, Banat, Carpathian Ruthenia and South Tyrol, [Austria] then defeating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and [Austria] annexing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. Austria also joins the EU, which [the EU] has [the EU] become a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic WW1-era Mittleeuropa project and NATO, which [NATO] has effectively become a modern day restoration of the Central Powers. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restored German Empire] restoring the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. European Russia is under the rule of a restored Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire which [the restored Russian Empire] is [the restored Russian Empire] an EU member, the rest of post-Second Impact, post-Soviet Russia is under the rule of warlords fighting for power. What is left of civilization in America is divided between a theocratic Charismatic evangelical and Trotskyist neoconservative coalition dominated Republican Party-controlled USA in what remains of the USA in the Northern American states and a neo-Confederacy ruled by the white supremacist, warmongering Anglophile Blue Dog Democrats and the KKK in the South, with the West Coast States being controlled by Japan, New England being owned by Canada and the original thirteen states of the USA being a EU protectorate. Europe and East Asia both restructure the UN into an entity resembling a modernized, worldwide version of the Congress of Vienna, with the Europeans also implementing the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] as well. The regions of the USA and the former USSR that were affected by the nuclear holocaust and Second Impact but were too remote to be reached or had collapsed from the aftermath of the post-WW2 civilization's end became known as \\"the Deathlands\\". The form of civilization that has begun to reappear in these places [\\"the deathlands\\"] is brutal, short lived, morally confused, and crazed from mutation, mostly being small plague pits ruled by warlords who [the warlords ruling the plague pits] have no limits to establish their [the warlords'] rule and [the warlords'] expand their influence, [the warlords] being [the warlords] known as the Barons [Deathlands]. Their [the Barons'] rabble pits are [the Barons' rabble pits] known as [what the Barons' rabble pits are called] villes and baronies. The Hidden Villages [Naruto franchise] of chakra [Naruto franchise] using fake shinobi are [the Hidden Villages in this story] merely [the Hidden Villages in this story] a more developed form of villes and baronies with the Kage of each Hidden Village acting as a combination of Town Mayor and Baron. The Hidden Cloud Village is hidden within Germany, the Hidden Rain Village is located within the ruins of NYC, the Hidden Leaf Village is located in Sacramento and the Greater Era, the Land of Tea is the general name given to Southeast Asia by fake shinobi, the Hidden Mist Village is located within Han China, the Hidden Sand Village is located in Riyadah and the Land of Samurai is the name given to Japan by fake shinobi. Neither the wider world nor the rest of the villes or baronies have any idea the Hidden Villages actually exist. During the Cold War both the USSR and the USA developed hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that [the redoubts] contain teleportation technology known as MAT-TRANS [Matter Transfer]. Returning to Wukong for a bit, he [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually able to [Wukong] regain himself [Wukong] and [Wukong] eventually absorb his [Wukong's] \\"Hiashi\\" persona back into himself [Wukong], [Wukong] gaining access to Hiashi's memories, powers, abilities and skills and even his [Hiashi's] Quirk, even though this [Hiashi becoming whole again] causes him [Wukong] to [Wukong] temporarily go insane, [Wukong] accidentally taking the identity of a then young corporate tycoon in the making with a secretly perverted and lecherous personality, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Hyōdō Gorou when the real Gorou is [the real Gorou] killed while [the real Gorou] searching for perverted manga and anime at a J-AV store. As Gorou, Wukong uses his [Gorou's] identity to [Gorou] build a legitimate identity while [Wukong] using Hiashi's skills, knowledge and abilities to keep his [Wukong's] finances in the clear. As Gorou, Wukong eventually marries Gorou's fiancee who [Gorou's fiancee] is [Gorou's fiancee] the current head [Gorou's fiancee] of the Tōno clan's most public side-branch, the partially Han Chinese family of martial artists and ex-samurai known as the Arima along with being the daughter [Gorou's fiancee] of the supposedly deceased in the eyes of the galaxy, but actually still alive and well on Earth but now elderly current Crown Prince of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], the tall, slender and muscular, wise and calm Masaki Yōshō Jurai [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], who [Yōshō] is [Yōshō] in hiding on Earth as the famed martial artist, swordsman and Shinto priest Masaki Katsuhito [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], in this fic, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, headstrong and steadfast, highly intelligent but secretly shy and soft spoken corporate executive Miki, who [Miki in this story] becomes [Miki in this story] a loving and kind, caring housewife upon the birth of their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] first child, a brown-haired, amber-eyed boy [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] who [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] inherits Wukong's battle-loving, hyperactive and somewhat careless Saiyan personality along with Vegeta's arrogant nature and a weak pyrokinesis quirk along with a sub-Quirk of \\"Gulity Crown\\", which [Guilty Crown] analyzes intron sequences in the human genome and [Guilty Crown] draws out the power hidden within a person by converting it into a manifestation of the targeted person's heart, [that manifestation] being [the manifestation] known as a Void along with the Saiyan bloodline from both Vegeta and Wukong and Miki's intelligence, street-smarts and weak yokai [monster |yokai|] and [Miki's] strong Juraiouke/Masaki Ouchou blood, [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] Issei who [Issei] has [what Issei has] the Seikuriddo Gia [Sacred Gear |Seikuriddo Gia|, an artefact | Seikuriddo Gia| with |what the Seikuriddo Gia has that makes it unique| powerful abilities |belonging to the Seikuriddo Gia| bestowed |upon the Seikuriddo Gia| upon it |the Seikuriddo Gia| by |the divinity that bestowed powerful abilites upon the Seikuriddo Gia| God as part of his |God's| system to |what God bestowed powerful abilities upon the Seikuriddo Gia to do| enact miracles |the Seikuriddo Gia| on Earth] Būsuteddo Gia, [Boosted Gear |Būsuteddo Gia|, a red gauntlet |Būsuteddo Gia| appearing like |what Būsuteddo Gia resembles| a dragon's front paw with a large emerald in the middle |of Būsuteddo Gia| which |Būsuteddo Gia| boosts its |Būsuteddo Gia's| user's ability whenever the |current| user |of Būsuteddo Gia| mentally or verbally requests so], which [Būsuteddo Gia] contains [what Būsuteddo Gia contains as befitting its status as a Seikuriddo Gia] the soul of [the creature whose soul is contained with the Būsuteddo Gia Issei wields] the Sekiryūtei [Red Dragon Emperor |Sekiryūtei|] Y Ddraig Goch, [Y Ddraig Goch] the Red Dragon [Y Ddraig Goch] of [what national mythology or religion Y Ddraig Goch belongs to] Welsh Mythology and [what Y Ddraig Goch is known as] the Red Dragon of Domination [Y Ddraig Goch's other alias |the Red Dragon of Domination|], although his [Issei's] parents [Wukong as Gorou and Miki] don't know this. Of course Miki has no idea who her [Miki's] husband [Gorou] really is and [Miki] doesn't question why their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] son [Issei] is [Issei] born [Issei] with a monkey tail, which [Issei's Saiyan tail] Wukong mind-controls a team of surgical into removing [Issei's monkey tail] when Issei is [Issei] around three, without Miki being aware of it. Ddraig, who [Ddraig] is [Ddraig] in fact [Ddraig] a horny, perverted, extremely lecherous female, [Ddraig] tries to telepathically contact her [Ddraig's] latest host [Issei], which [Ddraig's attempts at reaching out to Issei] make him [Issei] think he [Issei] is [Issei] mentally ill as he [Issei] grows up, although he [Issei] hides this from his [Issei's] parents [Wukong as Gorou and Miki]. Wukong as Gorou also takes the former heiress of Das Königshaus von Einzbern turned its [Das Königshaus von Einzbern's] current modern day head, the mature and responsible but also carefree and ditzy, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, white-haired and red-eyed Irisviel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya], [Wukong as Gorou taking Irisviel] as his [Wukong's as Gorou's] second wife [Irisivel] in all but name after [Wukong as Gorou] rescuing her [Irisivel] from her [Irisivel's] controlling, abusive family [Das Königshaus von Einzbern] while [Wukong as Gorou] on a trip to Germany with Miki and [Wukong as Gorou] subsequently taking her [Irisivel] back to Japan with him [Wukong as Gorou]. Wukong as Gorou and Irisivel then have two children when Issei is [Issei] three years old: Illyasivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] and her [Illyasivel's] younger fraternal twin sister, Chloe von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya]. Illya becomes a somewhat mentally unstable and cold-blooded but cheerful and outgoing, upbeat, friendly, playful, and mischievous individual [Illya] as she [Illya] grows, with Chloe becoming openly calm, nonchalant, devious, manipulative and very observant, brazen and unrestrained and also very lecherous and perverted but also secretly caring, sweet, timid and vulnerable individual as she [Chloe] grows. Chloe and Illya also inherit the Saiyan bloodline from Wukong as Gorou in this story. Miki gives birth to her [Miki's] and Gorou's as Wukong's second child a year later: the short and petite, blonde-haired and amber-eyed, current princess of the yokai and magical side of Kyoto, calm, mature and responsible but also childish and obsessive half-human kitsune [fox |kitsune|] daiyokai [monster lord |daiyokai|] Kunō Illya and Chloe also share the same short, slender, and petite build as they [Illya and Chloe] grow, although they [Illya and Chloe] also both [Illya and Chloe] develop a curvy and buxom figure when they [Illya and Chloe] reach pre-teen age. Illya also [Illya] inherits the position and title of Nyarlathotep and Chloe also inherits the position and title of Necronomicon/\\"Al-Azif\\" from Irisivel. The two girls [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] of course aware of this and [Illya and Chloe] grow up seeing themselves [Illya and Chloe] as soldiers [Illya and Chloe] of love and justice. Miki gives birth to her [Miki's] and Gorou's as Wukong's second child a year later after Illya's and Chloe's birth: When Issei is six years old, he [Issei] finds himself [Issei] in an car accident with his [Issei's] younger maternal cousin in this story, the black-haired, blue-eyed, cute and extremely beautiful, carefully raised with flawless etiquette and bearing, strict, prideful and strong-willed but also secretly very shy and reserved current heiress of the main branch Tōno clan, Tōno Akiha [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] who [Akiha in this story] is [Akiha in this story] two years younger than him [Issei in this story], [young Issei in this story after the accident] spending a good amount of time in the hospital in a coma as, unknown to him [Issei in this story] his [Issei's in this story's] Būsuteddo Gia awakens, [Issei's Boosted Gear] awakening as his [Issei's] body heals from the accident, along with the blood of the now-decimated ex-samurai clan and shinobi order turned demon hunting family having the assassination arts of the ability to attack extraordinarily quickly and the ability to move so quickly as to appear to teleport, moving like spiders to use walls and ceilings as their footholds, and using unpredictable movements to confuse the opponent in combat, developing a murderous impulse against non-humans that became genetic due to focusing on killing demons known as the Nanaya [ Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] in him [Issei in this story], which [Issei's Nanaya blood in this story] comes from his [Issei's in this story's] mother [Miki], causing him [Issei in this story] to [Issei in this story] awaken the ocular bloodline gained from his [Issei’s in this story's] Nanaya blood, the Chokushi no Magan [Magic Eyes of Direct Death |Chokushi no Magan|], which [the Chokushi no Magan] allows him [Issei in this story] to [Issei in this story] see the \\"lines\\" and \\"points\\" of living and inanimate things, but also the death even of space and existence itself, in other words seeing the fate of all things, seeing the future along with the weak points where everything is most easily broken and the imperfection in everything that will break down one day along with [the Chokushi no Magan] possessing the capabilities and abilities of regular eyes [young Issei's awakening of the Chokushi no Magan] causing him [young Issei] to [young Issei] nearly go insane after [young Issei] effortlessly destroying the items in his [young Issei’s] hospital room by simply touching the faultlines in them after [young Issei] awakening from his [young Issei's] coma, before [young Issei] receiving a pair of glasses that [the glasses] suppress his [young Issei's] ocular bloodline [the Chokushi no Magan] and [the glasses] allow him [young Issei] to [young Issei] see normally again from [who young Issei recieved the glasses from] a mysterious tall, red-haired, purple-eyed buxom young woman after [young Issei] escaping from the hospital room in fustration. Young Akiha in this story is [young Akiha in this story] kidnapped [young Akiha in this story] by [who kidnaps young Akiha in this story] agents of the now-centuries-old head of the Matou clan of magi, the aged, semi-immortal, deranged and decrypt Matou Zouken [Fate/Stay Night] and [young Akiha in this story] subsequently made into the Matou clan heiress [young Akiha in this story] via [how young Akiha became the Matou clan heiress] a blood adoption potion and [young Akiha in this story] having the [Matou] clan's Crest Worms [Fate/Stay Night] implanted within her [young Akiha], although she [young Akiha] is [young Akiha] quickly rescued by the Tōno clan's current personal servants, and the current maids of the Tōno house whom [the current maids of the Tōno house] Issei and Akiha in this story see as their [Isseii’s and Akiha’s in this story's] onee-san [older sister/s |onee-san|], the red-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also very buxom, bright and cheerful, very responsible, extremely intelligent and very maternal Fujou “Ako” Kohaku [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and her [Kohaku’s] younger twin who shares her [Kohaku’s] red hair and [Kohaku’s] physical build but [Kohaku’s younger twin] has blue eyes, the publicly stern but privately kind, loving and emotional, track star and accomplished kendoka [one who practices kendo |kendoka|] Fujou “Riko” Hisui [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], [Kohaku and Hisui] killing the worm man [Zouken] in the process and [young Akiha in this story] subsequently brought back to the massive expanse of the Tōno mansion by them [Kohaku and Hisui], although she [Akiha in this story] has immense psychological and mental trauma from this [both the car accident and the kidnapping by Zouken], [Akiha in this story] developing a bad habit of [Akiha's in this story's bad habit] wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha in this story] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha's in this story's] older twin sister in this story, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name Tōsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen's] and Akiha's by now long deceased shared biological mother who [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] was [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] a member [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] of [the group Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother belonged to] the immensely wealthy and influential both in the magical and non-magical worlds, Tōsaka clan [Fate/Stay Night] when she [Karen/Rin] returns from the premier magical institution in the world, the London-based Clocktower [Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin's/Rin's] family [the Tōnos]. Due to the death of Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother's husband and thus Karen's and Akiha's shared biological father the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, brown-haired and blue-eyed calm and soft-spoken Tōno Makihisa [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], in the accident both girls [Karen and Akiha] are [Karen and Akiha] left parentless [Karen and Akiha] and so Gorou and Miki adopt them [Karen and Akiha] as their [Gorou's and Miki's] daughters [Karen's and Akiha's current legal status], making them [Karen and Akiha] Issei's adoptive younger sisters [Karen and Akiha] and [Karen and Akiha] Kunō's, Chloe's and Illya's shared adoptive older sisters [Karen and Akiha]. When Issei is [Issei] six years old, Miki gives birth to her [Miki's] and Wukong's as Gorou's third child, a brown-haired, green-eyed girl whom [Issei's second biological younger full sister] they [Gorou and Miki] name Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], who [Miyako] grows into a short, slender and petite but also secretly buxom, always trying to look strong but in reality very shy and reserved, lacking in self-confidence but highly intelligent and academically gifted peerless genius and child prodigy girl [Miyako] who [Miyako] always wears her [Miyako's] feelings on her [Miyako's] sleeve. The Hyōdōs [Wukong as Gorou, Miki, Irisivel Issei, Miyako, Kunō Chloe and Illya] all [Wukong as Gorou, Miki, Irisivel, Issei, Miyako, Kunō Chloe and Illya] move [Wukong as Gorou, Miki, Irisivel, Issei, Miyako, Kunō, Chloe and Illya] into the gigantic, larger than an all-ages school, European style with heavy Tokugawa era and Imperial Japanese era sprawling mega manor with several private pools, armed security 24/7 along with several libraries both magical and non-magical along with the basement looking like a nuclear bomb shelter designed by a crazy rich person, [the basement] having a dungeon that can confine people for a lifetime, a state of the art, constantly updated research lab with the latest equipment both magical and non-magical and fresh resources always available run by a mere servant, [the basement] appears to be a miniature world that [the basement] functions as a pseudo-absolute monarchy of the Tōno family mansion [ Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and Akiha and Miyako both [Akiha and Miyako] develop deep feelings for Issei, which [Akiha's and Miyako's deep feelings for Issei] amuse the doctor of the Tōno house, the sandy-brown-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and rather buxom, highly intelligent and gifted in both the medical, biochemical and architectural fields, but also very perverted, openly lecherous and somewhat amoral vampire queen posing as a mysterious but famous scientist in the human world while simulanteously trying to live as a normal woman, Dr. Arach [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. When Issei in this story is [Issei] around 15, Miyako begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako's] family's [the Arimas'] dojo on some of Tokyo's native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako's] family's [the Arima's] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, the mythological three-headed dog of Greek mythology known as Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered [Clow] Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako's vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and [Miyako] hoping to impress Issei in this story at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha's help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. As Issei in this story progresses into teenhood he [Issei in this story] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] transform [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya's and Chloe's] mentors in the magical arts, although he [Issei in this story] chooses to [Issei in this story] keep this to himself [Issei in this story]. Also, after being [Issei in this story] bitten by [what bites Issei in this story] the then on the verge of death whimsical, cheerful and somewhat careless, introverted and somewhat reserved immortal blood-drinking fairy princess described in modern terms as a vampire who is also Earth's \\"brain\\", Arcueid Brunestud [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], who [Arcueid in this story] has [Arcueid's in this story's] is [Arcueid in this story] the same entity [Arcueid in this story] as the blonde haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, mostly emotionless and dull but talkative and perverted, ex-child princess of the Middle Ages era turned into immortal vampire queen Laura Acerola [Bakemonogatari], now [Laura] known as [Laura's modern-day alias] the infamous vampire Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade [Bakemonogatari], or just Kiss-Shot [Bakemonogatari], [Arcueid in this story biting Issei in this story] making him [Issei in this story] into a dhampir [half-vampire |dhampir|] and also making her [Arcueid in this story] into his [Issei's in this story's] familiar [Arcueid in this story], which [Arcueid in this story becoming Issei's in this story's familiar] she [Arcueid in this story] is [Arcueid in this story] obviously not amused by. Arcueid in this story resides in Issei's in this story's shadow during the day. Issei in this story keeps the fact that he [Issei in this story] is [Issei in this story] in fact a dhampir from his [Issei's] family [Gorou, Miki, Irisivel, Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Kohaku, Kunō Hisui, Chloe and Illya] and his [Issei's] schoolmates and teachers at [the school Issei attends in this story] Majima Gakuen Kōkō [Majima Private Academy |Majima Gakuen Kōkō], an all-ages [from elementary to university] institution [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] that [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] is [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] for [Majima Gakuen Kōkō's normal student population] the spoiled and not-so spoiled heirs of immensely rich, famous and not-so-famous, along with members of Japan's remaining aristocracy, nobility and corporate families, which [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] is [what happens to Majima Gakuen Kōkō] known [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] as [the other name of Majima Gakuen Kōkō] Kuoh Gakuen [Kuoh Academy |Kuoh Gakuen|], due to it [Majima Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen] being [what happens to Majima Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen] located [where Tenbi Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen is located] near the peaceful small town of [which town Majima Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen is near] Kuoh [High School DxD], which [Kuoh] is [Kuoh] near Japan's Tokugawa shogunate-era capital of Kyoto. The excerpt should focus on Issei being [Issei] attacked by monsters sent from pirates on the other side of the Milky Way while [Issei] heading home from school, [Issei] preparing to [what Issei prepares to |Issei| do] use his [Issei's] Seikuriddo Gia Būsuteddo Gia, [Issei preparing to |Issei| use Būsuteddo Gia] to defend himself [Issei] until three figures whom he [Issei] recognizes as Illya, Miyako and Chloe arrive in a flash of light and a roar of flames, [Illya, Miyako and Chloe] surrounding Issei. Illya wears a white blouse with a white and black polka dot arm trim and a white and black polka dot short skirt with a white and black polka dot bow at the front. Chloe wears a modified version of Japanese gyaru clothes and Miyako wears a heavily modified, red and black hanfu outfit. Illya then summons a red crowbar and [Illya] proceeds to [Illya] brutally fight off the aliens, with Chloe casting spells and Miyako using her [Miyako's] martial arts skills and [Miyako's] flames to destroy the monsters. When it's all over, the monsters lie dead around him [Issei] while Chloe, Illya and Miyako surround him [Issei]. The sounds of footsteps rushing up causes Issei to look up only for him [Issei] to see both Akiha and Rin/Karen rushing up to him [Issei], the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and rather buxom, publicly graceful and elitist but secretly competitive and perfectionist current heiress of the immensely wealthly Swedish-Finnish noble house in both the non-magical and magical worlds, the House of Edelfelt, Luviagelita [Fate/Stay Night] and her [Luvia's] ward and Chloe's and Illya's rival who is the heiress of the long-defunct Sakatsuki branch family of the Emiyas, the black-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also secretly curvy and buxom, highly intelligent and academically gifted, openly mature, dutiful, and rather unfriendly but secretly caring, vulnerable and dedicated Sakatsuki Miyuki [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya], who [Miyuki] goes by the identity of Miyu Edelfelt [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] while [Miyuki] in public as Illya, Chloe and Miyako glomp him [Issei]. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","completion":"Issei's breath fogged in the chilly autumn air as he made his way home from Majima Gakuen Kōkō. His mind was preoccupied with the day's events, barely registering the eerie silence of the streets. That silence was shattered when a grotesque snarl echoed through the air, followed by the unmistakable sound of slithering bodies. He turned just in time to see a group of monstrous creatures emerge from the shadows, their eyes glinting with malice. Issei's heart raced, his mind frantically recalling every bit of combat training he'd received. The creatures advanced, and he knew he stood no chance on his own. His hands shook as he mentally reached out to the Būsuteddo Gia, the Seikuriddo Gia granted to him, waiting for the familiar surge of power. It didn't come. Just as he braced for the end, a flash of light and a roaring flame announced the arrival of three familiar figures. Illya, Chloe, and Miyako landed with superhero grace, immediately taking defensive positions around him. Illya, dressed in her signature white and black outfit, spun a red crowbar with effortless ease, her expression steely. Chloe, her gyaru outfit surprisingly battle-ready, began chanting, her hands weaving through complex gestures. Miyako, in her striking red and black hanfu, ignited in flames that danced around her fists. The battle that followed was a blur. Illya charged with a battle cry, her crowbar a red blur as it connected with the first monster, sending it flying. Chloe's spells arced through the air, explosive runes detonating upon impact and tearing through the creatures with ruthless efficiency. Miyako was a whirlwind of fire and fists, her martial arts moves enhanced by the flames that left trails of destruction in her wake. As the last monster fell, Issei could only stare in awe and relief. He was saved, again, by his incredibly powerful allies... and family. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of hurried footsteps. \\"Akiha, Rin!\\" he greeted, almost collapsing in relief at the sight of them, followed closely by Luvia and Miyu, their expressions ranging from concern to annoyance at the chaos they'd stumbled upon. Illya, Chloe, and Miyako didn't wait for a second invitation; they tackled Issei in a group glomp, causing him to wheeze for air. \\"Are you alright?\\" Illya asked, her eyes scanning him for injuries. Before Issei could assure them he was fine, Chloe piped up, her words laced with mock severity, \\"You really need to be more careful, you know. We can't always be there to save your butt.\\" Miyako nodded in agreement, the flames that had previously surrounded her now extinguished. \\"He's right. Plus, we might not mind saving you, but it's definitely not going to help your reputation.\\" As the group descended into good-natured teasing and laughter, Issei couldn't help but feel a profound sense of belonging.

While you can't completely eliminate all the headers for the views because they contain important information such as dates and task names, you can adjust or minimize their appearance. Here's how you can customize your Gantt chart view in the latest versions of Microsoft Project to effectively \\"remove\\" or reduce the visibility of headings: # If You Want to Adjust the Timescale Headers: 1. **Open your project in MS Project.** 2. **Switch to the Gantt Chart view** (if not already in it), by clicking on the \\"View\\" tab and then selecting \\"Gantt Chart\\" from the Task Views group. 3. **Right-click on the timescale at the top of the Gantt Chart** (where the dates are displayed). 4. **Choose \\"Timescale.\\"** A dialog box will open. 5. In the dialog box, you have the option to **adjust the \\"Middle Tier\\" and \\"Bottom Tier\\".** For instance, you can set both to \\"None\\" to minimize the amount of information displayed. This will reduce the appearance of headings relating to time. 6. **Click \\"OK\\" to apply the changes.** # If You Want to Adjust Column Headers: 1. **Right-click on a column header** to bring up the column menu. 2. **Choose \\"Hide Column\\"** if you want to completely remove specific columns. This could help in simplifying the \\"headings\\" visible in your chart. 3. If you just want to change what’s displayed in the columns (and thus affect the headers), choose **“Insert Column”** and then select the information you want to see. Replace any columns you don’t need with those you do. # Other Customizations: - **Split View:** You can also reduce the emphasis on the Gantt Chart itself by using the \\"Split View.\\" Go to the \\"View\\" tab, and in the \\"Split View\\" group, check \\"Details.\\" This allows for focus on task form or resources form at the bottom while minimizing the Gantt chart above. - **Task Name:** If you're trying to minimize attention on task names or other task-related info, consider adjusting or narrowing your task list by filtering or customizing the table to show minimized details. It's important to keep in mind that certain headers, especially in the print layout, might not be completely removable due to the way Microsoft Project structures its views and reports. However, through a combination of column adjustments and timescale customizations, you can significantly reduce their prominence. For extensive customization beyond what's available within Microsoft Project's built-in features, consider exporting your Gantt chart to another format (e.g., PDF or an image) and using image editing software or another document editor to manually remove or edit headers before sharing your project schedule. Always save your original project file before making substantial changes or exporting."},{"prompt":"it has task names as the headings","completion":"If you're seeing task names as headings in your Gantt Chart in Microsoft Project and your goal is to remove or hide them, here is a more focused approach on how to address the task names specifically: # Hiding Task Names in the Gantt Chart The task names in Microsoft Project appear on the left side of the screen in a table format next to the Gantt chart itself. If you want to remove or hide these task names but keep the graphical part of the Gantt chart visible, follow these steps: 1. **Open your project in Microsoft Project.** 2. **Switch to the Gantt Chart view** if not already in it, by clicking on the \\"View\\" tab and selecting \\"Gantt Chart\\" from the Task Views group. 3. **Resize the Task Name Column:** - Drag the divider between the table and the Gantt chart itself to the right, essentially 'hiding' the task names by making them not visible. This action won't remove task names but will temporarily hide them from the view you're working on. It's handy for screenshots or presentations. 4. **Hide the Column:** - Alternatively, right-click on the \\"Task Name\\" column header and choose \\"Hide Column\\" from the context menu. This will remove the Task Name column from view. However, be aware that doing this may limit the functionality or the information you can see at a glance since task names are crucial for identifying tasks. # Considerations - The **Gantt chart** is inherently tied to the tasks listed, as it visually represents the task timeline. Completely removing task names while keeping the Gantt chart may not always be practical within Microsoft Project if the intent is to still understand or present project schedules. - For **presenting or sharing purposes**, consider taking a screenshot of the Gantt chart portion only, or use the \\"Copy Picture\\" feature (on the Task tab, in the Clipboard group, click Copy Picture) to capture the Gantt chart for pasting into another program like PowerPoint or Word, where you can further edit or hide specific elements. - If you need to **share a Gantt chart without task names for confidentiality reasons**, consider manually editing the screenshot/image in a photo editing tool to blur or remove the task names, or re-label them with generic identifiers before sharing. Remember, removing task names from the view might limit the ability to effectively manage and review your project within Microsoft Project, as the names provide context and identification for the tasks scheduled. Consider these steps as temporary solutions for presentation or specific sharing purposes rather than permanent changes to your project management methodology."},{"prompt":"remove lines on gantt chart ms project","completion":"Removing or modifying lines in the Gantt chart part of Microsoft Project can help create a cleaner look for presentations or simplify the view for your specific needs. While Microsoft Project doesn't offer a direct \\"remove all lines\\" button for Gantt charts, you can make adjustments to achieve a similar effect. Here are a few strategies you can apply: # Modifying Gantt Chart Style 1. **Change Task Bars Appearance:** - In Microsoft Project, go to the **Format** tab while in the Gantt Chart view. Here, you can modify individual elements of your Gantt Chart, including bar styles and colors. While this doesn't remove lines per se, changing bar colors to match the background (or using very light colors) can make the lines less noticeable. 2. **Bar Styles Dialog Box:** - Use the **Bar Styles** dialog box to modify the appearance of bars. Right-click on the blank space of the Gantt Chart, and then click on **Bar Styles**. From here, you can modify how each task type is displayed. For example, you might choose to remove the middle line (progress line) or change its color to match the bar's color, making it less visible. # Adjusting Gridlines 1. **Customize Gridlines:** - Go to the **Format** tab, and select **Gridlines**. Choose which gridlines you want to modify (for instance, \\"Vertical Gridlines\\") and then choose a style. You can set the line color to white or match the background to effectively \\"remove\\" them visually. Alternatively, you can choose a style that is barely visible. 2. **Nonworking Time:** - Still under the **Format** tab, you can adjust the **Nonworking Time** color to match your chart's background. This won't remove lines but can help minimize visual clutter by making nonworking time less distinct. # Simplifying the Gantt Chart 1. **Bar Rollup and Bar Cleanup:** - Utilize the **Bar Rollup** and **Bar Cleanup** features (found in the **Project** tab under \\"**Gantt Chart Tools**\\") to simplify your Gantt chart which can, directly and indirectly, minimize the appearance of various lines by consolidating task bars. 2. **Turn Off Gantt Chart Split:** - If your Gantt chart has a split view showing the task form or details, turning it off can simplify what’s on your screen, making the Gantt portion appear cleaner. You can do this from the **View** tab by deselecting the split view option. # Important Considerations - While making these adjustments, remember that each change may have implications for how your project's information is conveyed. The goal of a Gantt chart is to provide a clear, visual representation of a project's timeline, so be careful not to remove essential readability or functionality for the sake of aesthetics. - Always save your original view settings or create a new custom view before making extensive changes, so you can revert if needed. These steps are based on recent versions of Microsoft Project (such as 2016, 2019, and for Microsoft 365). The exact navigation and options available might vary slightly between versions."},{"prompt":"im talking about the lines connecting tasks","completion":"Ah, you're referring to the dependency lines, often called \\"link lines\\" or \\"task dependencies,\\" which show the relationships between tasks in the Gantt chart of Microsoft Project. These lines are crucial for understanding how tasks relate to one another (for example, a finish-to-start dependency). However, there might be scenarios where you want to either remove or hide these lines for presentation or clarity purposes. Here's how: # To Hide Dependency Lines in Microsoft Project Microsoft Project doesn't provide a direct option to delete all dependency lines globally because they're an integral part of project scheduling, displaying the relationships between tasks. However, you can hide these link lines in the Gantt chart view: 1. **Method 1: Format Tab (For MS Project 2010 and later)** - Go to the **Format** tab on the Ribbon. - In the **Bar Styles** group, you will find an option called **Layout**. Click on it. - In the Layout dialog box, you will see an option for **Link Styles**. Here, you have the option to deselect the \\"Show link lines\\" checkbox. - Click **OK** to apply your changes. The link lines between tasks will now be hidden in your Gantt chart view. 2. **Method 2: Adjust Individual Task Dependencies (Manual Method)** - If you want to remove the dependency lines for specific tasks rather than hiding all of them, you can do so by deleting the dependency itself. This method, however, is usually not recommended because it affects the project schedule directly. If you choose this method, proceed by: - Double-clicking on a task to open the **Task Information** dialog box. - Go to the **Predecessors** tab. - Select the dependency you wish to remove and press **Delete**. - Click **OK**. The link line associated with that specific dependency will be removed. 3. **Method 3: Using a Different View (Alternative Approach)** - If your objective is to present or review tasks without visual dependencies, consider using a different view like the **Task Sheet** or the **Task Details Form**. These views focus on task information without showing the Gantt chart or dependency lines. - Switch to these views from the **View** tab by selecting from the available options in the **Task Views** or **Resource Views** group. # Important Considerations - While hiding or removing dependency lines might be necessary for certain presentations or for simplifying the visual complexity of your project, it's essential to remember that these dependencies are crucial for understanding task sequences and project scheduling. Always consider the implications of not having this visual information available. - Before making any changes that might affect your project schedule (like deleting task dependencies), consider saving a copy of your project file. This way, you can maintain the integrity of your original scheduling data. Depending on your version of Microsoft Project, the exact steps or terminologies may vary slightly, but the overall approach remains consistent across recent versions, including Microsoft Project 2016, 2019, and Microsoft 365."},{"prompt":"add task names to end of gantt chart","completion":"Adding task names to the end of the Gantt bars in Microsoft Project enhances the readability of your charts, especially when you want to share your project timeline with stakeholders who may prefer a clear visual representation of tasks alongside their corresponding timelines. As of my last update, Microsoft Project does not offer a direct feature to automatically add task names to the end of the Gantt bars. However, you can achieve a similar effect using text labels for Gantt bars and some workarounds. Here’s how you can do it: # Using Bar Styles to Modify Text Labels 1. **Open Your Project:** Launch Microsoft Project and open the project you want to modify. 2. **Access Bar Styles:** - Go to the **Gantt Chart** view if you're not already there. - Right-click on the Gantt chart area and select **Bar Styles** from the context menu. This action opens the Bar Styles dialog box where you can customize how each task type is represented on the Gantt chart. 3. **Customize Text for Bars:** - In the Bar Styles dialog box, find the row representing the type of task you want to add the task names for (e.g., \\"Task\\", \\"Summary\\", \\"Milestone\\"). - Look to the right side of the dialog box for the \\"Text\\" tab. - Here, you can choose where to place text in relation to the task bars. To add task names to the end of the Gantt bars, click in the \\"Right\\" column for the task type you're modifying. - From the dropdown, select \\"Name\\" or another attribute if you prefer different text. This will place the task's name to the right of the Gantt bar. 4. **Repeat for Other Task Types:** If you want consistent labeling across your project, make sure to repeat this process for other task types (such as Summary Tasks and Milestones) as needed. 5. **Click “OK”** to apply the changes. You should now see the task names appearing at the end of the bars on the Gantt chart. # Additional Workaround: Manually Adding Text Boxes If you need more flexibility or want to add labels that the Bar Styles feature can't accommodate, you can manually add text labels by: 1. **Exporting the Gantt Chart:** Use the \\"Copy Picture\\" feature (found in the \\"Task\\" tab in the Clipboard group) to take a snapshot of your Gantt chart that you can paste into a program like Microsoft PowerPoint or Word. 2. **Adding Text Labels Manually:** Once you've pasted your Gantt chart image, you can manually add text boxes over the chart to place labels exactly where you want them. This method is more labor-intensive and best suited for final presentations, where you won't need to frequently update the information. # Considerations: - Always remember that manual adjustments or using external programs for labeling can make it challenging to keep the Gantt chart up to date with project changes. - For external presentations, consider the audience's needs and the level of detail required. Sometimes, simplifying the information leads to better comprehension. This workaround provides a way to visually enhance your Gantt charts for presentations or specific reporting needs, despite the lack of a direct feature within Microsoft Project for adding names to the end of Gantt bars. Always ensure to save your original project file before making extensive visual modifications for external purposes."},{"prompt":"Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture.","completion":"To explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture, let's start with a basic understanding of those concepts: - **Elemental composition by mass** refers to the proportion of each element within a compound or a mixture, measured by mass. For a pure compound, it represents the mass percentages of each element that makes up the compound. This can be determined by breaking down the compound into its constituent elements or by summing the masses of the individual elements in a known chemical formula. - **Composition of substances in a mixture** involves the mass percentages (or volume percentages for solutions) of each substance present in the mixture. Unlike a pure compound, a mixture consists of two or more substances (elements or compounds) that are physically combined but not chemically bonded, and thus each substance retains its chemical identity. # Quantitative Relationship: The link between these two concepts is primarily governed by the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. The implications of this law for a mixture are twofold: 1. **Total Mass of the Mixture**: The total mass of the mixture is equal to the sum of the mass of its individual components. This principle is essential in calculating the mass percentage of each substance in a mixture. 2. **Mass Percentage of an Element in the Mixture**: The mass percentage of an individual element within the mixture can be determined by adding up the contributions of that element from each substance in the mixture. This requires knowing the elemental composition by mass of each substance and the mass (or proportion) of each substance in the mixture. # Example: Consider a mixture composed of water (H2O) and ethanol (C2H5OH). 1. **Determine the Mass Percentage of Each Substance**: Suppose you have a mixture containing 90g of water and 10g of ethanol. The total mass of the mixture is 90g + 10g = 100g. Therefore, the mass percentage of water in the mixture is (90g / 100g) * 100% = 90%, and for ethanol, it's (10g / 100g) * 100% = 10%. 2. **Calculate the Elemental Composition by Mass of the Mixture**: - Water's elemental composition by mass is roughly 11.2% hydrogen and 88.8% oxygen. - Ethanol's composition by mass includes carbon (52.14%), hydrogen (13.13%), and oxygen (34.73%). To find, for example, the total mass percentage of hydrogen in the mixture, you would weigh the contributions of hydrogen from both water and ethanol, taking into account their mass percentages in the mixture. For water, that's 90% * 11.2% = 10.08% of hydrogen by mass of the mixture. For ethanol, it's 10% * 13.13% = 1.313%. Adding these contributions gives 10.08% + 1.313% = 11.393% hydrogen by mass in the mixture. # Conclusion: Understanding the quantitative relationship between elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture allows for precise calculations regarding the overall chemical makeup of the mixture. This is crucial in fields such as chemistry, material science, and chemical engineering, where the composition greatly affects the properties and reactivity of materials and mixtures."},{"prompt":"Write a dialog script, about Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from Zootopia (2016) and Mr. Wolf from The Bad Guys (2022).

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity","completion":"Absolutely, let's dive into the composition of mixtures with an emphasis on understanding the quantitative relationship between elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. This concept is fundamental in various scientific disciplines, including chemistry and chemical engineering. # 1. Understanding Substances and Mixtures - **Pure Substances**: These are materials made of only one type of molecule or formula unit. They have a constant composition throughout and can either be elements or compounds. - **Mixtures**: Unlike pure substances, mixtures consist of two or more different types of molecules or formula units. The key characteristic of mixtures is that the proportion of their components can vary. They can be homogeneous (the composition is uniform throughout, e.g., solutions) or heterogeneous (the composition is not uniform, e.g., oil and water). # 2. Importance of Elemental Analysis Elemental analysis is a method used to determine what elements are present in a compound or mixture and in what proportion. It's a crucial tool in verifying the purity of substances and identifying the exact composition of mixtures in terms of their elemental makeup. There are several methods for conducting elemental analysis, including spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. # 3. Quantitative Relationship in Mixtures When we look at a mixture, the total mass of the mixture is the sum of the masses of its individual components. The concept of mass percent is often used to describe the composition of a mixture quantitatively. - **Mass Percent (Mass %)**: This is a way of expressing the concentration of an element in a compound or a component in a mixture. It is calculated as the mass of the component divided by the total mass of the mixture, multiplied by 100%. [ text{Mass Percent (Mass %)} = left( frac{text{Mass of Component}}{text{Total Mass of Mixture}} right) times 100% ] # 4. Application in Determining Purity and Composition - **Determining Purity**: Elemental analysis can be used to determine the purity of a substance by comparing the measured elemental composition with the theoretical composition based on its molecular formula. - **Analyzing Mixtures**: By knowing the masses of different components in a mixture and the total mass, we can calculate the mass percent of each component, allowing us to understand the mixture's composition quantitatively. # Example Exercise Suppose you have a mixture of salt (NaCl) and water (H2O) weighing 100 g in total. If the mixture contains 20 g of NaCl, you can calculate the mass percent of NaCl and water in the mixture as follows: - **Mass percent of NaCl**: (left( frac{20 , text{g}}{100 , text{g}} right) times 100% = 20%) - **Mass percent of water**: Since the total mass is 100 g, the mass of water is 100 g - 20 g = 80 g. Thus, (left( frac{80 , text{g}}{100 , text{g}} right) times 100% = 80%). To sum up, the comprehension of mixtures and the quantitative relationships regarding their composition are crucial for analyzing and understanding the elemental makeup of substances. This knowledge is fundamental in applications ranging from chemical manufacturing to quality control in laboratories."},{"prompt":"Write an intresting, action-packed, martial-arts filled, dialogue-filled excerpt for a crossover fanfic between the Gun-ota ga Mahou Sekai ni Tensei Shitara, Gendai Heiki de Guntai Harem o Tsukucchaimashita!?

A saga where science and magic, warriors and tacticians, empires and rebels collide in a tumultuous dance of power, love, and betrayal. Our story finds its rhythm in a moment of unprecedented convergence, as heroes and antiheroes from across the cosmos encounter one another on the stage of history. --- **On the Surface of a War-Torn Planet** Kakkarot, now known as Sun Wukong but feel the Saiyan blood coursing through his veins, crouched beside Bulma Briefs, their gazes locked onto the holographic map displaying their next strategic location. Across from them, clad in Mandalorian armor, stood a Spartan-II, designation Master Chief, his visor reflecting the determined faces of the gathered ensemble. \\"Your ki control, it's like nothing I've seen before,\\" Master Chief noted, addressing Sun Wukong. \\"The Covenant, the Empire, they've faced Jedi and Mages, but you...you're different.\\" Wukong grinned, \\"It's all in the training — and maybe a bit of Saiyan heritage,\\" his eyes twinkling with the thrill of forthcoming battles. Around them, a motley crew of figures from across dimensions stood ready, among them, Tatsuya Shiba, with his calm and unnerving composure, and Luke Skywalker, whose presence alone inspired a silent awe. Suddenly, the air crackled with energy as a portal ripped open, disgorging an assembly of Juraian warriors led by Ayeka Masaki Jurai. With a composed elegance, Ayeka surveyed the gathering, her gaze lingering on Master Chief and Sun Wukong. \\"We've come to lend our strength,\\" Ayeka announced, her voice carrying a note of reserved pride. \\"The Juraians and Saiyans under our command will fight alongside you.\\" Before further alliances could be forged, a chilling laugh echoed across the battlefield, heralding the arrival of an enemy coalition led by a figure resonating with dark ki, Darth Vader, flanked by Elites and Demonbane pilots. \\"Your unions are meaningless before the might of the Empire and our allies,\\" Vader's modulated voice boomed, lightsaber igniting with a menacing hiss. In response, Sun Wukong stepped forward, power surging around him as he transformed, his aura blazing. \\"Let's settle this the old-fashioned way,\\" he challenged, his voice steady and full of confidence. Without another word, the two forces clashed in a maelstrom of blaster fire, magic spells, lightsaber duels, and physical combat that would have torn the fabric of any ordinary world asunder. Bulma, working alongside Nyaruko and Rin Tohsaka, orchestrated the logistics and support, their combined intellect enabling miraculous feats of battlefield coordination and strategy. As the battle raged, Master Chief, engaging in a deadly dance with Elite Zealots, found himself fighting back-to-back with Tatsuya, whose Decomposition magic laid waste to any who dared approach. Elsewhere, Luke Skywalker, lightsaber whirling in a deadly arc, moved in harmony with Wukong's ki-enhanced strikes, their combined might overwhelming even the most formidable of foes. In the heart of the chaos, a profound realization unfolded among them - in this moment, their stories, their struggles, and their hopes were one. They were not merely warriors from disparate worlds thrown together by fate; they were a unified front against a common enemy. As the final enemy fell, a tentative silence enveloped the battlefield, broken only by the heavy breaths of those who remained standing. Wukong, reverting back to his base form, exchanged nods with Master Chief and Luke, a non-verbal acknowledgment of their shared victory and the battles yet to come. \\"We've won this day, but there's still much to do,\\" Ayeka stated, her tone somber yet hopeful. \\"Together, I believe there's no enemy we can't face.\\" As the group gathered, their differences in origin, purpose, and power seeming insignificant now, a new dawn broke across the horizon - a symbol of their united stand against the darkness, a testament to the power of alliances forged in the heat of battle, and a harbinger of the epic saga yet to unfold. --- In this crucible of cosmic conflict, where destinies intertwine and legends are born, the unlikely heroes of a multiverse stand united, ready to face whatever the future may hold, bound by a shared resolve to protect their worlds and defeat their enemies, no matter the cost."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[어디로 가야 하지?] 나와 마크가 어리둥절한 얼굴로 오락가락하는 사이에 멀리서 피터가 손을 흔들었다. “성국! 마크!” 그리고 피터 옆에 그 유명한 찰리 잡스가 서 있었다. [생전에 찰리 잡스를 보다니….] 나는 흥분된 가슴을 진정시키며 걸어갔다. 마크도 잔뜩 긴장한 게 보였다. 찰리 잡스는 유쾌한 미소를 지으며 악수를 권했다. 나는 얼른 찰리 잡스의 손을 잡았다. “반가워. 피터한테 이야기 많이 들었어.” “저는 찰리 이야기를 항상 듣고 있어요. 온 미디어가 당신 이야기를 보도하잖아요.” “피터 말대로 정말 유쾌한 친구구나. 열두 살에 하버드 들어간 거 사실이야?” “쉽지만은 않았어요.” 찰리 잡스는 내 말에 유쾌하게 웃어줬다. 곧 마크와도 인사를 나눴다. “프로그래머라며?” “네.” “이 친구도 대단하네. 둘 다 하버드생이지?” “네.” “역시 천재들이 세상을 움직이는 게 사실인가 봐요.” “찰리, 자네도 천재라는 말이지?” 피터가 묻자 찰리는 아무렇지 않게 고개를 끄덕였다. “당연하죠. 자, 제가 특별히 아플 소개 좀 해드릴게요.” 찰리는 나와 마크에게 아플 캠퍼스로 명명된 이 지역을 샅샅이 알려줬다. 나는 걸어가는 찰리를 보면서 조금 고개를 갸웃했다. 분명 미국 어느 신문에서도 찰리의 암 투병 사실이나 의혹을 보도한 곳은 없었다. 지금 찰리는 헐렁한 바지를 입고 있었다. 허리띠로 허리를 조이긴 했지만, 누가 봐도 한 치수 이상 차이 나는 바지였다. 찰리 잡스의 성격상 자기 몸에 딱 맞지 않는 옷을 입고 있다는 것은 최근에 급격하게 체중이 줄었다는 것을 의미했다. 아니면 옷을 사도 계속 줄고 있든가. 찰리가 웃으며 아플 캠퍼스 소개를 끝냈다. “자, 다음은 누가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 대해서 소개해줄 거지?” “제가 할게요. 물론 마크가 기술적인 부분은 설명할 거예요.” “그럼, 사무실로 갈까?” “네!” 우리는 찰리를 따라 사무실로 향했다. * * * 아플사의 사무실에서, 더군다나 찰리 잡스 앞에서 내가 마크와 창업하는 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ PT를 하게 되다니…. 강심장인 나였지만, 심장이 살짝 벌렁거렸다. 최대한 심호흡을 하고 나는 앞으로 나가서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 대한 설명을 시작했다. “저희의 목표는 ‘심플 이즈 더 베스트’라는 겁니다. 현재에도 다양한 나라에서 각종 SNS가 활발히 운영 중입니다. 하지만 전 세계 사람들을 하나로 연결하는 SNS는 아직 등장하지 않았습니다. 그 이유는 각 나라의 정서에 맞춰서 개발을 진행했기 때문이죠. 하지만 ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 동양인인 저와 미국인인 마크가 서로의 정서를 교환하면서 만든 SNS입니다. 그래서 누구나 편하게, 누구나 쉽게 접속하고 친구들과 연결될 수 있는 최대의 장점을 가지고 있습니다.” 내 PT가 끝나자 찰리 잡스가 박수를 쳤다. “궁금한 게 있는데, 앞으로 이 ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 활성화되기 위해서는 뭐가 필요하다고 생각하나?” [그거야 아플사가 곧 만들 아플폰이지.] 나는 싱긋 웃었다. “찰리, 찰리가 앞으로 만들어주실 거잖아요.” “내가?” 찰리가 의아한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “아플에서 손안에 들고 다니는 컴퓨터를 개발하실 거잖아요?” 갑자기 찰리의 눈이 커졌다. 아플폰 출시는 몇 년 후이다. 지금은 비밀리에 아플폰을 개발 중인 게 분명했다. “성국, 그게 무슨 말이야?” “저는 최근에 노트북의 소형화나 아플팟 같은 것을 보면서 수년 안에 핸드폰 사이즈의 전화 겸용 노트북이 나올 수 있다고 보거든요.” “그럴 수가 있나. 키보드는 그럼?” 피터가 의아한 얼굴로 물었다. “키보드가 필요 없죠. 터치스크린으로 모든 게 해결될 텐데요. 찰리, 어때요?” “흠… 멋진데…. 터치스크린이라….” “지금은 다들 SNS를 컴퓨터로 하지만, 만약 손에 들고 다니는 노트북 같은 핸드폰이 나온다면 이 SNS 시장은 전 세계적으로 급속히 성장할 거예요.” 나는 자신 있게 이야기했다. 턱을 매만지던 찰리가 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 자네가 나한테 굉장한 영감을 줘서 나도 선물을 하나 주고 싶은데, 받을 건가? 별거 아니라고 생각하면 안 받아도 돼.” “대가는 없는 거죠?” “당연하지. 오늘 난 성국이 이야기를 듣고 아주 굉장한 영감을 받았거든.” “그럼, 말씀해 보세요. 듣고 결정할게요.” 찰리가 빙긋 웃더니 입을 열었다. “성국이 말한 대로 전 세계 사람들을 사로잡으려면 이름이 좀 더 간편해질 필요가 있는 거 같아서. ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 너무 길잖아. ‘페이스 노트’ 어때?” 나는 마크를 쳐다봤다. 마크는 마음에 들어 하는 눈치였다. 나 역시 마음에 들었다. 하지만 내색은 하지 않았다. “찰리, 고마워요. 공동 창업자인 마크와 상의해 볼게요.” “얼마든지.” 곧이어 마크가 프로그램에 대해서 열띤 설명을 시작했다. 평소 수줍어하는 마크도 곧잘 이야기를 풀어 나갔다. * * * 3시간 정도의 만남이었지만, 나와 찰리는 서로의 아이디어를 교환하기까지 했다. 찰리는 아쉬운 기색으로 우리와 작별 인사를 나눴다. “성국, 마크. 내가 약속이 있어서 저녁까지는 같이 못 하는 거 미안해.” “바쁜 시간 내주셔서 감사해요.” “다음에 기회가 있으면 또 봐. 피터도 잘 가고요. 우리 주식 이젠 좀 마음 풀고 사요. 우리 아플사 앞으로 나올 제품들은 세상을 바꿀 거니까, 절대 내려갈 일은 없어요.” “자네가 사고만 안 치면 내려갈 일이야 당연히 없지. 뉴욕 가서 연락할게.” 그렇게 우리는 헤어졌다. 나는 그때 조금 슬픈 예감이 들었다. 찰리 잡스와의 만남은 이게 마지막일 것이라는 그런 슬픈 예감. * * * 피터는 우리와 숙소로 향했다. “성국, 찰리한테 엄청 큰 영감을 준 모양이야. 찰리가 다른 사람이나 기업을 위해서 아이디어 주는 일은 진짜 드물거든.” “저도 잘 모르겠어요.” [아마 터치스크린에 대한 부분일 것이야, 피터. 삼전 전자에서도 한창 개발하던 일이었다고. 아플사가 좀 더 빨리 냈을 뿐이야.] 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐었다. “참, 찰리가 낸 이름 어때? 좀 더 직관적이고 음절도 줄어서 난 편한 거 같은데.” ‘페이스 노트’ 확실히 편했다. “발음하기도 편하고요. 정말 친구들과 나누던 교환 일기나 롤링페이퍼를 연상시켜서 더 친근한 느낌도 있어요. 그리고 제일 마음에 드는 것은 ‘페이스 노트’ 이름 탄생에 대한 일화가 전 세계 사람들 입에 아마 오르내릴 것 같거든요.” “성국, 그게 무슨 말이야?” 마크가 물었다. “‘페이스 페이퍼’를 만든 하버드생 두 명과 실리콘밸리의 신화인 아플사의 찰리 잡스가 우리에게 영감을 받고, 제안해준 이름. 이런 이야기가 우리 성공 뒤에 널리 알려질 것 같다고….” 나는 빙긋 웃었다. “정말 너는 하는 말이나 행동 보면 꼭 다 성공한 사람 같다니까. 성국, 정신 차려. 우린 아직 갈 길이 멀었어.” “마크 말 들으니 정말 성국이는 찰리랑 비슷한 면이 많은 것 같아. 자아도취도 아주 닮았어.” 다들 뭐라고 해도, 내 귀에는 안 들렸다. 나는 미래의 한 페이지를 상상하며 흐뭇한 미소를 지었다. 마크 주크버스가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 만든다는 것을 알고 있었다. 하지만 여러 노력 끝에 찰리 잡스를 만나 이름이 바뀌고, 새로운 스토리가 주어지는 것은 내가 알던 미래에는 없었다. 미약하지만, 나로 인해 바뀌는 미래도 분명 존재했다. * * * 호텔에 돌아오자마자 나는 보유하고 있는 아플 주식을 모두 팔았다. “성국, 뭐 하는 거야? 아플 주식을 왜 팔아?” “조만간 좀 떨어질 것 같아서.” “무슨 소리야. 우리 오늘 찰리 잡스 만나고 왔잖아. 실리콘밸리의 신화. 찰리 잡스 말로는 세상을 바꿀 제품이 조만간 출시될 거라잖아.” [응. 그 전에 찰리가 암 수술 받은 게 터져서 주식이 왕창 내려가. 아마 조만간 터질 거야.] 나는 우유를 쭉 들이켰다. “마크, 난 그냥 그 좋은 행운의 시기에 다른 사람들이 아플 주식을 더 많이 사기 바라서 그래. 다른 데 투자하고 싶은 데가 있기도 하고.” “정말 너는 이해할 수 없는 부분이 있어.” [걱정 마. 지금 잠시 팔았다가 다시 살 거야.] 찰리 잡스의 암 수술은 주가를 폭락시키기도 하지만, 그가 되살아나면서 유작처럼 발표하는 아플폰은 그의 말대로 세상을 바꾸고 역사에 남는다. 그리고 그 시절 아플사의 주식은 날마다 올랐다. “참, 성국아. 넌 바로 한국으로 갈 거야?” “응. 마크, 너는?” “부모님 댁에 가서 크리스마스 같이 보내고 떠나려고.” 그때, 마크가 노트북을 내 눈앞에 들이밀었다. “성국, 이것 봐. 제시랑 타일러 사진 좀 봐. 지금 에펠탑 앞에서 사진 찍은 거지?” [쯧쯧, 전형적인 쇼윈도 커플이네.] “나는 파리 갈 때 이코노미 클래스 증후군 걱정해야 하는데, 적어도 얘들은 비즈니스 타고 갔겠지?” “마크, 우리는 성공해서 전세기 탈 거니까 걱정 마.” “와! 정말 성국, 너는 내가 아는 사람들 중에 제일 자신감이 넘치는 것 같아.” [당연하지, 나 전성국이잖아.] “마크, 제시 염탐 그만하고 어서 자. 나 잔다.” “어, 잘 자. 성국.” 호텔 방의 불이 꺼졌다. 내일 샌프란시스코에서 비행기를 타고 바로 한국으로 향한다. 벌써부터 아빠의 보쌈과 엄마의 김치찌개가 그리웠다. * * * 공항 게이트가 열리자마자 저 멀리 익숙하고도 그리운 실루엣들이 하나둘 나를 반겼다. “혀어어엉!!!” 여전히 공항이 다 떠나가도록 소리 지르는 동생 민국이. 핑크색 패딩을 입고 나를 향해 달려오는 지희. “오빠아아아!!!” 나는 얼른 미친 듯이 달려가서 지희를 안아 들었다. “지희야.” “오빠아!” [나 이렇게 가족들 챙기던 사람 아닌데 말이야. 근데 지희야, 너 좀 많이 무거워졌다.] 아빠가 다가와 얼른 내 짐을 받았다. “성국아, 피곤하지?” “괜찮아, 아빠. 아빠, 지희 왜 이렇게 무거워?” “지희 이제 일곱 살이잖아.” “오빠, 지희 유치원 다녀.” [지희 똑똑한 줄 알았는데, 이제 겨우 유치원에 만족하는 거야? 이 오빠는 유치원 시절에 이미 6개 국어 할 수 있었는데. 지희, 오빠가 공부 좀 시켜야겠는걸. 각오해.] 나는 엄한 눈으로 지희를 쳐다봤다. 여전히 지희는 예쁘지는 않고 귀여웠다. [도대체 우리 집 유전자 어디 간 거니.] “형아, 나 선물. 선물 뭐 사왔어?” “민국아, 영어 공부 열심히 했어?” “아하, 진짜 만나자마자. 형 온 거 실감 난다.” 민국이는 어깨를 출 늘어뜨리더니 갑자기 나에게 안겼다. 엄마가 민국이를 잡아당겼다. “형아, 이제 막 왔잖아. 어서 집에 가자.” “막 왔는데, 또 공부 얘기야. 그래도 형아 와서 좋아! 형아, 어서 집에 가자.” “그래, 가자. 집에.” 나는 왼손에는 민국이를, 오른손에는 지희를 붙잡고 그리운 집으로 향했다. [역시 집이 최고야.]","completion":"Episode 113 We headed to Cupertino, California, where Apple's campus is located. Peter was already spending the end-of-year holidays in California with Grace, so Mark and I set off separately as soon as the semester ended. Mark was visibly excited. Silicon Valley, spread widely around San Francisco, was a paradise for venture companies. \\"Sungguk, I've really only used Apple computers. I really like their perfect system and design.\\" \\"I like them too... But I mainly used products made in South Korea. Don't forget, the laptop you used to develop 'Face Paper' was also from Korea.\\" \\"Sungguk, your patriotism is impressive. Wow, meeting Charlie Jobs in person feels like a dream.\\" I felt the same way. When Charlie Jobs met my grandfather, he had once proposed displaying Apple computers in Samsung Electronics stores. Of course, it didn't happen due to Chairman Jeon Jushin's refusal. \\"Hmm... There's quite a connection with Charlie.\\" Soon, we arrived in front of the Apple campus. The Apple campus, located on a vast site, consisted of several connected off-white buildings. [Where should we go?] While Mark and I were looking around confusedly, Peter waved at us from a distance. \\"Sungguk! Mark!\\" And there, next to Peter, stood the famous Charlie Jobs. [To see Charlie Jobs in person during his lifetime...] I walked over, trying to calm my excited heart. Mark also seemed very nervous. Charlie Jobs greeted us with a pleasant smile and offered a handshake. I quickly took Charlie Jobs' hand. \\"Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you from Peter.\\" \\"I always hear about you, Charlie. The media is full of your stories.\\" \\"Peter was right, you're a really pleasant guy. Is it true you entered Harvard at twelve?\\" \\"It wasn't easy.\\" Charlie Jobs laughed heartily at my words. Soon, he also greeted Mark. \\"A programmer, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"This friend is also amazing. Both of you are Harvard students, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"It seems true that geniuses move the world.\\" \\"Charlie, you're a genius too, right?\\" When Peter asked, Charlie nodded nonchalantly. \\"Of course. Now, let me give you a special tour of Apple.\\" Charlie thoroughly introduced us to the area named the Apple campus. I looked at Charlie walking ahead and tilted my head slightly. No American newspaper had reported on Charlie's battle with cancer or any suspicions. Charlie was wearing baggy pants. Although he tightened them with a belt, anyone could see the pants were more than one size too big. Given Charlie Jobs' personality, wearing clothes that didn't fit perfectly meant he had recently lost a significant amount of weight. Or he was still losing weight. Charlie finished introducing the Apple campus with a smile. \\"Now, who will introduce 'Face Paper' to me?\\" \\"I will. Of course, Mark will explain the technical part.\\" \\"Shall we go to the office?\\" \\"Yes!\\" We followed Charlie to the office. * * * To do a PT for 'Face Paper', the startup Mark and I were founding, in front of Charlie Jobs at Apple's office... Even for someone with a strong heart like me, my heart fluttered slightly. I took a deep breath and started explaining 'Face Paper'. \\"Our goal is 'Simple is the best'. Various SNS are actively operated in many countries even now. However, an SNS that connects people worldwide hasn't appeared yet. The reason is that development was carried out to match the sentiments of each country. But 'Face Paper' is an SNS created by exchanging sentiments between me, an Asian, and Mark, an American. Therefore, it has the greatest advantage of being comfortable and easy for anyone to access and connect with friends.\\" After my PT, Charlie Jobs applauded. \\"I'm curious, what do you think is necessary for 'Face Paper' to become more active in the future?\\" [That would be the Apple phone that Apple will soon release.] I smiled slightly. \\"Charlie, you're going to make it for us in the future.\\" \\"Me?\\" Charlie looked at me puzzled. \\"Apple is going to develop a computer you can carry in your hand, right?\\" Suddenly, Charlie's eyes widened. The release of the iPhone was years away. It was clear they were secretly developing the iPhone now. \\"Sungguk, what do you mean?\\" \\"I've been thinking, seeing the miniaturization of laptops and things like the Apple Pod, that a phone-sized laptop that also functions as a phone could come out within a few years.\\" \\"Is that possible? What about the keyboard?\\" Peter asked, puzzled. \\"You won't need a keyboard. Everything will be solved with a touchscreen. What do you think, Charlie?\\" \\"Hmm... That's cool... A touchscreen...\\" \\"If a phone-sized laptop comes out, this SNS market will grow rapidly worldwide.\\" I spoke confidently. Charlie, stroking his chin, looked at me. \\"Sungguk, you've given me a great inspiration, so I want to give you a gift. Will you accept it? It's nothing big, so you don't have to if you think so.\\" \\"No strings attached?\\" \\"Of course. Today, I received a great inspiration from Sungguk's story.\\" \\"Then, please tell me. I'll decide after hearing it.\\" Charlie smiled slightly and then spoke. \\"Based on what Sungguk said, to captivate people worldwide, the name needs to be simpler. 'Face Paper' is too long. How about 'Face Note'?\\" I looked at Mark. Mark seemed to like the idea. I liked it too, but I didn't show it. \\"Charlie, thank you. I'll discuss it with Mark, my co-founder.\\" \\"Anytime.\\" Then Mark began an enthusiastic explanation about the program. Mark, usually shy, spoke fluently. * * * Although it was about a 3-hour meeting, Charlie and I exchanged ideas. Charlie said goodbye to us with a look of regret. \\"Sungguk, Mark. I'm sorry I can't stay with you until dinner because I have an appointment.\\" \\"Thank you for making time for us.\\" \\"If there's another chance, let's meet again. Take care, Peter. And don't worry about our stock anymore. The products Apple will release in the future will change the world, so there's no way they'll go down.\\" \\"As long as you don't cause any trouble, there's no reason for them to go down. I'll contact you when I get to New York.\\" That's how we parted. I had a slightly sad premonition then. That this meeting with Charlie Jobs might be the last. * * * Peter headed to the accommodation with us. \\"Sungguk, it seems you've given Charlie a huge inspiration. It's really rare for Charlie to give ideas to other people or companies.\\" \\"I'm not sure myself.\\" [It must be about the touchscreen, Peter. Samsung Electronics was also developing it at the time. Apple just released it a bit earlier.] I clenched my fist. \\"By the way, what do you think of the name Charlie suggested? It's more intuitive and has fewer syllables, so I find it convenient.\\" 'Face Note' was indeed convenient. \\"It's easier to pronounce, and it reminds me of exchanging diaries or rolling papers with friends, giving it a more friendly vibe. And what I like the most is the story behind the name 'Face Note' that will probably be talked about by people all over the world.\\" \\"Sungguk, what do you mean?\\" Mark asked. \\"The story of two Harvard students who created 'Face Paper' and the legend of Silicon Valley, Apple's Charlie Jobs, who was inspired by us and suggested the name. I think this story will be widely known after our success...\\" I smiled slightly. \\"Really, you talk and act like someone who's already succeeded. Wake up, Sungguk. We still have a long way to go.\\" \\"Listening to Mark, it seems Sungguk really has a lot in common with Charlie. Even the self-admiration is similar.\\" No matter what they said, it didn't reach my ears. I imagined a page of the future with a content smile. Mark Zuckerberg was known to have created 'Face Paper', but meeting Charlie Jobs, changing its name, and being given a new story was not part of the future I knew. Although minor, the future was indeed changing because of me. * * * As soon as I returned to the hotel, I sold all my Apple stocks. \\"Sungguk, what are you doing? Why are you selling Apple stocks?\\" \\"It seems like they might drop soon.\\" \\"What are you talking about? We just met Charlie Jobs today. The legend of Silicon Valley. According to Charlie Jobs, a product that will change the world will be released soon.\\" [Yeah. But before that, the news of Charlie's cancer surgery will break, causing the stock to plummet. It'll probably happen soon.] I gulped down the milk. \\"Mark, I just hope more people buy Apple stocks during that good fortune period. I also want to invest in something else.\\" \\"You really have some incomprehensible aspects.\\" [Don't worry. I just sold them for now, I'll buy them back later.] Charlie Jobs' cancer surgery would indeed cause the stock to plummet, but as he made a comeback, the iPhone, his posthumous masterpiece, would change the world and make history as he said. And during that era, Apple's stock rose every day. \\"By the way, Sungguk, are you going straight to Korea?\\" \\"Yes. What about you, Mark?\\" \\"I'm going to spend Christmas with my parents before leaving.\\" Then, Mark shoved his laptop in front of me. \\"Sungguk, look at this. Jessie and Tyler's photo. Are they taking pictures in front of the Eiffel Tower now?\\" [Tsk, tsk, typical show-off couple.] \\"I worry about economy class syndrome when I go to Paris, but at least they must have flown business class, right?\\" \\"Mark, we'll succeed and fly private jets, so don't worry.\\" \\"Wow! Really, Sungguk, you seem to have the most confidence among people I know.\\" [Of course, I'm Sungguk.] \\"Mark, stop snooping on Jessie and go to sleep. I'm going to bed.\\" \\"Okay, good night, Sungguk.\\" The lights in the hotel room went out. Tomorrow, I'll take a flight from San Francisco straight to Korea. I was already missing my dad's bossam and my mom's kimchi stew. * * * As soon as the airport gate opened, familiar and missed silhouettes greeted me one by one. \\"Hyeeeeeong!!!\\" My brother Minguk, who still screams loud enough to shake the airport. Jihee, running towards me in a pink padding, shouting. \\"Oppaaaaa!!!\\" I quickly ran and lifted Jihee in my arms. \\"Jihee.\\" \\"Oppa!\\" [I wasn't this family-oriented before. But Jihee, you've gotten quite heavy.] Dad came over and quickly took my luggage. \\"Sungguk, are you tired?\\" \\"I'm okay, dad. Why is Jihee so heavy?\\" \\"Jihee is now seven years old.\\" \\"Oppa, Jihee goes to kindergarten.\\" [Jihee, I thought you were smart, but you're satisfied with just kindergarten? I could speak 6 languages by kindergarten. Jihee, I guess I need to teach you. Be prepared.] I looked at Jihee sternly. Jihee was still not pretty, just cute. [Where did our family's genes go?] \\"Hyung, my gift. What did you bring me?\\" \\"Minguk, did you study English hard?\\" \\"Ah, really. Right after meeting. But it feels real that hyung is here! Hyung, let's go home.\\" \\"Right, let's go. Home.\\" I held Minguk with my left hand and Jihee with my right, heading towards the home I missed. [Home is indeed the best.]"},{"prompt":"teach me TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances LEARNING OBJECTIVE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula.","completion":"Let's dive into understanding the elemental composition of pure substances, focusing on essential knowledge outlined under SPQ-2.A. # SPQ-2.A.1: Composition of Pure Substances Pure substances can be in different forms. They can either be composed of individual molecules, like water (H_2O), where two hydrogen atoms are bonded to one oxygen atom. Others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions, not necessarily forming discreet molecules, but as a formula unit which characterizes ionic compounds. An example of this is table salt, or sodium chloride ((NaCl)), where each sodium ion (Na^+) is chemically bonded to a chloride ion (Cl^-) in a one-to-one ratio within a larger, repeating crystal lattice structure. So, pure substances could be simple individual molecules or a complex arrangement of ions in a crystal lattice, all determined by their chemical formula. # SPQ-2.A.2: Law of Definite Proportions The law of definite proportions is a fundamental principle in chemistry, which states that a chemical compound will always contain its component elements in fixed ratios by mass and does not depend on its source and method of preparation. For example, water will always consist of hydrogen and oxygen in a mass ratio of roughly 1:8. It means that if you were to deconstruct any sample of water from anywhere in the world, no matter the quantity, the mass of the hydrogen would always be about one-eighth the mass of the oxygen present. # SPQ-2.A.3: Empirical Formula The empirical formula of a compound tells us the simplest whole-number ratio of elements within it. Unlike the molecular formula, which indicates the exact number of each type of atom in a molecule, the empirical formula provides a simplified ratio. For instance, the molecular formula of glucose is (C_6H_{12}O_6), but its empirical formula is (CH_2O), reducing the atomic counts to their simplest whole number ratio. Determining the empirical formula involves measuring the masses of each element in a sample of the compound and then converting these masses to moles to find the simplest ratio of the elements. # Learning Objective: Explain the Quantitative Relationship Understanding the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula involves three key steps: 1. **Measuring Element Masses**: First, find out the mass of each element present in a sample of the compound. 2. **Convert Mass to Mole**: Use the atomic masses of the elements (from the periodic table) to convert the mass of each element in the sample to moles. This step is crucial because the chemical behavior of elements is determined by their number of atoms (moles) rather than their mass. 3. **Derive Simplest Ratio**: After converting to moles, calculate the ratios of the elements to each other. The empirical formula is derived by simplifying these ratios to the smallest whole numbers. For example, consider a compound containing 40g of carbon and 10g of hydrogen. The molar mass of carbon is approximately 12g/mol and that of hydrogen is approximately 1g/mol. So, we have about (40 , text{g} div 12 , text{g/mol} = 3.33 , text{mol}) of carbon and (10 , text{g} div 1 , text{g/mol} = 10 , text{mol}) of hydrogen. The simplest whole-number ratio of carbon to hydrogen is roughly 1:3, indicating an empirical formula of (CH_3). By understanding these principles, chemists can determine the basic composition of unknown substances and communicate their findings through empirical formulas, providing insight into the nature of chemical compounds and their interactions."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

One rather amusing, yet transformative, moment in my career involved a project that initially seemed to be leading nowhere. Despite the overwhelming amount of disparate data, I decided to embark on what I now affectionately refer to as \\"The Great Data Expedition\\". This journey saw me sifting through endless arrays of figures, charts, and tables. The turning point came when, almost serendipitously, I uncovered a pattern that had eluded us for weeks. This discovery not only salvaged the project but also significantly enhanced our client's operational efficiency. It was a stark reminder of the beauty and unpredictability inherent in data analysis - no two projects are the same, and therein lies the thrill. It is this blend of challenge, unpredictability, and the joy of discovery that drives me as a professional. **As a Human Being:** Outside the realm of numbers and visualizations, I am a fervent advocate for environmental conservation. This passion translates into spending a considerable amount of my free time in the great outdoors, be it hiking, birdwatching, or participating in local clean-up drives. It's during these moments, amidst the tranquility of nature, that I find my reservoir of creativity and motivation replenished. This connection with nature is not just a hobby but a source of inspiration that permeates my professional endeavors, encouraging a sustainable approach to both life and work. It's a subtle reminder that, in a world governed by data and technology, maintaining a connection with the natural world adds a rich layer of perspective to our human experience. **Regarding Power BI:** What excites me about Power BI is its remarkable ability to democratize data - making it accessible, understandable, and actionable for everyone, regardless of their technical background. This platform transforms raw data into a vivid story, empowering decision-makers with insights that were previously buried in spreadsheets. It's akin to giving voice to the voiceless pieces of data, enabling them to narrate their tales, reveal hidden trends, and inspire strategic decisions. Moreover, Power BI constantly evolves, incorporating AI and machine learning capabilities, which opens new doors for predictive analytics and trend analysis. It’s a tool that not only enhances our understanding of the present but also arms us with the foresight to navigate future challenges. In this sense, Power BI is not just a tool but a gateway to endless possibilities, driving innovation and fostering a culture of informed decision-making."},{"prompt":"Rahul Kotian linkedin.com/in/rahulkotian26 | rahulkotian26@gmail.com | rahulkotian98.github.io/portfolio1 | 680.216.3807 Education Syracuse University School of Information Studies MS in Information System Mumbai University BEng in Computer Engineering May 2023 GPA: 3.67/4.0 October 2020 GPA: 3.3/4.0 Courses: Introduction to Data Science, Project Management, Information System Analysis, Cloud Management, Strategic Management, Enterprise Risk Management, Lean Six Sigma, Big Data and Analytics, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics, Data Warehousing and Mining, Database Management Systems Skills Data Science: Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Data Mining, Topic Modelling, Sentiment Analysis, Supervised/ Unsupervised Learning, and Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PySpark, Tensorflow, NLTK, Matplotlib, Plotly) Technologies: SQL, Python, R, Kaizen, Selenium, Bloomberg, Jira, ANOVA, Matlab, Git/GitHub Business Analytics: Excel, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, SSAS, Report Designer BI, Alteryx, SAS Experience Data Analyst | Dynamic Sustainability Lab July 2022 - May 2023 • Conducted comprehensive analysis on more than 150 energy measurement points within a 2.11 billion enterprise utilizing Power BI, Report Designer BI, and EnergyCAP. • Initiated the creation of an advanced Power BI dashboard, integrating diverse data sources, conducting Data Mining and Data Wrangling, crafting custom visualizations, and providing ongoing updates to senior leadership. • Orchestrated the implementation of an innovative energy resource tracking system leveraging Power BI and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), with a projected 15% reduction in energy usage.

[이래서 애 보느니 차라리 일한다는 거구나….] * * * “와, 김치찌개. 와, 보쌈.” 눈앞에 그토록 그리던 김치찌개와 보쌈이 놓여 있었다. “잘 먹겠습니다!” 나는 허겁지겁 엄마의 김치찌개와 아빠의 보쌈을 먹었다. [역시 이 맛이야!] “성국아, 천천히 먹어.” 엄마가 나를 말렸지만, 들을 생각이 없었다. [엄마, 나 말리지 마. 얼마나 먹고 싶었는데….] 아빠도 걱정스레 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 갑자기 매운 거 많이 먹으면 탈 날 수 있어. 천천히 먹어.” “네에.” 나는 건성으로 대답하고 보쌈을 입에 욱여넣었다. 저번 생의 유학 생활이야 풍족하다 못해 복에 겨운 수준이라 김치며 보쌈 같은 거 편하게 먹었다. 이번 생에서는 학교 근처 한식당이 있기는 했지만, 비싸서 자주 갈 수는 없었다. “오빠, 물.” 지희가 얼른 내 곁으로 물을 건넸다. “고마워, 지희야.” 나는 지희의 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 겨울방학 동안 뭐 할 거야?” 아빠가 일부러 말을 걸었다. [좀 배가 부르네….] 나는 천천히 밥을 먹기 시작했다. “JP 가서 연습생 하게, 아빠.” “그래, 이제야 네 또래답네. 그런 음악도 많이 듣고, 거기 가면 또래 친구들도 많이 사귀겠다. 그치?” [연습생 하겠다는데, 반기는 집은 우리 집뿐이라고.] 엄마도 반겼다. “어머, 성국아. 거기 ‘저스트’ 만든 회사지? 범선이는 잘 지내나 몰라.” [응. 효진 그룹 구예정이랑 아주 잘 만나고 있어.] 엄마는 여전히 해체된 그룹 ‘저스트’의 팬이었다. “이제는 걸 그룹이랑 더 어린 보이 그룹 만든대요. 전 그냥 연습생 신분으로 지내다 가려고요.” “형아, 형아. 거기 나도 데리고 가면 안 돼? 나도 오디션 보면 안 돼?” “넌 너무 어려서 안 돼.” “몇 살이면 돼?” “초등학교는 마치고 생각해보자.” [민국아, 괜히 계약 꼬이면 빼오기 귀찮으니까, 형아가 회사 차릴 때까지 기다리고 있어.] 엄마도 민국이를 달랬다. “그래, 민국아. 초등학교는 졸업하고 그때 생각해보자.” “아하, 싫어, 싫어. 형은 공부하러 초등학교도 때려치우고 미국 갔잖아.” “전민국!” 아빠의 엄한 목소리가 들렸다. 나는 태어나서 단 한 번도 들어본 적 없는 목소리였다. [아빠, 무섭게 왜 그래?] 민국이는 잔뜩 삐친 얼굴로 식탁에 앉았다. “형이야 당연히 공부하러 간 거니까 그렇지. 너는 학생이 공부는 맨날 안 하고, 그러면서 무슨 가수가 된다고 그래? 요즘 가수들 보면 공부도 다 잘해서 좋은 대학 다니잖아.” “치, 맨날 나만 뭐래.” 민국이가 제대로 사춘기가 오는 모양이었다. [이럴 땐 형인 내가 나서야지.] “민국아, 형이 JP 연습생 하면서 한번 동생 데리고 와도 되냐고 물어볼게.” “진짜, 형?” “진짜지. 근데 회사에서 싫어할 수도 있어서 장담 못 해. 형이 물어볼 때까지 공부 열심히 하고 있을 거지?” “응! 형!” 아빠가 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “얘는 도대체 누구 닮아서 이렇게 공부를 안 하는지 몰라. 유치원 다니는 지희도 맨날 책 읽는데….” “자기야, 민국이 그만 혼내. 자기 요즘 민국이만 혼내는 것 같아.” “맞아!” 민국이는 대차게 반응했다. 나는 민국이를 찬찬히 살폈다. 나 닮아서 키도 또래보다 컸고, 얼굴도 봐줄 만했다. [역시 우리 집 유전자 어디 안 갔네. 정신연령만 키우면 되겠어.] “성국아, 어서 밥 먹어.” “응, 엄마.” 나는 보쌈을 매운 김치에 싸서 한 입에 밀어 넣었다. 와그작. 와그작. 몇 번 씹어 넘겼는데… 그 순간, 견딜 수 없는 통증이 밀려왔다. [왜 이러지?] 나는 배를 안고 그대로 화장실로 뛰어 들어갔다. * * * 화장실 밖에서는 엄마, 아빠가 걱정하는 목소리가 들렸다. “그러게 매운 거 너무 갑자기 많이 먹는다 싶었어. 성국아, 괜찮아.” [아, 안… 괜찮.] “소영아, 약국 가서 약 사올게.” “어, 빨리 다녀와.” 이 와중에 민국이와 지희는 화장실 문 앞에서 문을 두드리고 난리를 피웠다. “형아, 괜찮아? 내가 도와줄까?” “오빠. 오빠. 마이 아파?” [이것들아. 이럴 땐 모른 척해주는 게 도와주는 거야.] 꾸륵. * * * 엄마가 내 배를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 이제 좀 괜찮아?” “어…. 엄마.” 나는 정말 몸 안에 음식물이라고는 하나도 남기지 않고 모두 다 쏟아냈다. 그러곤 화장실 앞에서 장렬히 쓰러졌다. 약을 사온 아빠가 나를 업고는 침대에 겨우 옮겼고, 민국이와 지희가 돕겠다며 고사리손으로 내 팔과 다리를 들었다. [정말 한국 온 첫날부터 모양 안 살게…. 흑.] 나는 이를 꽉 깨물었다. “성국아, 학교 다닐 때 밥은 잘 챙겨 먹는 거야?” “응, 잘 먹고 다녀.” “저번에 아빠가 그러시던데, 30달러로 한 달 살기 했다며? 그때, 몸 많이 상한 거 아니야?” “오늘 갑자기 매운 거 먹어서 그래. 걱정 마, 엄마.” “정말, 고집은 누굴 닮아 이렇게 센 거니.” [누구겠어. 엄마, 아빠 닮았겠지.] 엄마의 따뜻한 손이 배를 문질문질하니 갑자기 어릴 적이 떠올랐다. 엄마가 이렇게 배를 문질문질해 주면 막 종알종알 이 일 저 일 참견하다가도 까무룩 잠들곤 했는데…. 그때가 참 좋았는데…. * * * “성국아, 성국아. 오늘부터 JP에 연습하러 간다고 하지 않았어?” “엄마, 몇 시야?” “8시. 근데 너 몸 괜찮아?” 나는 몸을 벌떡 세웠다. 간만에 푹 잤더니 몸이 새털처럼 가벼웠다. “엄마, 나 완전 괜찮은데.” “하루 정도 푹 쉬면 안 될까? 엄마가 담당자한테 전화해줄까. 엄마도 SKJ 엔터테인먼트 이사잖아.” [헬리콥터맘은 사양할게, 엄마.] 나는 얼른 욕실로 향했다. “엄마, 괜찮은 거 같아. 나가보고 몸 안 좋으면 말하고 오늘은 일찍 올게.” “절대 무리하면 안 돼.” 욕실 문을 잡아당기려는 순간, 민국이가 내 앞에 와서 서더니 주위를 의미심장하게 둘러봤다. 그러곤 나에게 초콜릿 한 봉지를 내밀었다. “형아, 연습하다 힘들 때 먹어.” “민국아, 이거 뇌물이지?” “형아, 뇌물이 뭐야?” [민국이 녀석, 공부 안 했구나.] 나는 민국이의 어깨를 탁 잡았다. “이거 먹고 얼른 JP에 데려다 달라고 주는 거지?” “히이. 들켰네, 형. 그래도 내가 제일 아끼는 초콜릿이야.” [이 녀석, 어디서든 굶어 죽진 않겠어.] 나는 초콜릿을 받았다. “형도 회사에 적응해야 하니까, 빨리는 못 물어봐. 기다리면서 공부 좀 하고 있어.” “응, 형아!” 민국이는 천진난만하게 미소를 지었다. * * * 똑. 똑. 작업실 문을 열고 들어가자, 방무혁이 반가운 얼굴로 나를 반겼다. “성국아! 어서 와.” “잘 지내셨어요?” “나야 잘 지냈지. 나 너 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 보는 재미에 푹 빠져서 지냈어. 미국 방송에도 출연하고, 대단하던데….” “그냥 운이 좀 좋았어요.” “운이 아니라, 네가 기회를 만드는 것 같던데…. 참, 이따가 식사하면서 천천히 이야기하고, 오늘부터 JP 연습생으로 지낼 거니까 스케줄 알려줄게.” 방무혁은 자리에서 일어나 작업실을 나섰다. “우선 오늘은 간단한 테스트를 할 거야. 보컬, 댄스 그런 능력이 지금 어느 정도인지 테스트하는 거야.” 나는 작게 고개를 끄덕였다. “그리고 1년 차 연습생들 있거든. 그 애들한테 인사하는 것으로 오늘 일정은 끝. 1년 차 연습생들은 네 나이부터 시작해서 성인까지 다양하게 있어.” “네.” “그럼, 보컬 테스트를 진행해 볼 건데… 우리 JP 보컬 선생님 중에서 제일 능력자셔. 이분이 찍은 애들 중에 데뷔 못 한 애가 없어.” 나는 살짝 목을 풀면서 보컬 연습하는 공간으로 향했다. 방음벽으로 둘러싸인 작은 방들이 한 층에 쭉 있었다. 방무혁은 세 번째 방 문을 두드리더니 문을 열었다. 짧은 머리에 카리스마 가득한 얼굴의 한소리가 나를 반겼다. “네가 그 유명한 성국이구나. 네 이야기 많이 들었어. 와, 실물로 보니까 더 잘생겼네. 너 진짜 얼굴은 바로 데뷔해도 될 것 같아.” “소리 씨, 우선 보컬 테스트부터 해주세요. 이 친구 보컬이니 댄스니 아무것도 해본 적도 없어요.” “정말요? 여러 기획사에서 탐낼 얼굴인데…. 이리 들어와봐.” 방무혁이 지켜보는 가운데, 나는 보컬 트레이닝룸으로 불리는 방으로 들어갔다. 한소리는 건반 앞에 앉더니 음계를 쭉 쳤다. “음악 시간에 노래 부르는 것처럼 편하게 부르면 돼. 긴장할 거 없어.” “네….” [별거 아니네.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 미국에서 고등학교를 다니면서, 음악 수업을 좋아하진 않았지만 실기 평가에서 나쁜 성적을 받은 적은 없었다. 솔직히 예체능은 타고나는 재능의 영역이었다. 그 재능으로 실기 평가를 보는 것 자체가 부당하다고 내가 건의해서 모든 예체능 선생님들은 학생의 노력 여부를 실기 평가에서 굉장히 중요하게 봤다. 물론 난 노력이라면 누구 못지않았다. 한소리가 건반 음계를 하나씩 쳤다. “잘 들어봐. 이게 도. 이게 레… 들었지?” “네.” “우선 낮은 도부터 높은 도까지 올라가보자.” “도레미파솔라시도.” 나는 필 충만하게 불렀다. 한소리가 고개를 갸웃했다. “혹시 연습한 노래 있니?” “‘저스트’의 <거짓이야> 연습했어요.” “그래. 그럼 그 노래 앞부분만 좀 해보자.” “네!” 나는 이번에도 자신만만하게 대답하고 노래를 시작했다. [이거야 완전 껌이지. 내가 이 노래를 두 돌 때부터 듣고 자랐다고. 한소리 선생, 이 노래 내가 ‘저스트’한테 직접 골라준 거야.] “그만.” [한 소절도 제대로 못 불렀는데, 그만두라고?] 한소리는 고개를 갸웃하더니, 방무혁을 쳐다봤다. “피디님, 평소대로 말해도 되죠? 얘 무슨 특별 대우 받고 그런 거 아니죠?” “그렇긴 한데… 살살 해요. 성국이는 방학 동안만 연습하고 또 미국 들어갈 거예요.” “살살하긴요. JP 연습생 되려는 애들이 얼마나 많은데, 체험이라고 우습게 보면 안 되죠.” “선생님, 편하게 말씀해 주세요.” 나는 공손하게 앞 손을 모으고 말했다. “그래, 성국아. 이게 네 앞날을 결정하는 데도 도움 될 거야. 솔직히 난 네 외모 보고 너무 마음에 들었거든. 이건 뭐, 바로 데뷔해도 될 만한 외모잖아. 근데, 노래 듣는 순간… 진짜 사람은 겉만 봐서는 알 수가 없구나, 이 생각이 드는 거야.” [한소리 선생, 말을 너무 꼬아 하네! 어? 내가 누군 줄 알아?] 나는 화를 꾹 눌렀다. “솔직히 이 정도 실력으로 연습생 체험해 보겠다는 거, 다른 애들한테 미안하지 않니?” “한소리 선생님, 살살 해요.” 오히려 방무혁이 말렸다. “너, 연습은 하고 온 거야?” “네, 많이 듣고 많이 연습했습니다.” “근데 도대체 왜 이 모양이지….” [이 모양이라니? 도대체 내 모양이 어때서? 내가 어때서!] 한소리는 한숨을 푹 내쉬었다. “방 피디님, 솔직히 이야기할게요. 얘 그냥 음치예요.” 태어나서 처음 들어보는 모욕이었다. 나는 지금 아이큐 121 이후로 가장 큰 좌절을 겪고 있었다. 얼굴이 감당할 수 없이 붉으락푸르락해졌다. 날 보더니 한소리가 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 내가 말을 너무 세게 했지?” [흑… 나 완전 상처받았다고!]","completion":"Episode 114 \\"Sungguk, take a rest. Mom, Dad, and I will prepare dinner.\\" \\"Okay. Mom.\\" I opened the door. Though it had been a few months, home was still the most comfortable place. Just as I was about to throw myself onto the bed. \\"Brother!!!!!!\\" \\"Oppa!!!!!!\\" Minguk and Jihee jumped on me. Jihee was holding dolls in both hands, and Minguk had boxing gloves in his. \\"Brother, let's box.\\" \\"Oppa, play dolls with Jihee. You do this.\\" [Ah, I'm really home.] Dark circles were forming under my eyes. I was playing with them, one hand in a boxing glove, the other holding a doll. Minguk kept throwing punches at my hand. \\"One, two. One, two.\\" \\"Oppa, let's go drink tea.\\" Jihee kept feeding invisible tea to her dolls. [So this is why they say it's better to work than to take care of kids...] * * * \\"Wow, kimchi stew. Wow, bossam.\\" The long-missed kimchi stew and bossam were in front of me. \\"I'll enjoy the meal!\\" I devoured Mom's kimchi stew and Dad's bossam. [This is the taste!] \\"Sungguk, eat slowly.\\" Mom tried to stop me, but I had no intention of listening. [Mom, don't stop me. I've been wanting to eat this so much...] Dad also looked at me worriedly. \\"Sungguk, if you eat spicy food all of a sudden, you might get sick. Eat slowly.\\" \\"Yes.\\" I answered perfunctorily and stuffed bossam into my mouth. My previous life's study abroad was so affluent that I could easily eat kimchi and bossam. There was a Korean restaurant near school in this life, but it was too expensive to go often. \\"Oppa, water.\\" Jihee quickly brought water to me. \\"Thanks, Jihee.\\" I patted Jihee's head. \\"Sungguk, what are you going to do during the winter break?\\" Dad deliberately started a conversation. [I'm a bit full...] I started to eat slowly. \\"I'll go to JP and become a trainee, Dad.\\" \\"That's right, now you're acting your age. Listen to a lot of music there, and you'll make a lot of friends your age, right?\\" [The only house that welcomes me becoming a trainee is ours.] Mom was also pleased. \\"Oh my, Sungguk. That's the company that made 'Just', right? I wonder how Beomseon is doing.\\" [Yeah. He's meeting with Gu Yejeong of Hyojin Group.] Mom was still a fan of the disbanded group 'Just'. \\"Now they're making a girl group and a younger boy group. I'm just going to stay as a trainee.\\" \\"Brother, brother. Can you take me there too? Can I audition?\\" \\"You're too young.\\" \\"How old do I have to be?\\" \\"Let's think about it after you finish elementary school.\\" [Minguk, it'd be annoying to pull you out if the contract gets tangled, so wait until your brother starts a company.] Mom also comforted Minguk. \\"Right, Minguk. Let's think about it after you graduate elementary school.\\" \\"Ah, no, no. Brother went to study in the US without even finishing elementary school.\\" \\"Jeon Minguk!\\" Dad's stern voice rang out. It was a voice I had never heard in my life. [Dad, why are you so scary?] Minguk sat at the table with a sulky face. \\"Brother went to study, of course. You're a student who doesn't study, and you want to become a singer? These days, singers are also good at studying and go to good universities.\\" \\"Chi, always nagging at me.\\" Minguk seemed to be hitting puberty properly. [This is when I, as a brother, should step in.] \\"Minguk, if I become a JP trainee, I'll ask if I can bring my brother.\\" \\"Really, brother?\\" \\"Really. But the company might not like it, so I can't promise. You'll study hard until I ask, right?\\" \\"Yep! Brother!\\" Dad shook his head. \\"I don't know who he takes after, not studying at all. Jihee reads books every day even though she's in kindergarten....\\" \\"Honey, stop scolding Minguk. It seems like you're only scolding him these days.\\" \\"That's right!\\" Minguk reacted vehemently. I looked at Minguk carefully. He was taller than his peers, taking after me, and his face was decent. [Our family's genes didn't go anywhere. Just need to raise his mental age.] \\"Sungguk, eat your food.\\" \\"Okay, Mom.\\" I wrapped bossam in spicy kimchi and shoved it into my mouth. Crunch. Crunch. After a few bites... suddenly, an unbearable pain surged. [Why is this happening?] I ran to the bathroom, clutching my stomach. * * * Outside the bathroom, I could hear Mom and Dad's worried voices. \\"I told you, eating spicy food all of a sudden was a bad idea. Sungguk, are you okay?\\" [Ah, not... okay.] \\"So-young, I'll go buy some medicine from the pharmacy.\\" \\"Oh, hurry back.\\" Even in this situation, Minguk and Jihee were banging on the bathroom door, causing a commotion. \\"Brother, are you okay? Should I help?\\" \\"Oppa. Oppa. Does it hurt a lot?\\" [You guys. This is when you pretend not to know to help.] Gurgle. * * * Mom was rubbing my stomach. \\"Sungguk, do you feel a bit better now?\\" \\"Yeah... Mom.\\" I had emptied my stomach of all its contents. Then I collapsed heroically in front of the bathroom. Dad, who had bought medicine, barely managed to carry me to bed, and Minguk and Jihee tried to help by lifting my arms and legs. [Really, what a start to my first day back in Korea... Sigh.] I clenched my teeth. \\"Sungguk, did you eat well while at school?\\" \\"Yeah, I ate well.\\" \\"Dad said you lived on 30 for a month once? Didn't that hurt your body?\\" \\"It's just because I suddenly ate something spicy today. Don't worry, Mom.\\" \\"Really, who did you get this stubbornness from?\\" [Who else? I must have gotten it from Mom and Dad.] Mom's warm hand rubbing my stomach suddenly reminded me of my childhood. When Mom rubbed my stomach like this, I would chatter about this and that and eventually fall asleep.... Those were good times.... * * * \\"Sungguk, Sungguk. Weren't you supposed to start practicing at JP from today?\\" \\"Mom, what time is it?\\" \\"8 o'clock. But are you okay?\\" I sat up quickly. After a good night's sleep, my body felt as light as a feather. \\"Mom, I'm totally fine.\\" \\"Can't you rest for just one day? I'll call the person in charge for you. I'm also a director at SKJ Entertainment.\\" [I'll pass on the helicopter mom, Mom.] I hurried to the bathroom. \\"Mom, I think I'm okay. I'll go and if I feel bad, I'll tell them and come home early today.\\" \\"Absolutely no overdoing it.\\" As I reached for the bathroom door, Minguk came in front of me and looked around meaningfully. Then he handed me a bag of chocolate. \\"Brother, eat this when you're tired during practice.\\" \\"Minguk, is this a bribe?\\" \\"Brother, what's a bribe?\\" [Minguk, you haven't studied.] I grabbed Minguk's shoulder. \\"Are you giving this to me so I'll quickly ask JP to take you?\\" \\"Hehe. You caught me, brother. But it's my favorite chocolate.\\" [This kid, he won't starve anywhere.] I accepted the chocolate. \\"Brother also needs to adapt to the company, so I can't ask right away. You'll study hard while waiting, right?\\" \\"Yep, brother!\\" Minguk smiled innocently. * * * Knock. Knock. As I entered the practice room, Bang Muhyuk greeted me with a welcoming face. \\"Sungguk! Welcome.\\" \\"Have you been well?\\" \\"I've been good. I've been enjoying watching your 'Face Paper'. Appearing on American shows, you're amazing...\\" \\"It was just good luck.\\" \\"It's not luck, you seem to create your own opportunities.... Anyway, let's talk over dinner later, and since you're starting as a JP trainee today, I'll let you know the schedule.\\" Bang Muhyuk stood up and left the practice room. \\"First, we'll do a simple test today. We'll test your current level of vocal and dance abilities.\\" I nodded slightly. \\"And there are first-year trainees here. You'll greet them, and that will be the end of today's schedule. The first-year trainees range from your age to adults.\\" \\"Okay.\\" \\"Then, we'll proceed with the vocal test... Our JP vocal teacher is the best. There hasn't been a trainee they've trained who hasn't debuted.\\" I loosened my throat slightly and headed to the vocal training space. Small rooms surrounded by soundproof walls lined one floor. Bang Muhyuk knocked on the third room's door and opened it. Han Sori, with short hair and full of charisma, welcomed me. \\"So you're the famous Sungguk. I've heard a lot about you. Wow, you're even more handsome in person. You could debut right now with that face.\\" \\"Sori, please start with the vocal test. This kid hasn't tried singing or dancing before.\\" \\"Really? With a face that many agencies would covet.... Come in.\\" Under Bang Muhyuk's watch, I entered the room known as the vocal training room. Han Sori sat in front of the keyboard and played a scale. \\"Just sing comfortably like you would in music class. No need to be nervous.\\" \\"Okay...\\" [This is nothing.] I shrugged my shoulders. During my high school years in the US, although I didn't particularly enjoy music classes, I never received a bad grade in practical exams. Honestly, arts and physical education were realms of innate talent. It was unfair to be evaluated on such talents, and I had suggested that all arts and physical education teachers should consider the student's effort very important in practical exams. Of course, I was second to none when it came to effort. Han Sori played the keyboard scale one note at a time. \\"Listen carefully. This is do. This is re... You heard it, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Let's start from the low do and go up to the high do.\\" \\"Do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do.\\" I sang with full enthusiasm. Han Sori tilted her head. \\"Do you have a song you've practiced?\\" \\"I practiced 'Just's <It's a Lie>.\\" \\"Then, let's hear just the beginning of that song.\\" \\"Okay!\\" I confidently started singing the song. [This is a piece of cake. I've been listening to this song since I was two. Han Sori, I personally picked this song for 'Just'.] \\"Stop.\\" [I haven't even finished a verse, and you're telling me to stop?] Han Sori looked puzzled and then glanced at Bang Muhyuk. \\"PD-nim, can I speak frankly? This kid isn't getting any special treatment, right?\\" \\"Well, kind of... But go easy. Sungguk is only practicing during the vacation and then going back to the US.\\" \\"Go easy? There are so many kids who want to become JP trainees, we can't take this lightly just because it's an experience.\\" \\"Teacher, please speak comfortably.\\" I politely clasped my hands in front of me. \\"Alright, Sungguk. This will also help determine your future. Honestly, I really liked your appearance. This is a face that could debut right now. But the moment I heard you sing... I realized you can't judge a person just by their appearance.\\" [Han Sori, you're speaking too cryptically! What? Do you know who I am?] I suppressed my anger. \\"Honestly, with this level of skill, don't you feel sorry for the other kids who want to experience being a trainee?\\" \\"Han Sori, please go easy.\\" Bang Muhyuk intervened. \\"Did you practice before coming here?\\" \\"Yes, I listened and practiced a lot.\\" \\"But why does it look like this...\\" [What do you mean by 'this'? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me!] Han Sori sighed deeply. \\"Bang PD-nim, I'll be honest. This kid is tone-deaf.\\" It was the first time in my life I had heard such an insult. I was experiencing the biggest frustration since learning my IQ was 121. My face turned red with embarrassment. Seeing me, Han Sori smiled slightly. \\"Sungguk, did I speak too harshly?\\" [I'm totally hurt!]"},{"prompt":"[흑… 나 완전 상처받았다고!]","completion":"[I'm totally hurt!]"},{"prompt":"give me cool street wear design ideas and names","completion":"Creating a streetwear brand involves not just crafting designs that are visually appealing but also embodying a unique narrative or concept that resonates with a particular community or culture.

[머리, 가슴, 골반, 배….] 나는 순서를 떠올리며 머리부터 유연하게 웨이브를 하는데. “성국아! 머리, 가슴, 골반. 배라고!” “그, 그렇게 했는데요.” 이서린이 웃음을 터트렸다. “너는 지금 한 덩어리가 움직이잖아. 웨이브는 정확하게 머리, 가슴, 배. 이렇게 몸 부분, 부분이 움직여야 하는 거야.” [내가 레고도 아니고 어떻게 몸이 그렇게 따로 움직이나, 이 선생.] 큭. 뒤에서 지켜보던 방무혁이 웃음을 참는 소리가 들렸다. [다들 너무하네. 너무해.] 그래도 이서린은 한소리만큼 무섭지는 않았다. “성국아, 처음에 오면 다들 이래. 너무 걱정하지 마, 앞으로 나만 잘 따라오면 잘할 수 있을 거야. 가능성이 보여.” “네, 선생님.” 나는 미친 듯이 쏟아지는 땀을 닦았다. * * * 가창 D 댄스 D- [뭐야, 이 선생. 가능성 있다고 하고는 한 선생보다 더 점수 짜게 줬잖아! 역시 사람은 믿으면 안 돼.] 나는 황망한 얼굴로 성적표를 받아 들었다. 난생처음 보는 D라니…. 정신이 혼미해지는 느낌이었다. “방 피디님, 제 성적이 연습생들 중에서 어느 정도 되는 건가요? 이 정도 점수 받고도 데뷔한 연습생 있나요?” “솔직히 말할게. 충격 먹지 마.” [이 상황에 더 먹을 충격이 남아 있다고?] 눈 밑 다크서클이 땅까지 닿는 느낌이었다. “솔직히 연습생 중에 이 점수는 못 본 것 같아. 그래도 둘 중 하나는 다들 뛰어나니까 연습생으로 캐스팅되거든. 성국이야 외모가 워낙 좋잖아. 근데 내가 여러 연습생 봐온 결과, 가장 중요한 건 정말 노력이야. 음치도 고칠 수 있고, 몸치도 충분히 아이돌 가능해.” “위로 감사해요.” 방무혁이 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “위로 아니고 진짜. 네가 예전에 예진이란 애 탈락시켜야 할까, 말까 고민할 때 우리한테 그런 말 했잖아. 그룹에는 뛰어난 멤버도 필요하지만, 주변 멤버들과 잘 섞이는 튀지 않는 멤버도 필요하다고.” [내가 그런 주옥같은 말을 했었구나.] “이제 연습생 1년 차들한테 인사하러 가자. 노래는 개인적으로 레슨 계속 받겠지만, 댄스는 앞으로는 이 친구들이랑 함께할 거야. 다들 회의실에 모여 있을 테니까, 가보자.” “네, 피디님. 근데 혹시… 저에 대해서 알까요?” “내가 그냥 미국에서 학교 다니는 친구인데, 방학 동안 연습생으로 들어올 거란 말만 했어.” “그냥 그 정도로만 우선 소개해 주셨으면 해서요.” “부담스러워서 그래? 아마 초록창에 네 이름 검색하면 연관 기사들 뜰 건데. 최근 사진들도 좀 뜰 수도 있고.” “그때 알면 말하고요. 그 전까지는 저도 좀 평범한 10대 친구처럼 지내고 싶어서요. 또래 친구들도 사귀고요.” “그래, 알았어.” * * * 회의실 문이 열리자, 아홉 명 정도의 남녀가 섞여 앉아 있었다. 어린 친구는 내 또래부터 시작해서 성인으로 보이는 연습생도 있었다. 방무혁은 연습생들에게 나를 소개했다. “여기는 오늘부터 같이 연습할 전성국이라고, 내가 일전에 말했지? 미국에서 학교 다니는데, 방학이라 특별히 들어왔어. 성국아, 인사하자.” “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다. 잘 부탁드려요.” 박수 소리가 들리더니, 곧 아이들이 웅성거리는 소리가 들렸다. “대박, 남자 연습생 중에 얼굴 1등 아니야?” [이봐, 그 얘기 다 들린다고.] 그래도 얼굴 1등이라니 앞서 받은 가창과 댄스의 최하위 점수에 충격받은 마음이 좀 위로되는 느낌이었다. “궁금한 거 있으면 자유롭게 질문해.” 방무혁의 말에 여기저기서 질문이 터져 나왔다. 그러자 방무혁이 얼른 중재를 했다. “다들 엄청 궁금하구나. 그냥 시계 방향으로 하나씩 질문하자. 자, 정미부터.” “몇 살이세요?” “한국 나이로 열네 살 돼요.” “와, 키가 얼마예요?” “정확히는 모르는데… 175cm 정도 될 거예요.” “미국 어디에서 학교 다녀요?” “매사추세츠 캠브리지요.” “무슨 양복 광고 같잖아.” 남자애들이 키득거렸다. 다음으로 얼굴이 유독 하얀 여학생이 질문했다. “특기가 뭐예요?” “전 얼굴이요.” 그 순간, 회의실이 웃음으로 터져 나갔다. “푸하하하.” “얼굴이 특기래.” “완전 웃겨!” [다들 왜 이러지? 사실을 말한 건데…. 이상하네.] * * * “성국아, 본격적인 연습은 내일부터 시작하자. 근데 연습생들 다들 너 잘 모르나 봐. <다섯 남자와 아기 바구니> 전성국을 모르나….” “그 프로 할 때 다들 저랑 같이 기어 다니고 있었을 텐데요. 많아야 아장아장 걷고요.” “그렇긴 하지. 나이는 나만 먹나 봐. 배 많이 고프지?” “조금이요.” “내가 만나야 할 가수가 있어서. 잠깐 이야기하고 올 테니까, 조금만 여기서 기다려.” “네.” 나는 연습실 사이에 마련된 휴식 공간에 잠시 앉았다. 휴식 공간에는 JP를 통해서 데뷔한 가수들의 앨범과 브로마이드, 사인 같은 것들이 쭉 나열되어 있었다. 그중에 ‘저스트’가 당연 중심이었다. 꼬르륵. 이때, 아침에 민국이가 주머니에 밀어 넣은 초콜릿이 떠올랐다. 나는 얼른 초콜릿을 꺼내서 몇 알 먹었다. “저기….” 누가 뒤에서 조용히 나를 부르는 소리가 들렸다. 누구지? 뒤돌아보니 아까 회의실에서 본 얼굴이 유독 하얀 여학생과 그 옆에 앉아 있었던 여학생 두 명이 초롱초롱한 눈으로 나를 보고 있었다. “안녕, 난 이유미야.” “안녕, 난 서진아야.” 얼굴이 하얀 쪽이 이유미. 그 옆이 서진아였다. [둘 다 나중에 무슨 그룹에서 보게 되었던 것도 같고….] 나는 고개를 갸웃했다. 데뷔조로 뽑힌 이후에는 얼굴이 계속 업그레이드되기 때문에 솔직히 지금으로는 알아보기 힘들었다. 데뷔할 때 본명을 쓰는 경우도 많았지만, 예명을 많이 쓰기도 했고. 저번 생에서 어느 순간 걸 그룹은 펑클과 SOS 이후로 탈덕해서 아주 유명한 그룹 외에는 별로 기억이 없었다. 간혹 아이돌 출신 배우들은 만나기는 했지만. “어, 안녕.” “성국아, 우리 둘 다 너랑 동갑이야. 이번에 다 열네 살 될 거거든. 중학교 입학해.” [그래서, 어쩌자고? 말 놓자고? 머리에 피도 안 마른 것들이.] 나는 대답 대신 입을 꾹 다물었다. 확실히 초등학교 1학년 중퇴 이후로 내 또래와 어울릴 일이 없어서인지 요즘 중딩들의 사회화된 행동이 뭔지 좀 헷갈렸다. “어, 반가워.” [이 정도면 적당한가. 아닌가. 아, 맞다. 애들은 먹을 거 주면 좋아하지.] 나는 초콜릿을 내밀었다. “초콜릿 먹을래? 내 동생이 준 거야. 배고플 때 먹으라고.” [초딩 때는 이거면 다 통했는데.] “우리는 다이어트 중이라서. 미안.” 서진아가 새침하게 대답했다. [흠, 실패네.] 확실히 또래가 더 대하기 어려웠다. 미국에서는 마크와 데니스, 제시를 비롯해서 나보다 나이 많은 친구들과 어울려서 나도 굳이 실제 나이처럼 굴지 않고 어른스럽게 지냈기 때문이다. 이유미가 호기심 가득한 눈으로 물었다. “성국아, 너 그럼 미국에서 얼마나 산 거야?” “한 5년 정도.” 아홉 살에 넘어갔으니 딱 5년 좀 넘었다. “와, 너 영어 정말 잘하겠다. 피디님이 영어 공부하라는데, 너무 어려워.” [네가 머리가 나쁜가 보지.] 이유미는 좀 징징거렸다. [징징 이유미. 새침 서진아. 나이는 동갑.] 나는 머릿속으로 두 사람의 캐릭터를 입력했다. “너희는 여기서 영어 레슨도 받아?” “응. 영어 레슨, 연기 레슨 다 받아. 성국아, 넌 영어 공부 안 해도 돼서 좋겠다.” 이때, 지나가는 여자 연습생과 남자 연습생들이 모여들기 시작했다. “와, 특기가 얼굴? 이 친구야?” “한 번에 알아보겠어. 진짜 잘생겼다. 키도 엄청 커!” [이놈의 인기란…. ] 여기서도 나는 모두의 관심을 끌었다. “너, 미국에서 왔으면 거기서는 영화에서 보면 막 우리 나이 때 연애도 많이 하잖아. 너도 여자 친구 있어? 금발에 파란 눈?” “영화는 영화일 뿐이에요.” [이번 생에서 나는 순결한 모태솔로라고.] 키가 큰 남학생이 나를 보며 웃었다. 무쌍에 눈이 가늘게 찢어진 것이 일명 JP상이었지만, 좀 싸가지가 없어 보였다. “야, 영화는 무슨 영화일 뿐이야. 너 거기서는 동양인이라 왕따라서 친구 없는 거지?” [나는 관대하다. 나는 전성국이니까….] 나는 속으로 마인드 컨트롤을 시작했다. “저, 친구 있어요. 근데 아직 연애는 안 해요. 관심이 없어서요.” “치, 꼭 이런 애들이 나중에 여자 문제로 사고 쳐요.” [나는 관대하다. 나는 전성국이고 마흔 살이니까….] 여자 연습생이 키 큰 남학생을 말렸다. “건주야, 그만해. 넌 꼭 잘생긴 애들 새로 들어오면 놀리더라.” “난 외국물 먹었다고 으스대는 애들 정말 싫거든. 너, 영어는 제대로 해? 코리아타운에서 살다 온 거 아니야?” [나는 관대하다. 나는 전성국이고 마흔 살이며, 품격 있는 전직 재벌이었으니까….] 나는 어금니를 앙 물고 참았다. 하지만 남학생은 계속해서 깐족거렸다. “쟤 아마 공부 못해서 연습생 핑계 대고 한국 온 걸 거야. 보나 마나 뻔하지. 여기 와서 이미지 세탁하고 아이돌로 데뷔하고, 영어 좀 하면 우리나라 사람들 엄청 좋아하잖아.” 나의 관대함의 한계는 세 번까지이다. 그리고 지금 막 저 녀석이 내 관대함의 한계를 건드리고 말았다. “그치? 너 사실은 미국에서 엄청 놀았지?” 나는 주먹을 꽉 쥐었다. “주먹 쥐면 어쩌게? 때리게?” “나이가 몇 살이신지 모르겠지만, 전성국이라고 초록창에 검색 한번 해보시면 저에 대해서 다 아실 거예요. 제가 말하기에는 스펙이 너무 대단해서요.” “뭐래? 또라이 아니야? 저 나이에 무슨 스펙이 있어?” 이유미가 휴게실에 놓인 컴퓨터로 내 이름을 검색하는 게 보였다. “대에박!” “왜 그래, 유미야?” “여기 기사에… 전성국. <다섯 남자와 아기 바구니>에 나왔던 그 어린 소년이 최연소로 하버드에 입학했대. 설마, 그 전성국이 너야?” [이제야 알아보는군. 조용히 있으려고 했는데… 어쩔 수 없지.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “야, 말도 안 돼. 하버드를 무슨 중학생이 가?” “아니야, 오빠 기사 봐. 진짜 그렇게 나와 있어. 효진 그룹의 <준호 재단> 첫 장학생 전성국 군, 하버드 입학하다.” 이때, 복도 끝에서 방무혁이 걸어왔다. “거기 다들 왜 그렇게 시끄러워?” “피디님! 성국이요, 정말 하버드생이에요?” 방무혁 피디가 아무렇지 않게 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 벌써 들킨 거야?” “어쩌다 보니 그렇게 됐어요.” 연습생 모두 입을 벌린 채 나를 쳐다봤다. [다들 하버드생은 처음이지?] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다.","completion":"Episode 115 Hansori explained in a gentle voice. \\"I just wanted to test whether you were becoming a trainee just for fun or not.\\" [Hansori teacher, my heart is all torn up because of your test.] I couldn't say anything back and just weakly nodded my head. \\"You're incredibly smart, aren't you? Just like you studied hard and went to Harvard, all the kids here are working really hard to debut. That's why I was a bit harsh on you.\\" [Please take back what you said about me being tone-deaf, Teacher Han.] \\"And actually, Seongguk, you don't have much talent in singing.\\" [Ah, killed me twice.] Hansori handed me a drink. \\"Drink this and cheer up, and vocal practice is twice a week. I'll give you homework each time, so you have to practice hard. I've made even the tone-deaf able to stand on stage. If you work hard, you won't have to hear that you can't sing anywhere.\\" \\"Yes, Teacher.\\" * * * Bang Muhyuk patted my shoulder. \\"Hansori is no joke, right?\\" \\"Yes… I was totally scared.\\" \\"If they're not scared, the kids don't practice well. Honestly, teenagers want to play more. Motivation is important, but to really stand on stage, you need to practice, and practice again.\\" \\"Yes.\\" I was fully experiencing what it was like to be a trainee idol in South Korea. \\"Shall we go meet the dance teacher now?\\" [I'm not confident in dancing...] I nodded my head absentmindedly. \\"The dance practice room is one floor down.\\" [My legs are already shaking.] I quickly pulled myself together. Born into a dirt-poor family and having made it to Harvard, I couldn't let myself be discouraged by something like this! * * * The dance instructor was the famously tough sister character, Lee Seorin. She later became a choreographer who frequently appeared on various audition programs on TV. \\"Today, I'll just do a simple test to see what your basic skills are like.\\" [I don't have any basic skills...] \\"First, let's warm up following me.\\" \\"Yes.\\" I warmed up following Lee Seorin. Warming up felt like it was also testing my basic skills. \\"Seongguk, now try following my movements. This is the basic wave movement. Start with your head. Then chest, stomach. Think of it as your hips. And then reverse, stomach, hips. Chest, tuck in your head!\\" \\"How about it, can you do it?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Confidence is great. Try following me slowly.\\" Lee Seorin connected the movements from head to stomach smoothly with a wave motion. [Head, chest, hips, stomach...] I tried to wave smoothly from my head, remembering the order. \\"Seongguk! Head, chest, hips. Stomach!\\" \\"I did that.\\" Lee Seorin burst into laughter. \\"You're moving like one big lump. The wave needs to move precisely, head, chest, stomach. Like this, each part of the body has to move.\\" [I'm not Lego, how can my body move separately like that, Teacher.] Chuckle. I heard Bang Muhyuk trying to hold back his laughter from behind. [Everyone's too much. Too much.] But Lee Seorin wasn't as scary as Hansori. \\"Seongguk, everyone's like this at first. Don't worry too much, if you just follow me well, you'll be able to do it. I see potential.\\" \\"Yes, Teacher.\\" I wiped off the sweat pouring down like crazy. * * * Vocals D Dance D- [What the, Teacher. You said I had potential and then gave me a lower score than Teacher Han! As expected, you can't trust people.] I received my report card with a dumbfounded face. Seeing a D for the first time in my life... I felt dizzy. \\"Producer Bang, how does my score compare to other trainees? Are there trainees who debuted with scores like this?\\" \\"Honestly, I'll tell you. Don't be shocked.\\" [Is there more shock left in this situation?] I felt like my dark circles reached the ground. \\"Honestly, I don't think I've seen scores like this among the trainees. But usually, one of the two is outstanding, so they get cast as trainees. Seongguk, you have great looks. But from what I've seen of many trainees, the most important thing is really effort. Tone-deafness can be fixed, and even those with no sense of rhythm can definitely become idols.\\" \\"Thank you for the consolation.\\" Bang Muhyuk patted my shoulder. \\"It's not consolation, it's true. You once said to us when we were debating whether to eliminate Yejin or not. A group needs outstanding members, but it also needs members who blend well with the others without standing out.\\" [I said such a gem of a phrase.] \\"Let's go say hi to the first-year trainees now. You'll continue to take individual singing lessons, but from now on, you'll be practicing dance with these friends. They're all gathered in the meeting room, so let's go.\\" \\"Yes, Producer. But, do they know about me?\\" \\"I just told them a friend from the US is coming to be a trainee during the vacation.\\" \\"I'd like you to introduce me just like that for now.\\" \\"Are you feeling pressured? If they search your name on Naver, related articles will come up. Recent photos might also appear.\\" \\"Let's talk about it when they find out. Until then, I want to live like a normal teenager. I want to make friends my age.\\" \\"Alright, got it.\\" * * * As the meeting room door opened, about nine boys and girls were sitting mixed together. The youngest looked about my age, and there were also trainees who looked like adults. Bang Muhyuk introduced me to the trainees. \\"This is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, who will be practicing with us from today. I mentioned him before, right? He's been attending school in the US, but he's here specially for the vacation. Seongguk, say hello.\\" \\"Hello. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Please take good care of me.\\" Applause sounded, and soon the kids started murmuring. \\"Wow, isn't he the best-looking among the male trainees?\\" [Hey, I can hear that.] But being ranked first in looks was somewhat comforting after the shock of receiving the lowest scores in vocals and dance. \\"Feel free to ask any questions.\\" At Bang Muhyuk's words, questions burst out from here and there. Then Bang Muhyuk quickly mediated. \\"Everyone's really curious. Let's just go clockwise and ask one question each. Jeongmi, you start.\\" \\"How old are you?\\" \\"I'm fourteen in Korean age.\\" \\"Wow, how tall are you?\\" \\"I'm not sure exactly... about 175cm.\\" \\"Where do you go to school in the US?\\" \\"Cambridge, Massachusetts.\\" \\"You look like you could be in a suit advertisement.\\" The boys chuckled. Next, a girl with particularly pale skin asked a question. \\"What's your specialty?\\" \\"My face.\\" At that moment, the meeting room burst into laughter. \\"Puhaha.\\" \\"His specialty is his face.\\" \\"Totally funny!\\" [Why are they reacting like this? I was just stating a fact... Weird.] * * * \\"Seongguk, let's start the real practice tomorrow. But it seems like the trainees don't know you well. They don't know Jeon Seongguk from <Five Men and a Baby Basket>...\\" \\"When that show was on, they were all probably crawling around. At most, toddling.\\" \\"That's true. I guess I'm the only one getting older. Are you hungry?\\" \\"A little.\\" \\"I have to meet a singer. I'll talk briefly and come back, so wait here for a bit.\\" \\"Yes.\\" I sat for a moment in the rest area set up between the practice rooms. The rest area had albums and bromides of singers who debuted through JP lined up, with 'Just' naturally being the center. Grrr. That's when I remembered the chocolate Min-guk had shoved into my pocket in the morning. I quickly took out a few pieces of chocolate and ate them. \\"Excuse me...\\" Someone quietly called me from behind. Who is it? Turning around, I saw the girl with the pale face from the meeting room and another girl who had been sitting next to her, both looking at me with sparkling eyes. \\"Hi, I'm Yumi.\\" \\"Hi, I'm Jin-ah.\\" The one with the pale face was Yumi. The one next to her was Jin-ah. [I think I saw them in some group later on...] I tilted my head. After being selected for the debut group, their faces kept upgrading, so it was honestly hard to recognize them now. Many used their real names when debuting, but many also used stage names. In my previous life, I had defected from girl groups after Fin.K.L and S.E.S, so I didn't remember much about groups other than the very famous ones. Occasionally, I met idol-turned-actors. \\"Uh, hello.\\" \\"Seongguk, we're both the same age as you. We're both going to be fourteen this year, entering middle school.\\" [So, what do you want? To drop honorifics? You're not even old enough to bleed from your head.] Instead of answering, I just kept my mouth shut. Certainly, since I dropped out in the first grade of elementary school, I hadn't had much chance to mingle with my peers, so I was a bit confused about the social behaviors of middle schoolers these days. \\"Uh, nice to meet you.\\" [Is this appropriate? Or not? Ah, right. Kids like snacks.] I offered them chocolate. \\"Do you want some chocolate? My younger brother gave it to me. He said to eat it when I'm hungry.\\" [This used to work with elementary school kids.] \\"We're on a diet, so no thanks. Sorry.\\" Jin-ah replied with a bit of sass. [Hm, failure.] It was definitely harder to deal with peers. In the US, I hung out with Mark, Dennis, Jesse, and other friends who were older than me, so I didn't really act my age and behaved more maturely. Yumi asked with curiosity-filled eyes. \\"Seongguk, then how long have you lived in the US?\\" \\"About 5 years.\\" I moved there when I was nine, so just over 5 years. \\"Wow, you must be really good at English then. The producer told us to study English, but it's so hard.\\" [Maybe you're just not smart.] Yumi whined a bit. [Whiny Yumi. Sassy Jin-ah. Both the same age.] I mentally tagged the two with their characters. \\"Do you guys also take English lessons here?\\" \\"Yeah. We take English lessons, acting lessons, everything. Seongguk, you're lucky you don't have to study English.\\" At that moment, other female and male trainees started to gather around. \\"Wow, specialty is his face? This guy?\\" \\"I'll recognize it in one go. Really handsome. And so tall!\\" [This darn popularity...] Even here, I was the center of everyone's attention. \\"You, if you're from the US, then in movies, kids our age date a lot, right? Do you have a girlfriend? Blonde with blue eyes?\\" \\"Movies are just movies.\\" [In this life, I'm a pure and untouched solo since birth.] A tall boy looked at me and laughed. His eyes were monolid and slightly slanted, the so-called JP look, but he seemed a bit rude. \\"Hey, movies are what? Movies are just movies. You're probably bullied there for being Asian, with no friends, right?\\" [I am generous. I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>...] I started to control my mind internally. \\"I have friends. But I haven't dated yet. I'm not interested.\\" \\"Chi, it's always these types who later cause trouble with women.\\" [I am generous. I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and I'm forty years old...] The girl stopped the tall boy. \\"Gunju, stop it. You always pick on the good-looking newbies.\\" \\"I really hate those who show off because they've been abroad. You, can you even speak English properly? Not just living in Koreatown and coming here?\\" [I am generous. I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, forty years old, and a dignified former chaebol...] I clenched my teeth and held back. But the boy kept provoking me. \\"You probably messed around in the US and came to Korea under the guise of being a trainee. It's obvious. Come here, wash your image, debut as an idol, and if you speak a bit of English, Koreans love it.\\" My generosity has a limit of three times. And now, this guy just crossed my limit of generosity. \\"Right? You must have really messed around in the US?\\" I clenched my fist. \\"What are you going to do by clenching your fist? Hit me?\\" \\"If you don't know how old I am, searching Jeon Seongguk on Naver will tell you everything about me. My specs are too great for me to explain.\\" \\"What? Are you crazy? What specs can you have at that age?\\" Yumi went to the computer in the lounge and searched my name. \\"Daebak!\\" \\"Why, Yumi?\\" \\"Here in the article... Jeon Seongguk. The young boy from <Five Men and a Baby Basket> entered Harvard as the youngest student. Don't tell me, that Jeon Seongguk is you?\\" [Now you recognize me. I wanted to keep it quiet... but it can't be helped.] I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Wow, no way. What middle schooler goes to Harvard?\\" \\"No, look at the article. It's really written like that. Hyojin Group's <Junho Foundation> first scholarship recipient Jeon Seongguk enters Harvard.\\" At that moment, Bang Muhyuk walked down the hallway. \\"Why is it so noisy here?\\" \\"Producer! Is Seongguk really a Harvard student?\\" Producer Bang Muhyuk looked at me nonchalantly. \\"Seongguk, you've been found out already?\\" \\"It just happened.\\" All the trainees looked at me with their mouths open. [First time seeing a Harvard student, huh?] I shrugged my shoulders."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[호르몬 때문인가?] 나이로 치면 이제 슬슬 사춘기 호르몬이 왕성하게 활동할 때이긴 했다. 달칵. 이때, 문이 열리는 소리가 들렸다. 예진이 반갑게 인사를 했다. “선희야. 어쩐 일이야?” 예진이랑 같이 <원더우먼>의 멤버가 되는 그 선희가 등장했다. 확실히 선희는 큰 키에 늘씬한 몸매. 완벽한 이목구비가 지금부터도 빛이 났다. [그래, 선희한테 확인해 보면 되겠어….] 확실히 저번 생이라면 만두상 예진이보다는 정석 미인에 가까운 선희가 내 스타일이었다. 거기다 도도한 매력까지. 내가 죽고 못 살던 스타일이었다. “예진아, 너 여기서 뭐 해?” “응. 성국이라고 연습생인데, 내가 좀 가르쳐주고 있었어.” “혹시 네가 얼굴 천재 맞지?” [내가 그런 별명으로 JP 사이에서 소문이 났군.] 나는 얼른 허리를 펴고 선희에게 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 얼굴 천재 전성국입니다.” 순간, 선희의 얼굴은 종잇장처럼 구겨졌다. “그걸 본인이 말하는 사람이 누가 있니? 너 미국서 살다 왔다더니, 한국 분위기 파악이 안 되는 모양이네.” 이 쌀쌀함까지. 나한테 이렇게 쌀쌀맞게 구는 여자는 처음인데…. 라며 저번 생에서는 참 좋아했던 스타일인데. 나도 모르는 사이에 입꼬리가 슬쩍 올라가고 있었다. 그런데 심장은 전혀 나대지 않았다. 나는 지그시 심장에 손을 얹었지만, 고요할 뿐이었다. “왜, 내 말이 기분 나빠?” “아니요. 먼저 그렇게 말씀하셔서요. 제가 잘못 이해했어요.” “근데 진짜 잘생긴 건 인정. 몇 살이야?” “열네 살이요.” “아하, 예진이랑 나보다 두 살 어리네.” “네.” 예진이가 끼어들었다. “저번 방학 때도 왜 우리 월말 평가하는 거 지켜봤잖아. 기억 안 나?” [나 한 번 보면 보통 못 잊는데… 선희, 모른 척하는 거지?] 선희는 고개를 갸웃했다. “연습생이 한둘이어야지.” [지금 설마. 나, 전성국을 기억하지 못한다고 말하고 있는 거야? 지금 나 도발하는 거지?] 선희는 대수롭지 않다는 듯 긴 머리를 풀어 헤쳤다. 선희에게는 예진과 달리 또 다른 달콤한 향기가 났다. 킁. 킁. 코가 먼저 반응했다. 드디어 사춘기 호르몬이 활동할 타이밍이 다가왔다. 그런데 이상하게 심장은 나대지 않았다. [부정맥은 아닌 모양이네, 다행이야….] 순간, 나는 번뜩 고개를 들고 만두상 예진을 쳐다봤다. [설마… 이번 생에서는 내 취향이 저 만두상이라고? 아니야, 나 정석 미인 좋아한다고….] 내가 당황하는 사이, 선희가 나와 예진을 번갈아 봤다. “연습 안 할 거야?” “해야지.” “선희야, 우리 끝나고 요 앞에 새로 생긴 분식집에 밥 먹으러 가자.” “오늘 저 가르쳐 주셨으니, 밥은 제가 살게요.” “좋아, 성국아.” 예진은 반겼지만, 선희는 별로 반기지 않았다. “난 가르쳐준 것도 없는데?” “지금부터 가르쳐 주시면 되죠. 그때 월말 평가 때 춤 굉장히 잘 추셨잖아요.” 나는 일부러 선희에게 더 자연스레 말을 걸었다. [내가 왜 마크가 하던 찐따 같은 행동을 하고 있는 거지….] “맞아, 선희가 우리 또래 연습생 중에서는 제일 춤 잘 춰.” “그럼, 우선 너 실력이 어느 정도인지 보자.” “네에!” 나는 손을 번쩍 들었다. * * * “성국아, 많이 먹어.” 예진이는 살뜰하게 나를 챙겼다. “성국아, 너무 실망하지 마.” 옆에서 서늘한 목소리로 선희는 나를 위로했다. 나는 디지털카메라로 찍은 전설의 <완벽한 남자>를 추는 내 모습을 보고 있었다. 여름날 지친 나방이 불빛을 향해 돌진하는 저돌적인 느낌을 자아내고 싶었지만, 동영상의 나는 거미줄에 걸려서 바동거리는 귀뚜라미일 뿐이었다. 고개가 절로 떨어졌다. “성국아, 너처럼 완벽한 애가 춤 못 추는 건 좀 인간적이던데?” [선희, 지금 나 놀리는 거야?] “그래, 성국아. 너 연습한 지 며칠 되지도 않았잖아. 우리는 그때 너보다 더 못 췄어. 어서 밥 먹자.” 예진이의 위로에 숟가락을 겨우 들었다. “근데 성국아, 너 미국에 여자 친구 정말 없어?” 예진이의 물음에 선희도 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. “미국에선 동기들이 나보다 다 나이가 많기도 하고, 연애에 관심도 없었어요.” 이건 사실이었다. “누나들은 연애 안 하세요?” 나는 은근히 질문을 던졌다. [그래, 이건 자연스러웠어. 전성국!] “우리 JP 연습생들끼리 연애 금지야.” 그 순간, 내 머릿속이 하얘졌다. 연애 금지라니? 그럼, 예진이랑 안 된다는 거잖아! [잠깐, 내가 왜 겨우 연애 금지에 놀라는 거지? 연애는 원래 관심도 없는데….] 이놈의 사춘기 호르몬은 정말 주체할 수가 없었다. “성국아, 왜 그렇게 놀라?” “아, 그냥요. 연애 금지라는 게 좀 놀라워서요. 제가 미국에서 살다 왔잖아요.” 나는 대충 얼버무렸다. “아, 그렇지. 근데 몰래 다들 해.” 예진이가 친절하게도 알려줬다. “진짜요?” “응.” “누나도 남자 친구 있어요?” “난 없어.” [휴우- 다행이야….] 예진이의 대답에 또 심장이 슬쩍 나댈 기미를 보였다. 혹시라도 이상하게 보일까 봐 나는 얼른 선희에게도 똑같은 질문을 했다. “그럼, 누나는요?” “나? 나도 없어. 우리는 연습하기에도 바빠.” 나는 다시 조금 기운을 차렸다. “누나들 많이 드세요. 제가 살게요.” “참, 성국아. 번호 좀. 내일 또 연습하러 올 거지?” [당연하지!] “같이 연습하면 금방 늘 거야.” 나는 얼른 예진의 폰에 전화번호를 남겼다. “나도 줘.” “네!” 선희의 폰에도 전화번호를 남겼다. 어쨌든 내일 또 예진을 본다는 생각에 마음이 들뜨기 시작했다. * * * 나는 후드 티를 몇 번이나 입고 벗었다. 하지만 도대체 마음에 드는 핏이 나오지 않았다. 똑. 똑. “성국아. 아침 먹어.” 밖에서 엄마의 목소리가 들렸다. “응.” 나는 하는 수 없이 조금 핏이 어정쩡한 후드 티를 입고 나갔다. “성국아, 오늘도 연습 갈 거야?” “응.” “친구들은 많이 사귀었어?” “조금. 엄마, 나 이 후드 티 잘 안 어울리지?” “후드 티 편하다고 그것만 샀잖아.” “다른 옷은 없나….” 있을 리가 없었다. 패셔니스타 재벌 시절의 추억은 다 버리고 일에만 매진하다 보니 후드 티밖에 안 산 지 꽤 오래됐다. 후드 티 위에 더플코트 혹은 패딩을 입는 게 내 겨울 패션의 전부였다. “성국아, 옷 사러 갈까? 안 그래도 너 옷 좀 사야 할 것 같았어. 오늘 연습 끝나고 같이 백화점 갈까?” [끝나고 예진이랑 밥 먹어야 하는데….] 나는 깊은 고민에 빠졌다. “엄마, 주말에 같이 가요.” “그래. 성국아, JP 여자 연습생들 이쁘지? 친구 하자는 애 없어?” “엄마, 우리 연애 금지야.” “엄마가 언제 연애라고 했어? 친구 없나 했지.” 뜨끔. 도둑이 또 제 발 저리고 말았다. “엄마, 나 빨리 가봐야 해.” “응. 어서 먹어.” 엄마는 묘한 미소를 지으며 나를 바라봤다. [엄마, 그런 얼굴로 보지 마. 나, 여자 친구 생겨도 절대 공개 안 할 거야. 나 원래 비공개 연애가 취향이거든.] * * * “헉. 헉. 헉.” 나는 거침 숨을 토해냈다. 연습실에서 1시간 넘게 혼자 춤 연습을 했는데, 예진은 나타나지 않았다. [분명 어제 같이 연습하자고 그랬잖아! 그냥 물어본 건가… 내가 착각한 건가….] 또 마음이 오락가락했다. 이때, 연습실 문이 열리면서 선희와 예진이 동시에 들어왔다. [예진 누나! 왜 이렇게 늦었어?] 어김없이 심장이 먼저 나대기 시작했다. 내가 반갑게 다가가자, 예진이 미안한 얼굴로 먼저 말을 걸었다. “성국아, 오늘 연습 같이 못 할 것 같아. 그리고 앞으로도 같이 연습 못 할 거 같아.” “무슨 말이세요?” “나랑 예진이가 데뷔조로 뽑혔거든.” 둘이 데뷔조로 뽑혀서 <원더우먼>으로 데뷔한다는 것쯤은 나도 잘 알고 있다. “그게… 이제부터 나랑 선희는 데뷔조라서 숙소 생활 할 거야. 아침에 매니저가 회사에 데려다주면 연습하고, 또 연습하고… 아마 개인적으로 너한테 춤 연습 도와줄 수 없을 것 같아.” “그럼… 누나들 이제 못 보는 거예요?” [예진 누나! 안 돼!] 예진은 정말 미안한 얼굴이었다. “완전히 못 보는 건 아니고. 근데 데뷔조로 준비 시작하면 정말 아침부터 저녁까지 개인 시간이 안 나. 성국아, 미안해.” “성국아, 너도 열심히 해서 데뷔해. 알았지?” 나는 이를 앙 물었다. “누나들 꼭 데뷔하세요. 응원할게요!” 예진과 선희는 고맙다는 말을 남기고 연습실을 나섰다. 나는 그대로 자리에 주저앉았다. 주책없이 나대던 심장도 고요해졌다. [하아, 이 몸의 첫 실연인가….] 문이 달칵 열리는 소리가 들렸다. 나는 반사적으로 문을 바라봤다. 혹시나 예진이가 다시 들어오나 기대를 했지만, 징징 이유미였다. “성국아, 한소리 선생님이 너 보컬 레슨 올라오래.” “어….” * * * “성국이 이번 월말 평가에서 <거짓이야> 부를 거지? 연습 좀 했어?” “네… 했는데, 잘은 모르겠어요.” “우선 오늘은 편하게 불러보자.” “네에.” 한소리가 건반을 치기 시작했다. 그리고 나는 저스트의 <거짓이야>를 부르기 시작했다. “내게 했던 모든 눈빛 모두가 거짓이야. 내게 했던 모든 행동 모두가 거짓이야. 내게 했던 모든 약속 모두가 거짓이야! 거짓이야!” 나는 처음으로 <거짓이야>를 끝까지 다 불렀다. 한소리가 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 감정이 이렇게 좋았어?” “네에?” “꼭 실연당한 사람처럼 노래 부르잖아. 성국아, 내가 널 잘못 평가한 것 같아. 음은 좀 많이 불안하긴 한데, 감정이 너무 좋아. 감정 좋은 보컬은 정말 찾기 힘들거든.” 한소리의 칭찬을 듣는데, 하나도 안 기쁜 건 왜일까. * * * 그날 밤, 나는 집에 와서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 오늘 보컬 연습한 영상을 올렸다. - 2004년 1월 2일. ‘저스트’의 <거짓이야> 커버했습니다. 한번 들어보세요. 곧 댓글들이 수두룩 달리기 시작했다. - 보컬 완전 좋아졌어! - 이 노래 장난 아니게 훅 한다. 거짓이야. 거짓이야. K-POP 중독성 장난 아니야. - 감정 죽이는데? 너 꼭 실연당한 사람 같아. 나는 조용히 다시 <거짓이야>의 가사를 음미했다. 날 보며 웃던 그 눈빛도. 춤 가르쳐 주겠다던 그 약속도. “모두 거짓이었어. 흑-.” 나는 뜨거운 눈물을 훔쳤다. 이렇게 또 어른이 되는 거겠지….","completion":"Episode 117 Yejin looked at me and came one step closer with a grin. Thump thump. Why does my heart race as Yejin, the dumpling-faced girl, approaches? \\"Sungguk, why are you staring like that?\\" \\"It's nothing. Please just teach me the dance.\\" \\"Okay. Shall we start?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I pressed down on my racing heart with my hand. When I saw Yejin half a year ago, I felt nothing... but today was a bit strange. I started to get confused whether my heart was racing because of Yejin or because of arrhythmia. Yejin started by stretching her arms and legs. \\"Sungguk, it's really important to stretch before dancing. You're not going to be an idol for just a year or two. Plus, if you get injured, it affects the other members, so don't forget to stretch.\\" \\"Yes, noona.\\" I followed Yejin and started to loosen up my body. Yejin then connected an MP3 to the speaker. \\"Sungguk, what song did you choose for the end-of-month evaluation?\\" \\"I chose 'It's a Lie' by Just and 'The Perfect Man' by Legend for the dance.\\" \\"Oh, that's unexpected.\\" \\"What is?\\" \\"I thought you'd prepare a pop song since you went to school in the US.\\" American singers, even if they were boy groups, had dance moves that were more like aerobics, and the groove and soul of black artists were beyond my ability to imitate. \\"Then, shall we practice 'The Perfect Man' by Legend together?\\" \\"Yes!\\" * * * \\"Sungguk, raise your hand a bit more to your chin. Yes, like that!\\" \\"Sungguk, when your head turns, your gaze should follow.\\" \\"Now, step out with your right foot and turn!\\" For an hour, Yejin tirelessly watched my choreography. \\"Huff. Huff. Huff-.\\" I bent over, gasping for breath. \\"Sungguk, you're not bad at dancing?\\" \\"Huff- Really?\\" \\"Are you tired? Should we stop practicing?\\" Yejin looked back at me with a sweaty face. Thump. Thump. Thump thump. I was fine while practicing, but my heart started racing crazily again. [Is it because of hormones?] Considering my age, it was about time for puberty hormones to be actively at work. Click. At that moment, I heard the door open. Yejin greeted cheerfully. \\"Sunhee, what brings you here?\\" Sunhee, who was to become a member of \\"Wonder Woman\\" with Yejin, appeared. Sunhee definitely had a tall and slender figure. Her perfect facial features were already shining. [Right, I can check with Sunhee...] If it were my past life, Sunhee, who was closer to the standard of beauty than dumpling-faced Yejin, would have been my type. Plus, she had a haughty charm. She was the style I used to die for. \\"Yejin, what are you doing here?\\" \\"Ah. This is Sungguk, a trainee. I was teaching him a bit.\\" \\"Are you the face genius?\\" [I guess I'm known as the face genius among JP.] I quickly straightened up and greeted Sunhee. \\"Hello. I'm the face genius, Jeon Sungguk.\\" Suddenly, Sunhee's face crumpled like a piece of paper. \\"Who says that about themselves? You lived in the US, but it seems you don't get the atmosphere in Korea.\\" Even this coldness. This was the first time a girl acted so coldly towards me... I used to like this style in my past life. Without realizing it, the corners of my mouth were slightly raised. But my heart didn't race at all. I pressed my hand against my heart, but it was calm. \\"Why, did my words upset you?\\" \\"No. It's just that you said it first. I misunderstood.\\" \\"But you are really handsome. How old are you?\\" \\"Fourteen.\\" \\"Ah, you're two years younger than Yejin and me.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Yejin joined in. \\"You watched our end-of-month evaluation during the last vacation, remember? Don't you remember?\\" [I usually can't forget someone after seeing them once... Sunhee, are you pretending not to know?] Sunhee tilted her head. \\"There are so many trainees.\\" [Are you saying you don't remember me, Jeon Sungguk, right now? Are you provoking me?] Sunhee casually let down her long hair. Sunhee had a different sweet scent from Yejin. Sniff. Sniff. My nose reacted first. Finally, the timing for puberty hormones to act had come. But strangely, my heart didn't race. [It seems it's not arrhythmia, thankfully...] Suddenly, I looked up sharply and stared at dumpling-faced Yejin. [Could it be... in this life, my taste is this dumpling-faced girl? No, I like standard beauties...] While I was confused, Sunhee looked back and forth between Yejin and me. \\"Aren't you going to practice?\\" \\"We should.\\" \\"Sunhee, let's go eat at the new snack bar in front of us after we finish.\\" \\"I'll pay for the meal since you taught me today.\\" \\"Great, Sungguk.\\" Yejin was pleased, but Sunhee didn't seem very enthusiastic. \\"I didn't teach anything, though?\\" \\"You can start teaching now. You danced really well during the end-of-month evaluation.\\" I deliberately spoke more naturally to Sunhee. [Why am I acting like Mark, who was a total nerd...] \\"Right, Sunhee is the best dancer among our age group of trainees.\\" \\"Then, let's see how good you are first.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I raised my hand high. * * * \\"Sungguk, eat a lot.\\" Yejin took good care of me. \\"Sungguk, don't be too disappointed.\\" Next to me, Sunhee comforted me with a cool voice. I was watching a video of me dancing to \\"The Perfect Man\\" by Legend, filmed with a digital camera. I wanted to exude the reckless feeling of a tired moth rushing towards the light, but in the video, I was just a cricket struggling in a spider web. My head naturally dropped. \\"Sungguk, it's kind of human for someone as perfect as you to not be able to dance?\\" [Sunhee, are you teasing me?] \\"Right, Sungguk. You've only been practicing for a few days. We were worse than you back then. Let's eat.\\" Yejin's consolation made me barely pick up my spoon. \\"But Sungguk, you really don't have a girlfriend in the US?\\" Yejin's question made Sunhee also stare at me intently. \\"I was younger than my peers in the US, and I wasn't interested in dating.\\" That was the truth. \\"Do noona's date?\\" I asked casually. [Good, Jeon Sungguk!] \\"We JP trainees are banned from dating.\\" At that moment, my mind went blank. Dating is banned? Then, I can't be with Yejin! [Wait, why am I surprised by just a dating ban? I wasn't even interested in dating...] \\"Sungguk, why are you so surprised?\\" \\"Ah, just. I was surprised by the dating ban. I lived in the US, you know.\\" I mumbled an excuse. \\"Ah, right. But everyone secretly dates.\\" Yejin kindly informed me. \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Do you have a boyfriend, noona?\\" \\"I don't.\\" [Phew- That's a relief...] Yejin's answer made my heart slightly flutter again. Just in case it looked strange, I quickly asked Sunhee the same question. \\"What about you, noona?\\" \\"Me? I don't have one either. We're too busy practicing.\\" I felt a bit more energized. \\"Noonas, eat a lot. It's on me.\\" \\"By the way, Sungguk. Give me your number. You're coming to practice tomorrow, right?\\" [Of course!] \\"Practicing together will make you improve quickly.\\" I quickly left my phone number on Yejin's phone. \\"Me too.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I also left my number on Sunhee's phone. Just the thought of seeing Yejin again tomorrow made my heart flutter. * * * I put on and took off my hoodie several times. But I couldn't find a fit that satisfied me. Knock. Knock. \\"Sungguk. Come eat breakfast.\\" My mom's voice came from outside. \\"Yes.\\" Having no choice, I went out wearing a hoodie that fit a bit awkwardly. \\"Sungguk, are you going to practice today too?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Did you make a lot of friends?\\" \\"A few. Mom, does this hoodie not suit me well?\\" \\"You said hoodies are comfortable, so you only bought those.\\" \\"Don't I have other clothes?\\" It was impossible. During my days as a fashionista chaebol, I threw away all memories of that and focused solely on work, so it had been quite a while since I only bought hoodies. Wearing a hoodie with a duffle coat or padding on top was all of my winter fashion. \\"Sungguk, should we go buy clothes? I was thinking you need to buy some clothes. Shall we go to the department store after practice today?\\" [I have to eat with Yejin after practice...] I fell into deep thought. \\"Mom, let's go together on the weekend.\\" \\"Okay. Sungguk, do the JP female trainees look pretty? No one asked to be friends?\\" \\"Mom, we're banned from dating.\\" \\"When did mom mention dating? I was asking if you had friends.\\" I felt caught. \\"Mom, I need to go quickly.\\" \\"Okay. Eat up.\\" Mom looked at me with a strange smile. [Mom, don't look at me like that. Even if I get a girlfriend, I'll never make it public. I prefer private relationships.] * * * \\"Huff. Huff. Huff.\\" I exhaled roughly. I had been practicing dance alone in the practice room for over an hour, but Yejin hadn't shown up. [Didn't she say we'd practice together yesterday? Was it just a question... Did I misunderstand...] My mind was in turmoil again. Then, the practice room door opened, and Sunhee and Yejin entered together. [Yejin noona! Why are you so late?] My heart started racing first as always. As I approached them happily, Yejin spoke first with an apologetic face. \\"Sungguk, I don't think I can practice with you today. And I might not be able to practice with you in the future either.\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"I and Yejin have been selected for the debut team.\\" I was well aware that the two were selected for the debut team and would debut as \\"Wonder Woman.\\" \\"That means... from now on, Sunhee and I, as the debut team, will live in the dorms. We'll be taken to the company by the manager in the morning, practice, and practice again... I probably won't be able to help you with dance practice personally.\\" \\"Does that mean... I won't see noona anymore?\\" [Yejin noona! No!] Yejin looked genuinely sorry. \\"It's not that we won't see each other at all. But once we start preparing for the debut, we really won't have any personal time from morning till evening. Sungguk, I'm sorry.\\" \\"Sungguk, work hard so you can debut too. Okay?\\" I clenched my teeth. \\"Noonas, make sure to debut. I'll support you!\\" Yejin and Sunhee left the practice room after leaving those words. I just sat down on the spot. My heart, which had been foolishly racing, calmed down. [Ha, is this my first heartbreak...] The door clicked open. I reflexively looked at the door, hoping Yejin might come back, but it was Jinjin Yumi. \\"Sungguk, Hansori teacher said you should come up for vocal lessons.\\" \\"Oh...\\" * * * \\"Sungguk, you're going to sing 'It's a Lie' for this month's evaluation, right? Did you practice?\\" \\"Yes... I did, but I'm not sure if it's good.\\" \\"Let's sing comfortably today.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Hansori started playing the keyboard. And I began to sing \\"It's a Lie\\" by Just. \\"Every look you gave me was a lie. Every action you took was a lie. Every promise you made was a lie! It's a lie!\\" For the first time, I sang \\"It's a Lie\\" to the end. Hansori looked at me with surprised eyes. \\"Sungguk, were your emotions always this good?\\" \\"Yes?\\" \\"You sing like someone who's been heartbroken. Sungguk, I think I underestimated you. Your pitch is quite unstable, but your emotions are really good. It's hard to find a vocalist with good emotions.\\" Hearing Hansori's praise, I wondered why I didn't feel happy at all. * * * That night, I uploaded a video of today's vocal practice on 'Face Paper.' - January 2, 2004. Covered 'It's a Lie' by Just. Please have a listen. Soon, comments started flooding in. - Your vocals have really improved! - This song is seriously addictive. It's a lie. It's a lie. The addictiveness of K-POP is no joke. - The emotion is killer? You really seem like someone who's been heartbroken. I quietly savored the lyrics of \\"It's a Lie\\" again. The look you gave me while smiling. The promise to teach me to dance. \\"All of it was a lie. Sob-.\\" I wiped away hot tears. This is how one grows up, I guess..."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

[이것들아. 내가 몇 살인 줄 알아?] 방무혁이 내 앞에 콜라를 내려놨다. “자, 미성년자들은 콜라 마셔야지.” [하아, 콜라나 마셔야 하는 미성년자라니. 태어나서 처음으로 D도 받았는데, 오늘 밤에 콜라 좀 들이부어 볼까!] 나는 콜라를 벌컥 마셨다. 서진아가 새침하게 방무혁에게 물었다. “피디님, 성국이 언제부터 아신 거예요?” “어, 몇 년 전에 뉴욕 갔다가 범선이가 소개해줬어. 다들 범선이는 알지?” “네! <저스트> 멤버잖아요.” “응. 범선이랑 뉴욕 갔는데, 우연히 식당에서 성국이를 만난 거야. 그러다가 성국이랑 단둘이 갤러리도 가고 시간을 많이 보냈어.” “대박.” 새침 서진아도 입이 떡 벌어졌다. “진짜 대박이지? 참, 너희들이 성국이 진짜 많이 도와줘야 해. 성국이가 한국에서는 학교생활을 한 적이 없어서 교우 관계 같은 거 많이 서툴 거야.” 이유미가 떡볶이를 입에 넣으며 물었다. “성국아, 하버드 들어가려면 얼마나 공부해야 해?” [엉덩이에 땀띠 나게.] 이런 말 하면 촌스럽다고 하겠지? “보딩스쿨, 그러니까 미국 고등학교 내내 상위권이었어. SAT라고 우리나라로 치면 수능 같은 건데. 그것도 최상위 점수 받아야 하고… 미국 대학들은 성적뿐 아니라 대외 활동도 많이 보거든. 난 ‘페이스 페이퍼’라는 것을 개발한 게 입시에 도움이 많이 됐어.” “‘페이스 페이퍼’가 뭐야?” “우리나라에 있는 도토리월드 같은 SNS야.” “와, 진짜 너 대단하구나.” [뭐, 이 정도야.] 나는 간만에 떡볶이를 후루룩 먹었다. 저번 생에서는 이런 건 불량 식품이라고 먹지도 못하게 했는데…. [왜 이렇게 맛있는 걸 못 먹게 한 거야?] 정말 눈이 번쩍 뜨이는 맛이었다. “참, 성국아. 부탁한 영상 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올릴 거야?” 방무혁에게 오늘 연습한 내용을 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올리게 파일로 달라고 부탁해놓은 상태였다. “네. 저번에 30달러로 한 달 살기 했듯이 이번에는 대한민국에서 아이돌 연습생으로 한 달 동안 살아보기 내용을 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올리려고요.” 이유미와 서진아는 나와 방무혁의 대화를 다 이해하진 못하는 것 같았다. [원래 열네 살에 이 대화를 이해하는 게 정상은 아니야. 난 매우 특별한 경우야.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “그냥 연습생 생활만 올리는 것도 재미있는데, 저번처럼 목표가 확실하면 더 좋지 않을까?” 역시 방무혁은 예리한 데가 있었다. “연습생 한 달 해서 데뷔조 들기. 어때요?” “불가능한 미션이지만, 사람들 이목을 확 끌겠는데?” “그렇죠?” 얼른 가서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 이 내용을 올릴 생각으로 벌써부터 흥이 나기 시작했다. 방무혁이 우리에게 떡볶이를 더 나눠줬다. “다이어트는 내일부터 하고, 많이들 먹어.” “네, 피디님.” 이유미와 서진아는 떡볶이를 후루룩 먹었다. 대한민국의 아이돌 준비생들에게 다이어트는 미적분보다 어려운 숙제였다. “참, 성국아. 내일부터 트레이닝 하는 거 따라갈 수 있겠어?” [설마, 지금 나 못 따라갈까 봐 걱정하는 거야, 방무혁?] 방무혁은 쐐기를 박았다. “하버드 우등생이라고 해서 JP 우등생일 수는 없잖아.” 화르르. 내 안에 잠자고 있는 승부욕이 불타오르기 시작했다. “해볼게요. 아니, 할 수 있어요!” * * * “형아, 그렇게 하면 어떡해. 자, 노래에 따라서 몸이 움직여야지. 나 따라 해 봐.” [하, 내가 민국이한테 춤을 배울 줄이야. 민국아, 내가 너 아역 배우 뽑히게 연습시킨 거 알아? 몰라?] 민국이는 화난 얼굴로 성질을 냈다. “형! 왜 이 쉬운 걸 못 따라 해!” [이거 그때 내가 혼낸 거 기억하는 거 같은데?] 나는 댄스를 멈췄다. “전민국. 난 네 형이야. 너, 지금 나한테 화낸 거야?” [너, 이 집안에서 지금 편하게 먹고 자는 게 다 누구 덕분인 줄 알아?] 이 말의 다른 버전쯤 됐다. 민국이는 조금 미안한 표정으로 나를 봤다. “형, 그게 아니라… 형이 너무 못하잖아.” 좌절. 이 단어가 머리 위에 딱 박히는 느낌이었다. [내가. 천하의 전성국이. 못하는 게 있다니….] 민국이가 내 눈치를 살피더니 목소리를 한결 부드럽게 냈다. “형, 나를 좀 따라 해 봐.” 나는 민국이를 따라서 어제 이서린 선생님의 말을 떠올리며 머리, 가슴, 골반, 배로 웨이브를 탔지만 좌절. “하아-.” 한숨을 길게 뱉었다. 민국이가 옆으로 오더니 내 옆에 쪼그리고 앉았다. “형, 나는 형이 이 세상에서 못하는 게 없는 사람인 줄 알았거든. 근데 형은 정말 몸치야. 이렇게 해서 어떻게 JP 연습생이 되겠다는 거야?” 민국이에게도 무시받는 실력이라니. 나는 이를 꽉 깨물었다. 민국이가 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “형, 안 되겠어. 아이돌은 포기하자.” “성국아, 나 아이돌 되려고 연습하는 거 아니야. 난 단지… ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 프로젝트 하는 거야. 한 달 동안 뭔가를 사람들에게 계속 보여주는 거야. 한 달이 짧다 하면 짧을 수 있지만, 인생을 바꿀 수도 있는 시간이거든.” 민국이가 내가 하는 말을 다 알아들을 리 만무했다. “뭔 소리인지 모르겠고.” [민국이 이 녀석, 컸다고 벌써 반항하네.] “형, 이 실력으로는 한 달이 아니라 일주일 만에 JP에서 쫓겨날 수도 있어. 다시 연습 시작하자.” “어, 알았어.” 나는 다시 일어나서 민국이에게 지적질을 당하며 춤을 배우기 시작했다. * * * - 대한민국 JP 연습생 1일 차. 가창 D. 댄스 D-. 이 실력으로 데뷔조에 들 수 있을까? 30일 프로젝트 시작! 내가 이 글을 나의 동영상과 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올리자 댓글들이 미친 듯이 달리기 시작했다. - 성국아, 꿈은 아무나 꾸는 거야. 이루는 사람은 적은 법이고. - JP에서 청소하는 거 아니지? 꼭 청소하는 모습 같은데…. - 저 춤 실력이면 할로윈 파티 때 마크한테 뭐라고 할 게 아닌데! - 성국, 우리는 너를 있는 모습 그대로 사랑해. - 성국이 최초의 실패를 보겠는데? 마지막은 유럽에 있는 마크의 댓글이었다. 마크는 유럽 각지를 여행 중이었다. 나는 동영상을 돌리고 또 돌렸다. 진짜 전성국 인생 최초의 실패가 눈앞에 있는 것 같았다. 달칵. 민국이가 문을 벌컥 열고 들어왔다. “전민국, 노크하고 들어와야지.” “형, 이상한 거 보고 있었어?” “뭐라고? 아니야.” 후다다닥. 민국이는 내 대답도 안 듣고, 부엌으로 뛰어가고 있었다. 밖에서 민국이가 소리치는 게 들렸다. “엄마! 형아 이상한 영상 봐!” “뭐?” 동시에 엄마가 달려오는 소리도 들렸다. “성국아, 민국이가 무슨 소리 하는 거야?” “엄마, 난 이상한 거 안 봤어. 오늘 연습한 거 찍은 동영상 봤어.” 순간, 엄마와 민국이의 눈이 반짝였다. 마치 먹잇감을 발견했다는 듯이. “성국아, 엄마도 너 연습한 거 너무 궁금해. 엄마 보여줘.” “어, 엄마. 이것 봐. 형, 춤 더럽게 못 춰. 맙소사!” 민국이는 어느새 노트북으로 달려와서 엄마에게 동영상을 보여줬다. [전민국, 너 두고 보자.] 엄마는 내 동영상을 보더니 미소를 지었다. “어머, 우리 성국이가 못하는 것도 다 있네.” 좌절. 엄마 눈에도 내가 엉망으로 보이는 모양이었다. “성국아, 한 달 동안 그냥 친구들도 사귀고 새로운 경험 한다고 생각해.” 엄마는 내 등을 도닥였다. 그 옆에서 민국이가 혀를 쭉 내밀며 메롱을 했다. “지금 밥하니까 조금 있다 나와.” “어, 엄마.” 민국이도 엄마를 따라 나가려는 순간, 나는 민국이의 목덜미를 잡아챘다. “형, 왜 그래?” “전민국, 형이랑 산수 공부 좀 해볼까?” “어…?” 민국이의 얼굴이 굳는 게 보였다. “형이 머리가 나빠도 공부 열심히 하면 중간은 간다고 했지?” “혀엉. 엄마, 아빠가 그러는데, 나 머리는 좋대. 노력을 안 해서 그렇지.” “그럼, 그 좋은 머리로 형과 함께 노력도 해볼까?” “형, 나 배가 고파서.” “밥 먹기 전에 30분. 밥 먹고 30분. 어서 산수 책 가지고 와. 안 그러면, JP 구경 없던 걸로 할 거야.” “어, 안 돼. 그건 절대 안 돼. 알았어, 형. 방에서 책 가지고 올게.” 민국이는 후다닥 방으로 뛰어갔다. 나는 입꼬리를 슬쩍 올렸다. [복수는 이렇게 하는 거지.] * * * - 2004년 1월 1일. 노력은 과연 배신하지 않을까? 오늘도 JP 연습실 출근. 나는 안무 연습실 거울 앞에 서서 일명 거울샷을 찍어서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올렸다. 존잘이라든지, 너무 잘생겼다는 말은 이제 지겨울 정도로 달렸다. 나는 텅 빈 연습실에서 음악을 틀었다. 그리고 완전히 음악에 온몸을 맡겼다. 둠치둠치. 둠치둠치. 두둠치. [그래, 이거야!] 텅 빈 연습실. 꽉 채운 사운드. 그동안 나를 옭아맸던 전직 재벌이라는 체면의 굴레를 벗어던지고…. 달칵. 누가 들어오는 소리에 나는 온몸이 굳고 말았다. [누가 감히 내 연습을 방해하는 거야?] “어? 성국이 아니야?” 뒤돌아본 곳에는 예진이가 있었다. “어, 누나?” “성국이 맞지? 방학 때 연습생으로 온다더니 진짜 왔네.” “네. 누나는 어쩐 일이세요? 오늘 1월 1일이잖아요.” “나도 연습하러 나왔어. 집에서 할 일도 별로 없고 해서. 새로 온 연습생 중에 엄청 잘생긴 애 있다고 해서 너 같다는 생각은 했어.” 예진이는 저번에 봤을 때보다 한결 성숙해 있었다. 까만 긴 머리를 한 갈래로 묶은 얼굴은 여전히 터질 듯 귀여웠다. “누나는 다행히 안 잘렸네요?” “응. 다행히 안 잘렸어. 나도 그동안 연습 많이 했거든. 근데 방금 너, 뭐 한 거야?” 순간 동공이 흔들렸다. [뭐 한 거냐니. 나 춤춘 건데….] “설마, 춤춘 거야?” “…….” 인정을 해도 문제, 안 해도 문제인 질문이었다. “풉, 성국아. 너 정말 몸치구나. 내가 가르쳐줄까? 나도 몸치라서 탈출하는 데 오래 걸렸거든.” “누나도 연습해야 하는 거 아니에요?” “원래 누구 도와주면서 하면 나도 늘잖아.” 예진이 웃으면서 다가왔다. 그러고는 한 갈래로 묶은 머리를 풀어서 흔들었다. 갑자기 공기 중에 향긋한 냄새가 퍼졌다. [이건 무슨 향수지?] 모든 게 아늑해지더니, 세상의 공기가 바뀌는 느낌이었다. 나는 예진을 다시 쳐다봤다. 이상하게 심장이 슬금슬금 빨라졌다. 두근. 두근. 두두근. [설마 이거… 부정맥인가?!]","completion":"Episode 116 In front of me was the prickly Seo Jin-ah. The haughty Lee Yoo-mi was sitting there. In front of us, tteokbokki was bubbling away. It was a spot arranged by Bang Mu-hyuk. \\"Seong-guk, you've lived abroad for a long time... and you don't have friends your age. Since Yoo-mi and Jin-ah are the same age, I thought it would be nice if you got along well. They could introduce you to the culture of peers in Korea....\\" [The culture of peers in Korea? What? Being ostracized?] My eyes narrowed. A tall male student had tested my patience several times just before. For a debut, it was normal for trainees to compete with each other countless times. Therefore, to a new trainee like me, who had a perfect face and good specs, they were somewhat hostile. Lee Yoo-mi started eating tteokbokki with a big smile. \\"Seong-guk, did you really go to Harvard?\\" \\"Yeah. You've seen my articles.\\" \\"I saw them, but... it's my first time seeing a genius like this.\\" \\"Plus, you're tall... you totally look like an adult.\\" Seo Jin-ah agreed. [You guys. Do you know how old I am?] Bang Mu-hyuk placed a cola in front of me. \\"Here, minors should drink cola.\\" [Sigh, to think I have to drink cola as a minor. For the first time in my life, I got a D, but maybe I'll chug some cola tonight!] I gulped down the cola. Seo Jin-ah asked Bang Mu-hyuk with a sly look. \\"PD-nim, how long have you known Seong-guk?\\" \\"Oh, a few years ago, I went to New York and Beom-seon introduced him to me. You all know Beom-seon, right?\\" \\"Yes! He's a member of <Just>.\\" \\"Yeah. I went to New York with Beom-seon, and by chance, we met Seong-guk at a restaurant. Then, Seong-guk and I went to a gallery alone and spent a lot of time together.\\" \\"Wow.\\" Seo Jin-ah's mouth fell open in surprise. \\"Really wow, right? By the way, you guys need to help Seong-guk a lot. Since Seong-guk has never experienced school life in Korea, he might be quite clumsy with social relationships.\\" Lee Yoo-mi asked while putting tteokbokki in her mouth. \\"Seong-guk, how much do you have to study to get into Harvard?\\" [Until you get a heat rash on your butt.] I guess saying this would sound old-fashioned? \\"I was in the top ranks throughout boarding school, that is, during high school in the US. For the SAT, which is similar to the Korean SAT, you need to score in the top percentile... For American colleges, they look at extracurricular activities as well as grades. Developing 'Face Paper' helped a lot with my admission.\\" \\"'Face Paper'? What's that?\\" \\"It's an SNS like Dotori World in our country.\\" \\"Wow, you're really amazing.\\" [Well, that's about it.] For the first time in a while, I slurped down the tteokbokki. In my previous life, I wasn't allowed to eat such \\"junk food\\".... [Why was I not allowed to eat something this delicious?] It was truly an eye-opening taste. \\"By the way, Seong-guk. Are you going to upload the video you asked for on 'Face Paper'?\\" I had asked Bang Mu-hyuk to send me the file of today's practice to upload on 'Face Paper'. \\"Yes. Like I lived on 30 dollars for a month last time, this time I'm going to show what it's like to live as an idol trainee in South Korea for a month on 'Face Paper'.\\" Lee Yoo-mi and Seo Jin-ah seemed not to fully understand the conversation between me and Bang Mu-hyuk. [It's not normal to understand this conversation at fourteen. I'm a very special case.] I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Just uploading the trainee life could be interesting, but wouldn't it be better if there was a clear goal like last time?\\" Bang Mu-hyuk indeed had a sharp point. \\"Making it into the debut team within a month as a trainee. How about that?\\" \\"It's an impossible mission, but it would definitely grab people's attention, wouldn't it?\\" \\"Right?\\" I was already excited about uploading this content on 'Face Paper'. Bang Mu-hyuk served us more tteokbokki. \\"Start your diet tomorrow, eat a lot today.\\" \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" Lee Yoo-mi and Seo Jin-ah slurped down the tteokbokki. For idol trainees in South Korea, dieting was a harder task than calculus. \\"By the way, Seong-guk. Can you follow the training starting tomorrow?\\" [Is Bang Mu-hyuk worried I can't keep up?] Bang Mu-hyuk drove the point home. \\"Just because you're a Harvard honor student doesn't mean you'll be a JP honor student.\\" My competitive spirit, which had been sleeping inside me, began to flare up. \\"I'll try. No, I can do it!\\" * * * \\"Bro, how can you do it like that? Look, your body should move according to the song. Try following me.\\" [Sigh, to think I'd learn dancing from Min-guk. Min-guk, do you know I trained you to be selected as a child actor? Don't you know?] Min-guk frowned and lost his temper. \\"Bro! Why can't you follow this simple thing!\\" [I think he remembers when I scolded him before.] I stopped dancing. \\"Jeon Min-guk. I'm your brother. Are you angry with me?\\" [Do you know who's allowing you to live comfortably in this house?] It was another version of that statement. Min-guk looked at me with a slightly apologetic expression. \\"Bro, it's not that... you're just really bad.\\" Despair. It felt like the word was stamped right above my head. [I, Jeon Seong-guk, have something I'm bad at....] Min-guk glanced at me and then softened his voice. \\"Bro, try following me.\\" I followed Min-guk, recalling what teacher Lee Seo-rin said yesterday, and tried to wave from my head, chest, pelvis, to stomach, but failed. \\"Sigh-.\\" I let out a long sigh. Min-guk came over and sat next to me. \\"Bro, I thought there was nothing you couldn't do in this world. But you're really a dance klutz. How are you going to become a JP trainee like this?\\" Even Min-guk was dismissing my skills. I clenched my teeth hard. Min-guk patted my shoulder. \\"Bro, it's no use. Let's give up on being an idol.\\" \\"Min-guk, I'm not practicing to become an idol. I'm just doing a 'Face Paper' project. It's about continuously showing something to people for a month. A month might seem short, but it can also be a time to change your life.\\" Min-guk probably didn't understand everything I said. \\"I don't get what you're saying.\\" [Min-guk, this kid, is already rebelling now that he's grown up.] \\"Bro, with these skills, you might get kicked out of JP not in a month but in a week. Let's start practicing again.\\" \\"Okay, got it.\\" I got up again and started learning to dance while being criticized by Min-guk. * * * - January 1, 2004. Will effort truly not betray? Also heading to JP practice room on day 1. I uploaded this post along with my video on 'Face Paper', and comments started pouring in like crazy. - Seong-guk, anyone can dream. But few achieve them. - Are you cleaning at JP? You look exactly like you're cleaning.... - With those dance skills, you shouldn't have said anything to Mark at the Halloween party! - Seong-guk, we love you just the way you are. - Looks like we're going to witness Seong-guk's first failure? The last one was a comment from Mark in Europe. Mark was traveling around Europe. I played the video over and over again. It felt like my first failure in life was right in front of me. Click. Min-guk burst into the room. \\"Jeon Min-guk, you should knock before entering.\\" \\"Bro, were you watching something weird?\\" \\"What? No.\\" Thud thud thud. Without waiting for my answer, Min-guk ran to the kitchen. I could hear Min-guk shouting from outside. \\"Mom! Bro is watching weird videos!\\" \\"What?\\" At the same time, I heard mom rushing over. \\"Seong-guk, what is Min-guk talking about?\\" \\"Mom, I wasn't watching anything weird. I was watching the video of today's practice.\\" For a moment, mom and Min-guk's eyes sparkled. As if they had found prey. \\"Seong-guk, mom is really curious about your practice. Show me.\\" \\"Ah, mom. Look at this. Bro, you dance terribly. Oh my God!\\" Min-guk had already rushed to the laptop and was showing mom the video. [Jeon Min-guk, you wait and see.] Mom watched my video and smiled. \\"Oh my, our Seong-guk has things he can't do too.\\" Despair. It seemed I looked terrible in mom's eyes too. \\"Seong-guk, just think of it as making friends and experiencing new things for a month.\\" Mom patted my back. Next to her, Min-guk stuck out his tongue and teased me. \\"I'm cooking now, so come out in a bit.\\" \\"Okay, mom.\\" As Min-guk was about to follow mom out, I grabbed him by the nape of his neck. \\"Bro, what's wrong?\\" \\"Jeon Min-guk, shall we study math together?\\" \\"Uh...?\\" Min-guk's face stiffened. \\"Didn't I say that even if you're not smart, you can get to the middle if you study hard?\\" \\"Ye-eah. Mom and dad said I'm smart. I just don't try hard enough.\\" \\"Then, shall we try hard together with that smart brain of yours?\\" \\"Bro, I'm hungry.\\" \\"Before eating, 30 minutes. After eating, 30 minutes. Go get your math book. Otherwise, I'll make sure you can't watch JP anymore.\\" \\"No, that can't happen. Okay, bro. I'll go get my book from my room.\\" Min-guk ran off to his room. I slightly lifted the corners of my mouth. [This is how you do revenge.] * * * - January 1, 2004. Will effort really not betray?

Pomimo że te przekonania są częścią wierzeń astrologicznych, nie ma naukowych dowodów sugerujących, że ruchy planetarnego ciała mogą mieć wpływ na rynki finansowe, w tym na cenę Bitcoina. Analizując zachowanie cen Bitcoina lub jakiegokolwiek innego aktywa finansowego, zazwyczaj stosuje się analizę techniczną i fundamentalną. Analiza techniczna skupia się na wzorcach cenowych i wolumenach transakcji, podczas gdy analiza fundamentalna bada podstawowe czynniki ekonomiczne, takie jak podaż i popyt, wiadomości dotyczące regulacji prawnych dotyczących kryptowalut, zmiany gospodarcze, itp. Jeżeli chodzi o cenę Bitcoina w okresach uznawanych za retrogradację Merkurego, to wszelkie obserwacje dotyczące zachowania cen mogłyby być raczej zbieżne niż wynikiem bezpośredniego wpływu tego zjawiska. Rynki mogą być niestabilne z wielu powodów, w tym z powodu zmian nastrojów inwestorów, wiadomości dotyczących regulacji, wprowadzenia nowych technologii, czy nawet globalnych wydarzeń ekonomicznych i politycznych. Należy pamiętać, że kryptowaluty, w tym Bitcoin, są niezwykle zmienne i ich ceny mogą się gwałtownie zmieniać bez wyraźnego powodu lub w wyniku wielu czynników. Inwestorzy i spekulanci powinni podejmować decyzje inwestycyjne oparte na solidnej analizie i rozważnym zarządzaniu ryzykiem, zamiast polegać na astrologicznych teoriach. Podsumowując, z perspektywy naukowej i finansowej, nie ma potwierdzenia, że retrogradacja Merkurego ma bezpośredni wpływ na cenę Bitcoina czy jakiegokolwiek innego aktywa finansowego. Interpretacje oparte na astrologii nie są częścią tradycyjnych metod analizy stosowanych na rynkach finansowych."},{"prompt":"jednak sprawdz w jakim okresie bylo zjawisko retrogradacji i nanies ten okres na cene bitcoina i zrob analize jakie wnioski mozna z tego wyciagnac","completion":"Wyjaśnię proces analizy, który możemy podjąć, aby zbadać potencjalny wpływ retrogradacji Merkurego na cenę Bitcoina, ale należy pamiętać, że bez konkretnych dat retrogradacji Merkurego i danych historycznych ceny Bitcoina nie mogę dostarczyć precyzyjnej analizy. Mogę jednak opisać, jak można by to zrobić krok po kroku. # 1. Zbierz dane Pierwszym krokiem jest zebranie dat retrogradacji Merkurego wraz z historycznymi danymi cenowymi Bitcoina. Retrogradacje Merkurego zdarzają się kilka razy w roku i trwają około trzech tygodni. Historyczne dane cen Bitcoina są szeroko dostępne na wielu platformach finansowych i stronach poświęconych kryptowalutom. # 2. Dopasowanie dat Następnie dopasowujesz daty retrogradacji Merkurego do historycznego wykresu cen Bitcoina, zaznaczając te okresy na wykresie. Ta wizualna reprezentacja pomoże zidentyfikować, czy występują jakieś zauważalne tendencje cenowe podczas tych okresów w porównaniu z innymi okresami. # 3. Analiza techniczna Wykorzystując narzędzia analizy technicznej, możesz teraz dokładniej zbadać zachowanie cen Bitcoina podczas każdego okresu retrogradacji Merkurego. Szukaj wzorców takich jak zmiany cen, zwiększone wolumeny handlu, formacje świecowe itp. # 4. Ocena wyników Oceń, czy wystąpiły jakiekolwiek istotne zmiany w cenach Bitcoina, które można by przypisać okresom retrogradacji Merkurego. Ważne jest, aby pamiętać o różnicy między korelacją a przyczynowością; nawet jeśli możemy zaobserwować wzorce, niekoniecznie oznacza to, że retrogradacja Merkurego ma bezpośredni wpływ na rynek Bitcoina. # Przykładowe wnioski Po przeprowadzeniu tej analizy, możesz dojść do jednego z kilku wniosków: - Nie ma znaczącej korelacji między retrogradacją Merkurego a ceną Bitcoina. - Istnieje korelacja, ale jest ona słaba i może wynikać z przypadku lub innych czynników zewnętrznych. - Występuje wyraźna korelacja, ale nie jest jasne, czy retrogradacja Merkurego jest przyczyną, czy tylko współwystępuje z innymi czynnikami wpływającymi na rynek. # Podsumowanie Chociaż można przeprowadzić powyższą analizę, ważne jest, aby pamiętać, że rynki finansowe są złożone i wpływane przez nieskończoną liczbę zmiennych. Sugerowanie, że pojedyncze astrologiczne zjawisko mogłoby mieć znaczący i konsekwentny wpływ na cenę Bitcoina, byłoby niezwykle trudne do udowodnienia z perspektywy empirycznej. W świetle obecnej wiedzy, każdy zauważony wzorzec prawdopodobnie należałoby traktować jako ciekawostkę, a nie jako podstawę do podejmowania decyzji inwestycyjnych."},{"prompt":"Explain in detail how to use LangChain with python","completion":"LangChain is a library that allows users to easily interact with Chainlink's external adapters using Python. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use LangChain with Python: 1. First, you will need to install LangChain using pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: \`\`\` pip install langchain \`\`\` 2. Next, you will need to set up a Chainlink node that is connected to the Ethereum network. You can follow the official Chainlink documentation to set up your own node. 3. Once your Chainlink node is set up, you will need to create a job specification for the external adapter you want to interact with. This job specification will include details such as the adapter's URL, input parameters, and output format. 4. After creating the job specification, you will need to deploy it to your Chainlink node. You can do this using the Chainlink node's user interface or command line interface. 5. Now, you can start using LangChain in your Python code. Here is an example of how to use LangChain to make a request to an external adapter: \`\`\`python from langchain import ChainlinkClient # Set up the Chainlink client client = ChainlinkClient( node_url='https://your.chainlink.node.url', job_id='your_job_id', access_key='your_access_key', secret='your_secret' ) # Define the input parameters for the external adapter input_params = { 'param1': 'value1', 'param2': 'value2' } # Make a request to the external adapter result = client.request(input_params) # Print the result print(result) \`\`\` In this example, you will need to replace the placeholders ('https://your.chainlink.node.url', 'your_job_id', 'your_access_key', 'your_secret') with your own Chainlink node URL, job ID, access key, and secret. 6. Finally, run your Python code and you should see the result of the request to the external adapter printed to the console. That's it! You have successfully used LangChain with Python to interact with Chainlink's external adapters."},{"prompt":"Write a list of animated films from the year 2010, and for each film, write a plot synopsis for that film with the least amount of words possible.","completion":"1. **Toy Story 3**: Toys face daycare. 2. **How to Train Your Dragon**: Boy befriends dragon. 3. **Tangled**: Long-haired princess escapes. 4. **Despicable Me**: Villain adopts girls. 5. **Megamind**: Villain becomes hero. 6. **Shrek Forever After**: Shrek alters reality. 7. **The Illusionist**: Magician's fading career. 8. **Legend of The Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole**: Owl battles evil. 9. **Alpha and Omega**: Wolves journey home. 10. **Fantastic Mr. Fox**: Fox vs. farmers."},{"prompt":"Вопрос: Множество натуральных чисел замкнуто относительно операции… Тип ответа: Одиночный выбор • с выбором одного правильного ответа из нескольких предложенных вариантов сложения вычитания извлечения корней деления","completion":"сложения"},{"prompt":"Вопрос: Сколькими способами можно выбрать гласную и согласную буквы из слова «схема»?","completion":"Сначала разделим буквы слова «схема» на гласные и согласные.

Выбор 3 цветов из 5 можно сделать способом, который в комбинаторике называется сочетанием и обозначается (C_n^k), где (n) - общее количество объектов, а (k) - количество выбираемых объектов. Формула для нахождения сочетаний выглядит так: (C_n^k = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}), где (n!) обозначает факториал числа (n). В данной задаче (n=5), а (k=3): [C_5^3 = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5!}{3!2!} = frac{(5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1)}{(3 times 2 times 1)(2 times 1)} = frac{120}{12} = 10.] Таким образом, выбрать 3 цвета из 5 можно 10 способами. Далее, учитывая, что расположение цветов важно (перестановки), необходимо умножить получившееся число выборов на количество способов расположить 3 выбранных цвета. Поскольку есть 3 различных цвета, которые мы можем расставить по 3 различным позициям, то количество таких перестановок будет обозначаться как (P_3 = 3!)

[내가. 천하의 전성국이. 못하는 게 있다니….] 민국이가 내 눈치를 살피더니 목소리를 한결 부드럽게 냈다. “형, 나를 좀 따라 해 봐.” 나는 민국이를 따라서 어제 이서린 선생님의 말을 떠올리며 머리, 가슴, 골반, 배로 웨이브를 탔지만 좌절. “하아-.” 한숨을 길게 뱉었다. 민국이가 옆으로 오더니 내 옆에 쪼그리고 앉았다. “형, 나는 형이 이 세상에서 못하는 게 없는 사람인 줄 알았거든. 근데 형은 정말 몸치야. 이렇게 해서 어떻게 JP 연습생이 되겠다는 거야?” 민국이에게도 무시받는 실력이라니. 나는 이를 꽉 깨물었다. 민국이가 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “형, 안 되겠어. 아이돌은 포기하자.” “성국아, 나 아이돌 되려고 연습하는 거 아니야. 난 단지… ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 프로젝트 하는 거야. 한 달 동안 뭔가를 사람들에게 계속 보여주는 거야. 한 달이 짧다 하면 짧을 수 있지만, 인생을 바꿀 수도 있는 시간이거든.” 민국이가 내가 하는 말을 다 알아들을 리 만무했다. “뭔 소리인지 모르겠고.” [민국이 이 녀석, 컸다고 벌써 반항하네.] “형, 이 실력으로는 한 달이 아니라 일주일 만에 JP에서 쫓겨날 수도 있어. 다시 연습 시작하자.” “어, 알았어.” 나는 다시 일어나서 민국이에게 지적질을 당하며 춤을 배우기 시작했다. * - 대한민국 JP 연습생 1일 차. 가창 D. 댄스 D-. 이 실력으로 데뷔조에 들 수 있을까? 30일 프로젝트 시작! 내가 이 글을 나의 동영상과 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올리자 댓글들이 미친 듯이 달리기 시작했다. - 성국아, 꿈은 아무나 꾸는 거야. 이루는 사람은 적은 법이고. - JP에서 청소하는 거 아니지? 꼭 청소하는 모습 같은데…. - 저 춤 실력이면 할로윈 파티 때 마크한테 뭐라고 할 게 아닌데! - 성국, 우리는 너를 있는 모습 그대로 사랑해. - 성국이 최초의 실패를 보겠는데? 마지막은 유럽에 있는 마크의 댓글이었다. 마크는 유럽 각지를 여행 중이었다. 나는 동영상을 돌리고 또 돌렸다. 진짜 전성국 인생 최초의 실패가 눈앞에 있는 것 같았다. 달칵. 민국이가 문을 벌컥 열고 들어왔다. “전민국, 노크하고 들어와야지.” “형, 이상한 거 보고 있었어?” “뭐라고? 아니야.” 후다다닥. 민국이는 내 대답도 안 듣고, 부엌으로 뛰어가고 있었다. 밖에서 민국이가 소리치는 게 들렸다. “엄마! 형아 이상한 영상 봐!” “뭐?” 동시에 엄마가 달려오는 소리도 들렸다. “성국아, 민국이가 무슨 소리 하는 거야?” “엄마, 난 이상한 거 안 봤어. 오늘 연습한 거 찍은 동영상 봤어.” 순간, 엄마와 민국이의 눈이 반짝였다. 마치 먹잇감을 발견했다는 듯이. “성국아, 엄마도 너 연습한 거 너무 궁금해. 엄마 보여줘.” “어, 엄마. 이것 봐. 형, 춤 더럽게 못 춰. 맙소사!” 민국이는 어느새 노트북으로 달려와서 엄마에게 동영상을 보여줬다. [전민국, 너 두고 보자.] 엄마는 내 동영상을 보더니 미소를 지었다. “어머, 우리 성국이가 못하는 것도 다 있네.” 좌절. 엄마 눈에도 내가 엉망으로 보이는 모양이었다. “성국아, 한 달 동안 그냥 친구들도 사귀고 새로운 경험 한다고 생각해.” 엄마는 내 등을 도닥였다. 그 옆에서 민국이가 혀를 쭉 내밀며 메롱을 했다. “지금 밥하니까 조금 있다 나와.” “어, 엄마.” 민국이도 엄마를 따라 나가려는 순간, 나는 민국이의 목덜미를 잡아챘다. “형, 왜 그래?” “전민국, 형이랑 산수 공부 좀 해볼까?” “어…?” 민국이의 얼굴이 굳는 게 보였다. “형이 머리가 나빠도 공부 열심히 하면 중간은 간다고 했지?” “혀엉. 엄마, 아빠가 그러는데, 나 머리는 좋대. 노력을 안 해서 그렇지.” “그럼, 그 좋은 머리로 형과 함께 노력도 해볼까?” “형, 나 배가 고파서.” “밥 먹기 전에 30분. 밥 먹고 30분. 어서 산수 책 가지고 와. 안 그러면, JP 구경 없던 걸로 할 거야.” “어, 안 돼. 그건 절대 안 돼. 알았어, 형. 방에서 책 가지고 올게.” 민국이는 후다닥 방으로 뛰어갔다. 나는 입꼬리를 슬쩍 올렸다. [복수는 이렇게 하는 거지.] * * - 2004년 1월 1일. 노력은 과연 배신하지 않을까? 오늘도 JP 연습실 출근. 나는 안무 연습실 거울 앞에 서서 일명 거울샷을 찍어서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올렸다. 존잘이라든지, 너무 잘생겼다는 말은 이제 지겨울 정도로 달렸다. 나는 텅 빈 연습실에서 음악을 틀었다. 그리고 완전히 음악에 온몸을 맡겼다. 둠치둠치. 둠치둠치. 두둠치. [그래, 이거야!] 텅 빈 연습실. 꽉 채운 사운드. 그동안 나를 옭아맸던 전직 재벌이라는 체면의 굴레를 벗어던지고…. 달칵. 누가 들어오는 소리에 나는 온몸이 굳고 말았다. [누가 감히 내 연습을 방해하는 거야?] “어? 성국이 아니야?” 뒤돌아본 곳에는 예진이가 있었다. “어, 누나?” “성국이 맞지? 방학 때 연습생으로 온다더니 진짜 왔네.” “네. 누나는 어쩐 일이세요? 오늘 1월 1일이잖아요.” “나도 연습하러 나왔어. 집에서 할 일도 별로 없고 해서. 새로 온 연습생 중에 엄청 잘생긴 애 있다고 해서 너 같다는 생각은 했어.” 예진이는 저번에 봤을 때보다 한결 성숙해 있었다. 까만 긴 머리를 한 갈래로 묶은 얼굴은 여전히 터질 듯 귀여웠다. “누나는 다행히 안 잘렸네요?” “응. 다행히 안 잘렸어. 나도 그동안 연습 많이 했거든. 근데 방금 너, 뭐 한 거야?” 순간 동공이 흔들렸다. [뭐 한 거냐니. 나 춤춘 건데….] “설마, 춤춘 거야?” “…….” 인정을 해도 문제, 안 해도 문제인 질문이었다. “풉, 성국아. 너 정말 몸치구나. 내가 가르쳐줄까? 나도 몸치라서 탈출하는 데 오래 걸렸거든.” “누나도 연습해야 하는 거 아니에요?” “원래 누구 도와주면서 하면 나도 늘잖아.” 예진이 웃으면서 다가왔다. 그러고는 한 갈래로 묶은 머리를 풀어서 흔들었다. 갑자기 공기 중에 향긋한 냄새가 퍼졌다. [이건 무슨 향수지?] 모든 게 아늑해지더니, 세상의 공기가 바뀌는 느낌이었다. 나는 예진을 다시 쳐다봤다. 이상하게 심장이 슬금슬금 빨라졌다. 두근. 두근. 두두근. [설마 이거… 부정맥인가?!]","completion":"Episode 116 In front of me sat Serene Seo Jin-ah and haughty Yoo Mi, both seated. In front of us, the spicy rice cakes bubbled away. The spot was arranged by Bang Moo-hyuk. \\"Sung-guk, you’ve lived abroad for so long... And you don’t have friends your age. It’d be nice if you got along well with Yoo Mi and Jin-ah since you're the same age. They could introduce you to Korean youth culture…” [Korean youth culture? What? Being ostracized?] My eyes narrowed. Just before, a tall male student had tested my patience several times. For debut, it was normal to constantly compete with fellow trainees. Therefore, for a new face like me, renowned for my perfect looks and impressive specs, there was some hostility. Yoo Mi began eating the spicy rice cakes with a broad smile. \\"Sung-guk, did you really attend Harvard?\\" \\"Yeah. You’ve seen my articles.\\" \\"I have, but it's my first time seeing a genius like you.\\" \\"Plus, you’re tall… You totally look like an adult.\\" Seo Jin-ah agreed. [Do you kids even know how old I am?] Bang Moo-hyuk placed a cola in front of me. \\"Here, minors should drink cola.\\" [Ah, resorting to cola as a minor. Maybe I should drown my sorrows in cola tonight, for the first time ever after receiving a D!] I gulped down the cola. Seo Jin-ah asked Bang Moo-hyuk with a sly look. \\"PD-nim, when did you first meet Sung-guk?\\" \\"Ah, a few years back in New York, Beom-sun introduced him to me. You all know Beom-sun, right?\\" \\"Yes! He’s a member of <Just>.\\" \\"Right. I was in New York with Beom-sun, and we met Sung-guk by chance at a restaurant. Then, Sung-guk and I went to a gallery and spent a lot of time together.\\" \\"Awesome.\\" Even the sly Seo Jin-ah was astounded. \\"Really awesome, right? By the way, you girls need to help Sung-guk a lot. Since he’s never attended school in Korea, he might be quite clumsy with social relationships.\\" Yoo Mi asked while chewing her spicy rice cakes. \\"Sung-guk, how much do you need to study to get into Harvard?\\" [To the point of getting a heat rash on your bottom.] Would saying this make me seem old-fashioned? \\"I was always top of my class in boarding school, or high school in America. There's something called the SAT, similar to Korea’s college entrance exam. You need to score really high on that too… American universities look at extracurricular activities as well. Developing ‘Face Paper’ helped a lot with my application.\\" \\"What’s ‘Face Paper’?\\" \\"It's like Dotori World, a social networking service (SNS) here.\\" \\"Wow, you're really amazing.\\" [Well, it's just this much.] For the first time in a while, I slurped down the spicy rice cakes. In my past life, I couldn’t even eat such \\"junk food.\\" [Why did they keep such delicious food away from me?] The taste was truly eye-opening. \\"By the way, Sung-guk. Are you going to post the video you asked me to on 'Face Paper'?\\" I had asked Bang Moo-hyuk to send me the file of today’s practice to post on 'Face Paper.' \\"Yes. Just like the challenge of living a month on 30 dollars, this time I’m going to try living as an idol trainee in Korea for a month and share it on 'Face Paper'.\\" Yoo Mi and Seo Jin-ah seemed not to fully grasp our conversation. [Normally, it wouldn't be common for a fourteen-year-old to understand this discussion. I am a very special case.] I shrugged my shoulders. “Just uploading daily trainee life could be interesting, but having a clear goal like last time would be better, right?” Bang Moo-hyuk's insight was sharp as always. \\"Surviving as a trainee for a month and making it to the debut team. How about that?\\" \\"It'd be an impossible mission but it will definitely catch people’s attention.\\" \\"Right?\\" Excited about uploading this content on 'Face Paper,' I was already bubbling with enthusiasm. Bang Moo-hyuk served us more spicy rice cakes. \\"Start your diet tomorrow, go ahead and eat a lot now.\\" \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" Yoo Mi and Seo Jin-ah slurped down their spicy rice cakes. For aspiring idols in Korea, dieting was a more difficult task than calculus. \\"By the way, Sung-guk. Will you be able to follow the training starting tomorrow?\\" [Is Bang Moo-hyuk worried I won’t be able to keep up?] Bang Moo-hyuk delivered the finishing blow. \\"Being an honor student at Harvard doesn't make you top at JP.\\" Fwooosh. A competitive fire that had been sleeping within me started to blaze. \\"I'll try. No, I can do it!\\" * * \\"Bro, why are you doing it like that? Look, your body needs to move with the song. Try following me.\\" [Ah, to think I'm learning how to dance from Min-guk. Min-guk, do you know I’m the one who trained you to be picked for a child actor role? Don’t you?] Min-guk looked annoyed and grumbled at me. \\"Bro! Why can’t you follow this simple move!\\" [I think he remembers the times I scolded him?] I stopped dancing. \\"Jun Min-guk. I’m your brother. Are you angry at me?\\" [Do you know you’re living comfortably in this house all because of who?] Another version of my usual line. Min-guk looked at me slightly apologetically. \\"Bro, it’s not that… you’re just really bad.\\" Despair. It felt like the word was firmly planted above my head. [I, the unparalleled Jeon Sung-guk, am bad at something...] Min-guk checked my reaction and then softened his voice. \\"Bro, let’s give up on becoming an idol.\\" \\"Sung-guk, I’m not training to become an idol. I’m just doing a 'Face Paper' project. To show people something for a month. It may seem short, but it’s enough time to change a life.\\" Min-guk couldn’t possibly understand everything I said. \\"I don’t get what you’re saying.\\" [This kid, Min-guk, showing defiance already as he grows.] \\"Bro, with your skills, you might be kicked out of JP in not even a week, not a month. Let’s start practicing again.\\" \\"Okay, got it.\\" I got back up and started learning to dance again under Min-guk’s critical eye. * - January 1, 2004. Can hard work truly not betray you? Day 1 as a JP trainee. With skills rated D in singing and D- in dancing, can I make it to the debut team? The 30-day project begins! As I posted this along with my video on 'Face Paper,' comments started to flood in like crazy. - Sung-guk, anyone can dream. But only a few can make it a reality. - Are you cleaning at JP? You totally look like you’re cleaning…. - With those dance skills, you shouldn’t have teased Mark at the Halloween party! - Sung-guk, we love you just the way you are. - Watching Sung-guk’s first failure seems interesting? The last comment was from Mark, traveling around Europe. I played the video over and over. It seemed like my life’s first failure was looming before me. Click. Min-guk burst open the door. \\"Jun Min-guk, you should knock before entering.\\" \\"Bro, were you watching something weird?\\" \\"What? No.\\" Thud thud thud. Without waiting for my response, Min-guk ran to the kitchen. I could hear him shouting from outside. \\"Mom! Bro is watching something weird!\\" \\"What?\\" At the same time, Mom's approaching footsteps could be heard. \\"Sung-guk, what is Min-guk talking about?\\" \\"Mom, I wasn’t watching anything weird. It was just a video of today’s practice.\\" Suddenly, both Mom’s and Min-guk’s eyes sparkled. As if they found their prey. \\"Sung-guk, Mom is really curious about your practice. Show me.\\" \\"Look, Mom. Bro dances terribly. Gosh!\\" Min-guk rushed over with my laptop and showed Mom the video. [Jun Min-guk, you just wait.] Mom smiled upon seeing the video. \\"Oh my, our Sung-guk has things he’s bad at too.\\" Despair. Even in Mom's eyes, it seemed I was a mess. \\"Sung-guk, just think of it as making friends and experiencing new things for a month.\\" Mom patted my back. Beside her, Min-guk stuck out his tongue and teased me. \\"I’m making dinner, so come out in a bit.\\" \\"Okay, Mom.\\" As Min-guk was about to follow Mom, I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck. \\"Bro, what’s wrong?\\" \\"Jun Min-guk, shall we study some math together?\\" \\"Uh…?\\" Min-guk’s face hardened. \\"Didn’t I say that if you study hard, even if you’re not smart, you can still manage to do well?\\" \\"Waaah. But Dad and Mom said I'm smart. I just don’t try hard enough.\\" \\"Then, let's use that smart brain and make an effort together.\\" \\"Bro, I’m hungry.\\" \\"Before eating, 30 minutes. After eating, another 30 minutes. Go get your math book. If not, forget about visiting JP.\\" \\"No, that can’t happen. Fine, bro. I’ll get my book from my room.\\" Min-guk dashed off to his room. I slightly curled the corners of my lips. [This is how you take revenge.] * * - January 1, 2004. Does effort truly not betray? Attending JP practice room on day 1. I stood in front of the dance studio mirror, took a selfie, also known as a mirror shot, and posted it on 'Face Paper.' Being called handsome was already becoming too common to excite me. I played music in the empty practice room. And surrendered my entire body to the music. Doom chit doom chit. Doom chit doom chit. Do doom chit. [Yes, this is it!] An empty practice room. The sound filling it up. Letting go of the dignity that restrained me as a former wealthy man... Click. The sound of someone entering made my body freeze. [Who dares to interrupt my practice?] “Oh? Isn’t that Sung-guk?” I turned around to see Ye-jin. “Oh, sister?” “It is you, Sung-guk? I heard you joined as a trainee during the break, but you really did come.” “Yes. What brings you here today, sister? It's January 1st.” “I came for practice too. There wasn’t much to do at home. And I thought it’d be you when I heard there was a super handsome new trainee.” Ye-jin looked more mature than when I last saw her. Her black long hair, tied in a single ponytail, still adorably framed her about-to-burst cute face. “Lucky you weren’t cut, sis.” “Yeah, luckily. I’ve practiced a lot since then. But, what were you doing just now?” Suddenly, my pupils wavered. [What was I doing... I was dancing...] “Don’t tell me, dancing?” “…” It was a problematic question whether I acknowledged it or not. “Pfft, Sung-guk. You really can’t dance. Should I teach you? It took me a long time to escape being a non-dancer too.” “Aren’t you supposed to practice too, sister?” “It’s okay. I improve while helping others too.” Ye-jin approached with a smile and untied her hair, shaking it. Suddenly, a fragrant scent filled the air. [What kind of perfume is this?] Everything felt cozy, as if the air around the world had changed. I looked at Ye-jin again. Weirdly, my heart started to beat faster. Thump. Thump. Thu-thump. [Could this be... arrhythmia?!]"},{"prompt":"traduci in italiano, comportati da investitore crypto e dammi le tue ocnsiderazioni \\"I believe the crypto market is going to peak in 2024. I've said that a lot and whenever I say that, I get a lot of pushback from people who they are looking at past history and they're seeing, oh wait a second, no, we're supposed to peak the year after the having. That's how it always works. So that's how it's gonna work this time. And my question to you who believes such a thing is why? Why do we have to follow the same exact pattern that we've always been following? I mean, Bitcoin did reach an all time high already before the having. So we're obviously not following the same exact steps that we've fallen in the path. I've talked about this before, I'll say it again. The price action that we're seeing right now is very much reminiscent of January or February of 2021, which was seven or eight months after the previous Bitcoin having in 2020. This is the total three crypto market cap. In other words, the total market cap minus Bitcoin and Ethereum. We had this breakout right here of the two, three, six reach rates from the bear market bottom to the previous cycle top. And then we've just gone straight up with Altcoin. And right here is what that looked like in January of 2021. Look at what happened afterwards. We went much higher and we reached the peak of euphoria in April and May of 2021. We did have a summer low right here with Altcoins and then put in a higher high in the fall of 2021. Or excuse me, the fourth quarter of 2021 for those of you in the Southern hemisphere. So if we were going along as planned, all of this wouldn't be happening until about eight to 10 months from now. And what we would be doing was we would just be dragging along right here, but that's not what's happening. And so as of right now, I think that we're going to see something like this happening with Ethereum leading up to the spot, Ethereum ETF deadline, which is on May 23rd. And if that happens, I mean, we're very much overbought right now, but at that time, we would be dramatically overbought. We would be seeing a pretty significant correction into the summer before another move up in the fall. And then that would be the peak. But then after that, 20, 25, 20, 26, things are going to get pretty ugly. That's what I think at least. I've talked about this a hundred times in my channels and live streams. Every time the Fed cuts rates after raising rates dramatically, we enter into a recession. And some of you are going to say we've already been in a recession. My response to that is if we've been in a recession, what we have looking forward is going to be much worse than that. I would say worse than 2008, not as bad as the Great Depression, but that's just my opinion. And considering the fact that Bitcoin has never actually existed in a recession, I'm not too excited for 2025 or 20, 26. \\"","completion":"\\"Credo che il mercato delle criptovalute raggiungerà il picco nel 2024. L'ho detto molte volte e ogni volta che lo dico, ricevo molte critiche da persone che guardano alla storia passata e vedono, oh un attimo, no, dovremmo raggiungere il picco l'anno successivo all'halving. È sempre funzionato così. Quindi, funzionerà anche questa volta in questo modo. La mia domanda per te che credi una cosa del genere è: perché? Perché dobbiamo seguire lo stesso identico modello che abbiamo sempre seguito? Intendo, Bitcoin ha già raggiunto un massimo storico prima dell'halving. Quindi, ovviamente non stiamo seguendo gli stessi esatti passi che abbiamo seguito in passato. Ne ho parlato prima, lo dirò di nuovo. L'azione sui prezzi che stiamo vedendo adesso è molto simile a quella di gennaio o febbraio 2021, che erano sette o otto mesi dopo l'ultimo halving di Bitcoin nel 2020. Questa è la capitalizzazione di mercato totale delle cripto, esclusi Bitcoin ed Ethereum. Abbiamo avuto questa rottura qui dei ritracciamenti del due tre sei dal fondo del mercato orso al top del ciclo precedente. E poi siamo andati dritti su con le Altcoin. E proprio qui è quello che è successo in gennaio del 2021. Guarda cosa è successo dopo. Siamo andati molto più in alto e abbiamo raggiunto il picco di euforia in aprile e maggio del 2021. Abbiamo avuto un minimo estivo qui con le Altcoin e poi abbiamo segnato un massimo più alto nell'autunno del 2021. O scusate, nel quarto trimestre del 2021 per chi è nell'emisfero sud. Quindi, se tutto procedesse come previsto, tutto questo non sarebbe accaduto fino a circa otto o dieci mesi da ora. E quello che faremmo sarebbe solo trascinarci lungo qui, ma non è quello che sta accadendo. Perciò, al momento, penso che vedremo qualcosa del genere accadere con Ethereum che conduce fino alla scadenza dell'ETF su Ethereum al contante, che è il 23 maggio. E se ciò accade, intendo, siamo molto sovracomprati ora, ma in quel momento, saremmo drammaticamente sovracomprati. Vedremmo una correzione piuttosto significativa durante l'estate prima di un altro movimento al rialzo in autunno. E poi quello sarebbe il picco. Ma dopo quello, 2025, 2026, le cose diventeranno piuttosto brutte. Questo è ciò che penso almeno. Ne ho parlato centinaia di volte nei miei canali e live stream. Ogni volta che la Fed taglia i tassi dopo averli aumentati drasticamente, entriamo in una recessione. E alcuni di voi diranno che siamo già stati in una recessione. La mia risposta a ciò è che se siamo stati in una recessione, quello che ci aspetta sarà molto peggio di così. Direi peggio del 2008, non così malvagio come la Grande Depressione, ma questa è solo la mia opinione. E considerando il fatto che Bitcoin non ha mai effettivamente esistito durante una recessione, non sono troppo entusiasta per il 2025 o il 2026.\\" Considerazioni come investitore crypto: Basandomi su queste analisi e proiezioni, si può osservare che c'è un'attesa di volatilità e di eventuali correggimenti nel breve termine, specialmente attorno al 2023 e 2024. Tuttavia, ciò che mi colpisce di più è l'avvertimento sui potenziali anni difficili dopo il 2024, in particolare in relazione al ciclo economico e alle azioni della Fed. Come investitore crypto, questo mi suggerisce la necessità di essere estremamente cauti e di avere una strategia di investimento ben ponderata, che possa includere la diversificazione non solo all'interno del settore delle criptovalute, ma anche in altri asset e settori per ridurre il rischio. Inoltre, l'importanza di monitorare da vicino i movimenti di mercato e le politiche economiche mondiali diventa evidente, perché potranno avere un impatto significativo sulle prestazioni delle criptovalute. In tempi di incertezza economica, mantenere una certa liquidità potrebbe anche essere saggio per poter approfittare di eventuali opportunità a prezzi più bassi."},{"prompt":"Write a list of animated films from 2010.

JP에서는 한 달에 한 번 월말 평가를 통해서 실력이 부족한 연습생은 자르고, 실력이 향상된 연습생은 데뷔조로 올리기도 합니다. 한 달 동안 JP에서 연습생에서 시작해서 데뷔조로 올라가는 과정의 결과가 나오는 날이기도 합니다. 그럼, 결과는 저녁에 알려 드릴게요. 나는 평소대로 후드 티를 챙겨 입고 가방을 들었다. 데뷔조로 뽑힌 예진은 그 이후로 단 한 번도 마주치지 못했다. 가끔 안부 문자를 주고받긴 했지만, 꽉 찬 스케줄에 잠도 제대로 못 잔다는 내용이 대부분이었다. 직접 만나지 않으니 호르몬도 잠잠해졌는지 문자에 별 감흥도 없었다. [이제 전성국 인생에 여자는 없어!] 나는 잠시 흔들렸던 마음을 다잡았다. 내게 더 중요한 것은 이제 곧 사업을 키워 나갈 ‘페이스 페이퍼’였다. 똑. 똑. “누구세요?” “형, 나 민국이.” “들어와.” 민국이가 잔뜩 뿔난 얼굴로 방문을 열고 들어왔다. “형이 산수 문제집이랑 영어 문제집 풀라고 해서 그동안 열심히 풀었는데, 언제 JP 구경시켜줄 거야?” “형 오늘 중요한 평가거든. 그거 끝나고 물어볼게.” “치이, 형아 미워!” 민국이는 툴툴거리며 나갔다. [민국이 녀석도 슬슬 사춘기인가….] 요즘 아주 툴툴거리고, 내 말도 더럽게 안 들었다. 약속은 약속이니까, 붙든 떨어지든 오늘 끝나면 방무혁에게 물어보긴 해야 할 것 같았다. 띠링. 띠링. 띠링. ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 알람이 쉼 없이 도착했다. 모두 나의 성공을 기원했지만, 그 실력으로 되겠냐는 조롱도 많이 실려 있었다. 나 역시 솔직히 평소처럼 100프로 자신 있지는 않았다. “옵빠!” 지희가 졸린 눈을 비비며 애착 인형을 안고 들어왔다. “오빠. 오늘 셤 봐?” “응. 오늘 중요한 시험이 있어.” “오빠, 오늘 시혐 잘 보라고 지희가 뽀뽀해줄게.” “진짜?” 볼을 가져다 대자 지희가 내 볼에 쪽, 소리가 나게 뽀뽀를 했다. “오빠, 파이팅!” “응!” [이제부터 내 인생의 여자는 엄마랑 지희뿐이야.] * * * 나를 포함한 1년 차 미만 연습생 열 명이 연습실에 쭉 섰다. 평소 같으면 장난치고 말 걸기 바빴을 텐데, 오늘은 모두 조용했다. 긴장한 모습이 역력했다. 월말 평가로 누군 잘릴 수도 있기 때문에 중학교나 고등학교 시험처럼 단지 성적 때문에 초라해지는 자리가 아니었다. 누군가는 꿈이 좌절되는 자리이기도 했다. 나는 가볍게 몸을 풀었다. 예진이가 알려준 것처럼 팔과 다리를 풀어놔야 춤출 때 몸도 훨씬 부드럽고, 무리도 안 갔다. 이유미가 옆에서 징징거렸다. “성국아, 넌 연습 많이 했어?” “그냥 좀.” 말은 이렇게 했지만, 잠자는 시간 빼고는 다 연습에 올인했다. 달칵. 연습실의 문이 열리면서 박진수 대표와 방무혁 피디. 그리고 한소리와 이서린도 같이 들어왔다. 박진수 대표가 자리에 앉으면서 우리를 한 명 한 명 훑었다. “다들 한 달 동안 연습 많이 했어?” “네에!” 연습생들의 우렁찬 대답 소리. “긴장 너무 하지 말고. 그동안 연습한 영상, 방 피디랑 다 돌려봤어. 그래도 우리의 목표는 실제로 무대에 서는 가수잖아. 연습 때 아무리 잘해도 무대에서 한 번 실수하면 영원히 기록에 남는 거야. 그러니까 월말 평가도 실전처럼 다들 임하자.” “네에!” “자, 그럼… 서진아부터 시작할까?” “네.” 새침 서진아만 빼고 모든 연습생들은 뒤로 가서 앉았다. [왜 이렇게 심장이 뛰지.] 나는 두근거리는 심장을 진정시키며 서진아의 첫 무대를 봤다. 서진아는 익숙한 걸 그룹의 노래와 댄스를 선택했다. [저런 선택은 오히려 마이너스인데. 자기 개성을 보여줄 수 없잖아.] 서진아의 무대가 끝나자 박진수는 애매한 미소를 지었다. “진아야, 진아 보컬이 오늘 좀 묻히는 거 같은데. 댄스도 무난하고.” 서진아가 긴장하는 모습이 보였다. “방 피디는 어때?” “선곡이 오늘 좀 별로였던 것 같아. 이미 너무 익숙한 곡들이라 진아가 잘해봤자 돋보이지 않는 부분이 많아.” 역시 내 예상대로였다. “그래도 무난한 무대였어. 다음은 김찬호.” 김찬호가 등장했다. 1년 차 미만 연습생 중에서는 여러모로 가장 실력이 뛰어난 친구였다. 외모도 매력적이라 나를 제외하고는 가장 인기 있는 친구이기도 했다. 묵묵히 연습만 하는 스타일이라 연습생들과 트러블도 없었다. “어? 찬호랑 오늘 성국이 선곡이 똑같네.” 뭐라고? 김찬호는 나를 흘깃 한 번 뒤돌아보더니 그저 어깨를 으쓱했다. 스트릿 댄서 출신에다가 이미 1년 동안 연습생으로 지낸 김찬호와 내가 선곡이 똑같다니…. [이거 비교당하기 딱이잖아.] 나는 팔짱을 낀 채 최대한 포커페이스를 유지했다. “찬호야, <거짓이야>부터 불러볼까?” “네.” 곧 한소리가 건반으로 <거짓이야>를 연주하기 시작했다. * * * “역시 잘하네. 찬호가 특기가 춤이긴 한데, 보컬로도 매력 있어. 이제 댄스 시작해보자.” “네!” 김찬호는 대답을 하자마자 <완벽한 남자> 안무를 시작했다. 절도 있는 동작과 파워풀한 안무. [하아, 완벽하잖아.] 김찬호의 <완벽한 남자>는 진짜 완벽했다. 내 얼굴은 점점 절망으로 바뀌고 있었다. 하지만 실망하기에는 이르다. [김찬호와 나만의 차별점이 분명 있을 거야…. 과연… 있을까?] 나는 점점 더 절망의 구렁텅이로 빠져들고 있다. 무대를 마친 김찬호가 거친 숨을 내뱉으며 박진수 대표 앞에 섰다. “찬호 춤이야, 정말 잘 춰. 흠잡을 데가 없어. 지금 바로 무대 올라가도 되겠어.” “진짜 찬호는 보컬도 춤도 정석이야. 다들 찬호가 하는 만큼만 하면 좋겠다.” 방무혁 피디도 칭찬을 아까지 않았다. “찬호는 지금처럼만 해. 알았지?” “네, 대표님.” 김찬호가 들어가고 박진수 대표와 눈이 딱 마주쳤다. [설마 나야? 박진수, 왜 이래. 연습생 1년 차와 한 달 차를 바로 붙여서 보겠다고?] 박진수는 마치 내 마음을 알고 있다는 듯이 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국아, 준비한 거 해볼까?” 연습생들도 웅성거렸다. “어머, 같은 거 하나 봐.” “대박, 실력 차이 장난 아니게 보이겠다.” 나는 주먹을 꽉 쥐고 일어났다. “찬호랑 같은 선곡이니까, 아마 네 실력을 더 잘 확인할 수 있을 거야.” [주제 파악하란 말이구나. 박진수 대표, 잔인한데….] “자, 노래부터.” 곧이어 한소리가 건반을 쳤다. 나는 최대한 미성으로 도입부를 들어갔다. 아직 채 변성기가 오지 않은 내 목소리로 어필하는 게, 좀 더 김찬호와 차별점을 가질 것 같았다. 동시에 박진수와 방무혁이 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. 하지만 의중은 알 수 없었다. “성국아, 댄스도 찬호랑 같은 <완벽한 남자>지?” “네.” “찬호랑 비교하는 건 의미가 없겠지만, 한번 한 달 동안 얼마나 성장했는지 보여줘.” “네!” 드디어 <완벽한 남자>의 전주가 흘러나오기 시작했다. 처음엔 편하게 안무를 이어갔다. 물론 김찬호에 비하면 쓰레기 같은 실력일 게 뻔하다. 그렇다면, 승부수를 띄워야지. <완벽한 남자>가 절정으로 향해가자 긴장이 풀린 연습생들도 박수를 치며 노래를 따라 부르곤 했다. [자, 이제 승부수를 띄워볼까!] 나는 자연스레 턴을 하면서 후드 티를 훌러덩 벗어 던졌다. 그 순간 여자 연습생들의 비명이 들렸다. “아아악!” “으아악!” 동시에 박진수가 손뼉을 치며 뒤로 넘어가게 웃어댔다. * * * “성국아, 너 몸 좀 만들고 벗어야지. 그냥 벗어재끼면 어떻게 해.” 박진수는 웃음기 가득한 얼굴로 평가를 시작했다. 방무혁도 웃음을 겨우 참고 있었다. “성국아, 네 갈비뼈 잘 봤어.” “그래도 여자들한테는 효과 만점이네. 방 피디, 아까 비명 소리 들었어?” “그니까. 성국아, 이건 반칙이지. 찬호 못 이길 거 같으니까, 너 웃통 벗은 거지?” [헐, 들켰나….] 나는 머리를 긁적였다. “성국이 솔직히 아직 다 부족하지. 보컬도 부족하고, 댄스도 약하고. 근데 한 달 동안 이렇게 는 건 보통은 아니야. 거기다 하버드생에 모범생이라 무대에서 어떨까, 이런 고민 좀 했는데… 무대에서 장난 아니게 끼가 나오네. 오늘 무대는 너의 스타성을 본 것 같아서 우선 대만족이야.” “성국아, 다음부터는 반칙하지 말고 정정당당하게 승부해야 해.” [방무혁, 결과가 나쁘면 다 나쁜 거야.] 난 쑥스럽게 웃으며 후드 티를 매만졌다. “네. 노력하겠습니다.” 그러곤 자리에 털썩 주저앉았다. [하아, 정말 하얗게 불태웠어….] * * * 박진수와 방무혁, 한소리와 이서린이 한자리에 모여서 월말 평가를 진행했다. “그래도 1등은 당연히 찬호지?” “그렇지. 찬호야 실력 면에서는 이 반에서는 최고지.” 방무혁도 동의했다. “진아랑 유미도 별 무리 없고…. 근데 말이야. 다들 성국이 어떻게 생각해?” 박진수가 사뭇 진지하게 물었다. “어떻게 생각하냐니? 무슨 의미야?” “나 오늘 그 녀석한테 완전히 반했어. 실력으로는 도저히 찬호 못 이길 것 같으니까, 후드 티 벗은 거잖아. 어떻게 그런 생각을 했지?” “나도 같이 비명 질렀어요.” 이서린도 동참했다. “한소리 씨는 어때?” “보컬도 일부러 더 미성으로 부른 거 보셨죠? 성국이 역시 머리가 좋은 것 같아요. 찬호가 남자다운 매력으로 어필하니까, 자기는 보컬은 좀 더 미성으로 부르고 춤은 남성적으로 어필 딱 한 거잖아요.” “후드 티 벗는 퍼포먼스로 난 오늘 승자는 무조건 성국이에요.” 이서린이 강력하게 이야기했다. 박진수도 웃으며 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “성국이 스타성은 정말 못 당하겠어.” “근데… 걱정이 되는 게 있어.” 방무혁이 진지한 얼굴로 모두를 쳐다봤다. “방 피디, 뭐가 걱정이야?” “너무 혼자만 튀지 않아?”","completion":"Episode 118 Bang Mu-hyuk and Park Jin-soo were watching the practice videos of the trainees. \\"Should we take a look at Sung-guk's?\\" \\"Sung-guk's will be shown through his 'Face Paper'.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk clicked on Sung-guk's 'Face Paper' on his laptop. \\"Sung-guk has been posting videos here for 30 days, challenging himself to debut from being a JP trainee.\\" \\"Really, I think this kid might be a genius. It seems like he knows what people are curious about.\\" Park Jin-soo also showed interest. \\"This is the first day. It was really disastrous.\\" After watching Sung-guk's first day of vocal and dance tests, Bang Mu-hyuk clapped his hands and fell backward. \\"Wow, amazing. He's the worst among the trainees I've seen recently. He doesn't have any basics.\\" \\"Let's watch the next day's video.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk showed Park Jin-soo all the videos of Sung-guk's growth in order. Park Jin-soo's upper body leaned forward more and more. Sung-guk's videos not only showed growth but also had a strangely captivating charm. \\"Sung-guk is almost a month in, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"How did a guy with no basics at all manage to perform the choreography of 'The Perfect Man'?\\" \\"What's even more amazing is that while learning this choreography, he naturally picked up the basics of dance. Initially, he couldn't even wave, but from here on, it's incredibly natural.\\" Park Jin-soo focused especially on Sung-guk singing \\"It's a Lie.\\" \\"This kid only studied, right?\\" \\"Why do you ask?\\" \\"Don't you remember when I directed this song? I told the 'Just' members to recall the desperate emotions of being dumped by a girlfriend. But Sung-guk, although clumsy, had those emotions.\\" \\"His vocals are shaky, but I can feel the emotions too. It's hard to find kids with good emotions.\\" \\"Mu-hyuk, I'm starting to take an interest in this kid.\\" Park Jin-soo adjusted his posture. \\"We're making a 5-member male dance group this time.\\" \\"That's already filled up.\\" \\"Sung-guk being there would make it more perfect, don't you think? In my opinion, he has enough potential to be the center. If he's improved this much in just a month, wouldn't it be okay to debut him after 6 months?\\" \\"That's... up to Sung-guk's decision.\\" \\"Well, if not, there's always the next group. We'll have to keep a close eye on him during the evaluation at the end of this month.\\" Park Jin-soo couldn't take his eyes off Sung-guk's videos. * * * - Today is finally the day of the monthly evaluation. At JP, we conduct monthly evaluations to cut trainees with insufficient skills and promote those who have improved to the debut team. It's also the day when the results of the process of moving from a trainee to the debut team within a month are announced. I'll let you know the results in the evening. As usual, I grabbed my hoodie and bag. I haven't run into Ye-jin, who was selected for the debut team, even once since then. We occasionally exchanged text messages, but most of them were about how she couldn't sleep properly due to her packed schedule. Since we didn't meet in person, my hormones seemed to have calmed down, and I felt no particular excitement from the texts. [From now on, there are no women in Jeon Sung-guk's life!] I steadied my momentarily shaken heart. What was more important to me now was 'Face Paper,' which I would soon grow as a business. Knock. Knock. \\"Who is it?\\" \\"Hyung, it's Min-guk.\\" \\"Come in.\\" Min-guk entered the room with a sulky face. \\"Hyung, I've been diligently solving the math and English workbooks you told me to, but when are you going to show me around JP?\\" \\"Hyung has an important evaluation today. I'll ask him after it's over.\\" \\"Chee, I hate you, hyung!\\" Min-guk grumbled and left. [Is Min-guk entering puberty too...?] Lately, he's been grumbling a lot and not listening to me at all. Since a promise is a promise, I felt like I had to ask Bang Mu-hyuk whether I make it or not after today. Ding. Ding. Ding. Notifications from 'Face Paper' kept arriving non-stop. Everyone wished me success, but there were also many mocking comments questioning if I could really make it with my skills. Honestly, I wasn't 100% confident as usual. \\"Oppa!\\" Ji-hee entered, rubbing her sleepy eyes and hugging her stuffed animal. \\"Oppa, are you taking a test today?\\" \\"Yeah. I have an important exam today.\\" \\"Oppa, Ji-hee will give you a kiss to wish you good luck on your exam today.\\" \\"Really?\\" As I brought my cheek closer, Ji-hee kissed my cheek with a smack. \\"Oppa, fighting!\\" \\"Yeah!\\" [From now on, the only women in my life are mom and Ji-hee.] * * * Ten trainees, including me, who were less than a year into their training, stood in a line in the practice room. Normally, we would have been joking around and talking, but today everyone was quiet. The tension was palpable. The monthly evaluation could result in someone being cut, so it wasn't just a place where one felt inferior due to grades like in middle or high school. For some, it was a place where dreams were crushed. I lightly warmed up my body. As Ye-jin taught me, loosening up my arms and legs made my body much smoother when dancing, and it didn't strain as much. Yoo-mi whined next to me. \\"Sung-guk, did you practice a lot?\\" \\"Just a bit.\\" Though I said that, I had been all-in on practice except for sleeping hours. Click. The door to the practice room opened, and Park Jin-soo, the representative, Bang Mu-hyuk PD, Han So-ri, and Lee Seo-rin entered together. Park Jin-soo scanned each of us as he sat down. \\"Did you all practice a lot over the past month?\\" \\"Yes!\\" The trainees responded loudly. \\"Don't be too nervous. We've watched all your practice videos with Bang PD. But our goal is to become singers who perform on stage, right? No matter how well you do in practice, one mistake on stage remains a record forever. So, let's treat this monthly evaluation as if it's the real deal.\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Then... shall we start with Seo-jin?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Except for Seo-jin, all the trainees moved back and sat down. [Why is my heart beating so fast.] I tried to calm my pounding heart as I watched Seo-jin's first performance. Seo-jin chose a familiar girl group's song and dance. [Such a choice might actually be a minus. It doesn't show her individuality.] As Seo-jin's performance ended, Park Jin-soo gave an ambiguous smile. \\"Seo-jin, your vocals seemed a bit buried today. The dance was also just okay.\\" Seo-jin looked nervous. \\"What do you think, Bang PD?\\" \\"The song selection was a bit off today. The songs are too familiar, so even if Seo-jin did well, it wouldn't stand out much.\\" Just as I expected. \\"But it was a decent performance. Next, Kim Chan-ho.\\" Kim Chan-ho appeared. Among the trainees of less than a year, he was the most talented in many ways. He was also attractive, making him the most popular friend besides me. He was the type to quietly focus on practice, so he didn't have any trouble with other trainees. \\"Uh? Chan-ho and Sung-guk chose the same song today.\\" What? Kim Chan-ho glanced back at me once and then just shrugged. A street dancer by origin, Kim Chan-ho had been a trainee for a year already... [This is just asking for a comparison.] I maintained my poker face as best as I could. \\"Chan-ho, shall we start with 'It's a Lie'?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Soon, Han So-ri began to play 'It's a Lie' on the keyboard. * * * \\"As expected, he's good. Chan-ho's specialty is dancing, but he's also charming as a vocalist. Now, let's start the dance.\\" \\"Yes!\\" Kim Chan-ho responded and began the choreography for 'The Perfect Man'. His movements were precise and powerful. [Ah, it's perfect.] Kim Chan-ho's 'The Perfect Man' was truly perfect. My face gradually turned to despair. But it was too early to be disappointed. [There must be a clear difference between Chan-ho and me... Is there really?] I was sinking deeper into the pit of despair. After finishing his performance, Kim Chan-ho, panting heavily, stood in front of Park Jin-soo. \\"Chan-ho, your dance is really good. There's nothing to criticize. You could go on stage right now.\\" \\"Really, Chan-ho is the standard for both vocals and dance. I wish everyone could do as much as Chan-ho.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk PD also didn't skimp on praise. \\"Just keep doing what you're doing, Chan-ho. Got it?\\" \\"Yes, representative.\\" After Kim Chan-ho left, Park Jin-soo and I locked eyes. [Could it be me? Park Jin-soo, why are you doing this? Comparing a 1-year trainee with a 1-month trainee directly?] As if he knew what was on my mind, Park Jin-soo nodded. \\"Sung-guk, shall we see what you've prepared?\\" The trainees murmured. \\"Oh my, they chose the same thing.\\" \\"Wow, the difference in skill will be blatantly obvious.\\" I clenched my fists and stood up. \\"Since you chose the same song as Chan-ho, we'll be able to better assess your skills.\\" [You're telling me to know my place. Park Jin-soo, that's cruel...] \\"Let's start with the song.\\" Soon after, Han So-ri played the keyboard. I entered the intro with as much falsetto as possible. I thought appealing with my voice, which hadn't fully changed yet, would create a clearer distinction from Kim Chan-ho. At the same time, Park Jin-soo and Bang Mu-hyuk stared intently at me. However, their thoughts were unreadable. \\"Sung-guk, the dance is also 'The Perfect Man' like Chan-ho's, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"It's meaningless to compare you with Chan-ho, but let's see how much you've grown in a month.\\" \\"Yes!\\" Finally, the intro to 'The Perfect Man' began to play. I started the choreography comfortably at first. Of course, compared to Kim Chan-ho, my skills were trash. Then, I had to throw a curveball. As 'The Perfect Man' reached its climax, even the tense trainees began clapping and singing along. [Now, let's throw the curveball!] I naturally turned and flung off my hoodie. At that moment, screams from the female trainees erupted. \\"Aaah!\\" \\"Euaah!\\" Simultaneously, Park Jin-soo clapped and laughed so hard he fell backward. * * * \\"Sung-guk, you should work out a bit before stripping. Just taking it off won't do.\\" Park Jin-soo began the evaluation with a face full of laughter. Bang Mu-hyuk was barely holding back his laughter. \\"Sung-guk, I saw your ribs well.\\" \\"But it was a hit with the girls. Bang PD, did you hear the screams?\\" \\"Exactly. Sung-guk, was that a foul play because you thought you couldn't beat Chan-ho, so you stripped?\\" [Oh no, did they see through me...] I scratched my head. \\"Sung-guk, honestly, you're still lacking in everything. Vocals, dance, everything. But it's not ordinary to have improved this much in a month. Plus, being a Harvard student and a model student, I was worried about how you'd be on stage... but you really showed off your charm on stage today. I'm very satisfied with today's performance because it felt like I saw your star quality.\\" \\"Sung-guk, next time, compete fairly without using tricks.\\" [If the results are bad, everything is bad, Bang Mu-hyuk.] I smiled sheepishly and fiddled with my hoodie. \\"Yes. I'll work harder.\\" Then I slumped down in my seat. [Ah, I really burned myself out...] * * * Park Jin-soo, Bang Mu-hyuk, Han So-ri, and Lee Seo-rin gathered to conduct the monthly evaluation. \\"Still, the first place is obviously Chan-ho, right?\\" \\"That's right. Chan-ho is the best in this group in terms of skills.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk agreed. \\"Seo-jin and Yoo-mi are also fine... But what do you all think about Sung-guk?\\" Park Jin-soo asked seriously. \\"What do you mean? What's the point?\\" \\"I was completely charmed by that kid today. Knowing he couldn't beat Chan-ho with skills, he took off his hoodie. How did he come up with that?\\" \\"I screamed along too.\\" Lee Seo-rin joined in. \\"What about you, Han So-ri?\\" \\"Did you see how he deliberately sang in a more falsetto voice? Sung-guk is really smart.

[아직도 우리 엄마, 아빠 골뱅이 좋아하는구나.] 어린 시절 민국이가 지금 자는 방만 한 원룸에서 기어 다닐 때, 아빠는 퇴근길에 유통기한 까딱까딱한 골뱅이 통조림을 집어 들고 와서는 엄마에게 골뱅이 무침을 만들어 줬었다. “엄마, 아직도 골뱅이 좋아해?” “성국아, 엄마가 골뱅이 무침 좋아하는 거 어떻게 알았어?” 아차, 한 살 아기가 그때를 기억한다고 말하면 이상하지. “그랬던 것 같아서….” 나는 대충 얼버무렸다. “우리 성국이는 이런 것도 다 기억하고…. 성국이는 언제 자라서 우리랑 맥주 마시지?” [지금도 가능한데… 엄마, 나 이제 대학생이야.] 아빠가 냉장고에서 콜라를 꺼내줬다. “오늘은 특별히 콜라.” [이걸로 만족하지, 뭐.] 나는 아빠에게 민국이와 맺은 계약서를 내밀었다. “성국아, 이게 뭐야?” “아빠, 나랑 민국이랑 계약했어. 민국이가 이렇게 안 하면 혼내줘.” 아빠가 흐뭇하게 내 계약서를 훑었다. “성국이가 이제는 민국이 교육까지 다 시키네. 민국이 녀석, 계약서까지 썼으니 공부 안 할 수가 없겠네.” “민국이가 요즘 사춘기인가 봐. 맨날 툴툴거리고 말도 참 안 들어.” [엄마, 사춘기, 다 호르몬 때문이야. 그 시기만 지나가면 또 괜찮아.] 나는 아주 짧고 강렬하게 그 시기를 이미 지나쳤다. 아빠가 나를 물끄러미 바라보더니 눈시울이 뜨거워지는 게 보였다. “성국이가 진짜 많이 컸구나….” 아빠는 다 좋은데, 감정이 너무 풍부했다. “자기야, 나 늙은 건 안 보여?” “이뻤던 우리 소영이도 많이 늙었지.” “참, 성국아. 네 말대로 판교는 팔았는데, 아직 마곡이랑 동탄 쪽 땅을 못 찾았어. 매물이 몇 있기는 한데, 찾기가 쉽지가 않네. 이 돈이면 웬만한 땅들은 다 사긴 한다는데… 덥석 사기가 무섭네.” 판교는 평당 20만 원에 사서 400만 원이 넘는 가격에 팔았다. 20배 가까이 수익을 냈다. 3억에 산 땅이 60억이 된 것이다. 역시 땅은 배신을 안 한다. “아빠, 제가 한국에 있는 동안 같이 보러 가요. 그리고… 엄마, 민국이랑 지희 다니는 학원이요. 제가 좀 보고 가도 될까요?” “성국아, 일주일 남았는데 편하게 쉬어.” 엄마는 내가 무리할까 봐 말렸다. [뭔 소리야, 엄마! 비싼 돈 들여서 학원 다니는데 제대로 공부하는지 확인해야지!] “소영아, 성국이가 동생들 공부하는 거 한번 보고 싶나 본데, 그렇게 하자. 성국이가 누구야? 이 나이에 하버드 들어간 녀석이잖아. 동생들 공부 신경 쓰여서 그러는 거야.” [아빠, 그 말이 내 말이야!] 엄마는 약간 나를 못 믿는 눈치였다. “자기야, 성국이가 민국이랑 지희 공부하는 게 눈에 차겠어?” “엄마, 나도 민국이랑 지희가 나만큼 뛰어나지 않다는 것은 충분히 알아.” “이 녀석 보게. 잘난 척을 아주 교묘하게 하네….” 아빠가 내 머리를 손으로 쓰다듬었다. [아빠, 헤어스타일 망가져. 그만.] “근데 성국아, 정말 판교 땅 판 돈을 한꺼번에 투자해도 되겠어? 여기서 몇 억이라도 빼서 너 미국에서 좀 편하게 지내면 어떨까?” “아빠, 난 후원 많이 받아서 괜찮아.” 아빠가 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “이 녀석 누구 닮아서 이렇게 짠돌이인지 모르겠어.” [누구 닮긴. 엄마, 아빠 닮았지.] 집만 넓어졌을 뿐 우리 집 식탁은 원룸에서 투 룸으로 이사 갈 때 투 룸에 살던 사람들이 버리고 간 그 식탁 그대로였다. 엄마와 아빠는 철마다 입을 옷 한두 벌이면 족했고, 신발도 마찬가지였다. “성국아, 돈 필요하면 언제든지 편하게 말해. 엄마랑 아빠가 그 정도는 도와줄 수 있잖아.” “그럴게.” 솔직히 그럴 필요는 전혀 없었다. 효진 그룹의 후원도 있었고, 내 주식만 이래저래 팔아도 됐다. 하지만 이렇게 말하는 게 자식의 도리라고 배웠다. [나 같은 아들 또 없지!] “자, 성국이도 오늘 피곤할 텐데… 마지막 짠 하고 우리도 자자.” “응, 아빠.” “자, 엄마도 같이 짠 하자!” 오랜만에 엄마와 아빠 사이에서 사랑받는 아들인 느낌이었다. [이런 거에 왜 또 울컥하고 그래, 전성국.] 달칵. 문 열리는 소리가 들렸다. 그러곤 또 후다다닥. 그리고 또 후다다닥. 공포의 발걸음 소리다! 곧 지희의 까랑까랑한 목소리가 들려왔다. “엄마, 지희도!” “어, 그래. 지희도 여기 앉자.” 지희가 앉자 연이어 또 문 열리는 소리가 들렸다. “뭐야! 나만 빼고 다들 미워!” “민국아, 너 잤잖아.” 아빠는 얼른 민국이를 달랬다. “아빠, 나도 짠 할래!” “그래, 지희도 짠 하자.” “아빠, 나도. 나도!” “알았어. 민국이는 우유 마시자.” 어느새 엄마는 지희의 요구르트와 민국이의 우유를 냉장고에서 꺼내왔다. “형이랑 오붓하게 짠, 하려고 했더니….” 엄마가 미안한 듯 나를 쳐다봤다. “엄마, 괜찮아.” [물론 안 괜찮지. 이 혹덩이들! 분위기 파괴자들!] 지희가 내 무릎을 손가락으로 톡톡 쳤다. “왜?” “오빠 무릎에 앉을래.” 지희가 팔을 벌리고 기다렸다. 나는 얼른 지희를 안아 무릎에 앉혔다. “오빠!” “왜, 지희야?” “오빠, 난 오빠가 세상에서 제일 좋아.” “진짜?” “응!” 지희가 고개를 까딱했다. [그래, 이 맛에 대한민국 장남 하는 거지.] “자, 지희야. 오빠랑 짠 할까?” “형아, 나두!” [그래, 넌 나랑 노예 계약 맺었으니 끼어주겠어.] “민국이도 짠 하자.” “성국아! 엄마, 아빠도 끼워줘야지.” 엄마와 아빠도 잔을 들었다. 그리고 모두 한목소리로 외쳤다. “짠!” * * * 내 앞에 민국이와 지희가 무릎을 꿇고 앉아 있었다. 나는 민국이의 성적표를 살폈다. 2004년 새해가 밝았고, 민국이도 이제 초등학교 5학년이 된다. 이때만 해도 초등학교에서는 중간고사, 기말고사 등 일반적인 시험을 치렀다. 4학년 민국이의 성적표를 보는 내 미간이 구겨지기 시작했다. “민국아, 너 혹시 시험을 일부러 못 본 거야?” “형, 그게 무슨 말이야? 시험을 어떻게 일부러 못 봐?” 민국이가 동그란 눈을 해맑게 깜빡였다. “민국아, 원래 수우미양가 중에 수나 우가 성적표에 많아야 하는 거 아니야? 어떻게 하면 이렇게 수와 우가 전혀 없는 성적표를 받을 수가 있어?” “아하, 형이 잘 모르나 본데 원래 평균이 좋은 거야. 나, 딱 중간이잖아.” 나는 이를 앙 물었다. “민국아, 초등학교 시험은 그냥 책 한두 번 정도 읽고 가면 다 맞을 수 있는 거 아니야?” “에이, 형. 초등학교 시험 그렇게 쉽지 않아. 엄청 어려워. 형도 보면 다 못 맞을 거야.” [나 초등 검정고시 만점 받은 사람이야, 전민국!] 나는 단전으로부터 올라오는 깊은 한숨을 쉬었다. 이 녀석이 아이큐가 160이 넘다니…. 정말 하늘은 불공평했다. “민국아, 오늘 내가 너 학원 가서 공부하는 거 지켜볼 거야.” “혀, 형이 왜?” 민국이 녀석 놀라는 게 수상했다. “학원에서 어떻게 공부하기에 도대체 이 성적인지 궁금해서. 안 된다는 말은 하지 마. 이미 부모님께 다 허락받은 일이야. 그리고 이번엔 지희.” “네에, 오빠!” “지희야, 너는 오빠가 공부 열심히 하라고 했는데, 기억하지?” “오빠! 지희 영어 학원에서 1등 해요.” “진짜?” “네에!” 역시 지희는 예상대로 공부에 재능이 있었다. [그래, 외모로는 우리 집 유전자 다 비껴갔으니 머리라도 좋아야지.] “지희도 오빠가 오늘 학원 가서 어떻게 공부하는지 지켜볼 거야.” “네에!” “자, 30분 안에 준비해서 학원 가자!” 민국이는 얼굴을 잔뜩 찡그렸다. 싫은 티가 역력했다. “전민국, 형이랑 계약하지 않았어? 우리 회사는 데뷔 때 학교 성적 본다고 했지?” “아, 알았어, 형. 형, 근데 계약은 어제 했으니까 이제부터 성적 보는 거지? 예전 성적은 안 보는 거지?” “그래, 이제부터 볼 거야.” “알았어! 준비할게!” 민국이도 얼른 방으로 달려갔다. 엄마가 걱정스러운 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 민국이 너무 혼내지 마. 그래도 학원은 열심히 가.” “엄마, 걱정 마세요. 둘이 어떻게 공부하는지 지켜보고만 올게요.” 지희가 얼른 영어 학원 가방을 메고 나왔다. “오빠, 지희 준비 다 했어요!” 지희는 똘망똘망한 것이 꼭 나의 어릴 적을 보는 것 같았다. “지희야, 오빠 손.” “응. 손.” 지희가 내 오른손을 잡았다. 민국이도 가방을 메고 헐레벌떡 뛰어왔다. “민국아, 가자.” “으응. 형.” 민국이는 조금 자신 없는 목소리로 대답했다. * * * 민국이와 지희가 다니는 영어 학원은 같은 곳이었다. 레벨별로 수업이 진행되기 때문에 지희 같은 유치원생부터 민국이 또래의 초등학생들까지 연령이 다양했다. 학원 입구에 들어서자 학원 원장의 화려한 이력이 학원 앞에 쭉 붙어 있었다. 중년의 학원 원장은 보스턴 대학교 앞에서 찍은 사진 여러 개를 올려놨다. 그래서 학원 이름도 <보스턴 영어 학원>이었다. [흠… 보스턴 대학을 나오셨나?] 그런데 이상한 게 몇 개 보였다. 학원 앞에 걸어놓은 학교 증명서는 보스턴 대학교 단기 어학연수였다. 그런데 이력에는 분명 보스턴 대학 졸업이라고 적혀 있었다. 이때, 원장이 나오더니 우리 가족을 반겼다. “어머, 지희가 자기 오빠 미국에서 공부하다가 왔다고 하더니, 같이 오셨나 봐요.” “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “와, 민국이도 잘생겨서 여자 친구들한테 인기 많은데, 형은 더 잘생겼네요. 연예인 아니죠?” “원장 선생님, 우리 형 그거 나왔어요. 아기 바구니인가 뭔가요. 가수들이랑 같이 뭐 찍은 거 있어요.” “혹시 <다섯 남자와 아기 바구니>에 나온 그 아기가 민국이 형이었어?” “맞아요!” 민국이는 신이 나서 발을 동동 굴렀다. “어머, 나 그 프로그램 완전 애청자였잖아요. 벌써 이렇게 크다니…. 근데 그게 몇 년 전이었더라…. 그럼, 지금 중학생이에요?” “아니요. 대학생이요. 월반을 좀 많이 해서요.” “미국에서 그럼 대학 다녀요?” “네.” “어디요?” “하버드요.” 그 순간, 원장 선생님의 얼굴이 굳는 게 보였다. [원장, 왜, 뭐가 찔려?] 원장은 애써 웃으며 민국이랑 지희를 얼른 학원 안으로 들여보냈다. “민국아, 지희야. 수업 늦겠다. 어서 들어가.” “네!” “녜에!” 나도 민국이와 지희를 따라가려고 하자, 원장이 내 앞을 딱 가로막았다. “민국이 형은 나랑 원장실에서 커피 한 잔 마실래요?” “죄송한데요, 원장 선생님. 전 민국이랑 지희 공부 어떻게 하는지 보고 싶어서 왔어요. 수업 좀 봐도 될까요?” “그게… 선생님들이 워낙 예민하셔서요.” [분명 뭐가 찔리는군.] 내가 학원 안으로 한 발 밀어 넣자, 원장도 따라 움직였다. “민국이 형, 나랑 커피 한 잔 해요. 내가 원장실에서 민국이랑 지희의 수업 태도와 실력에 대해서 자세히 알려줄게요.” “원장 선생님, 제가 수업을 좀 보면 안 될까요? 제 동생들이 어느 정도 실력인지 제 눈으로 직접 확인하고 싶어서요.” 내 말에 원장 선생님은 더듬더듬 할 말을 찾는 게 보였다. 왜냐하면 내가 영어로 물어봤기 때문이다. 원장 선생님은 몇 번 애매하게 웃더니 내 팔을 딱 잡았다. “잠시만요. 민국이 가르치는 선생님인데, 미국에서 좋은 학교 나오신 분이에요. 두 분 말이 잘 통할 것 같네요. 오실 때가 됐어요.” 마침 문을 열고 낯익은 남자가 한 명 들어왔다. “올리버 선생님, 여기 민국이 형인데요. 잠시 이야기 좀 할 수 있을까요?” 나는 올리버를 한눈에 알아봤다. 바로 나의 유일한 초등학교 친구인 최정우의 집에서 영어 과외를 하던 그 올리버였다. 올리버는 원장 선생님의 말과 달리 미국에서 대학도 다니다 말았다. 소위 말하는 좋은 대학도 아니었다. 올리버는 웃으며 내게 손을 내밀었다. “안녕하세요, 전 올리버예요.” [오랜만이야, 올리버!] 나는 올리버의 손을 꽉 잡았다.","completion":"Episode 120 Minguk peeked into the room. Minguk was sound asleep, unaware that he had signed a slave contract with me. I gently closed the door and went to my mom and dad. Mom and Dad were having a beer just like old times. Even the side dish was whelk. [So, Mom and Dad still like whelk.] When Minguk was crawling around in a studio apartment the size of his current room during his childhood, Dad would bring home cans of whelk that were close to their expiration date and ask Mom to make whelk salad. \\"Mom, do you still like whelk?\\" \\"Sungkook, how did you know Mom likes whelk salad?\\" Oops, it would be weird to say a one-year-old remembers that time. \\"It seemed like it….\\" I mumbled vaguely. \\"Our Sungkook remembers all this…. When will Sungkook grow up and drink beer with us?\\" [I could do it now… Mom, I'm a college student now.] Dad handed me a cola from the fridge. \\"Today, you get a special cola.\\" [I'll be satisfied with this, I guess.] I handed Dad the contract I had made with Minguk. \\"Sungkook, what's this?\\" \\"Dad, I made a contract with Minguk. If he doesn't do this, he'll be in trouble.\\" Dad looked over my contract with a pleased expression. \\"Sungkook is now even teaching Minguk. With a contract written, Minguk has no choice but to study.\\" \\"Minguk seems to be going through puberty these days. He's always grumbling and doesn't listen.\\" [Mom, it's all hormones during puberty. It'll be fine once it passes.] I had already gone through that phase very briefly and intensely. Dad looked at me with teary eyes. \\"Sungkook has really grown up….\\" Dad was great, but his emotions were too rich. \\"Honey, don't you see I'm getting old?\\" \\"Our beautiful Soyoung has aged a lot too.\\" \\"By the way, Sungkook. As you said, we sold the Pangyo land, but we haven't found the land in Magok and Dongtan yet. There are a few listings, but it's not easy to find. With this money, we could buy almost any land… but I'm scared to jump in.\\" We bought the Pangyo land for 200,000 won per pyeong and sold it for over 4 million won per pyeong. We made almost 20 times the profit. A land bought for 300 million won became 60 billion won. Land never betrays indeed. \\"Dad, let's go see it together while I'm in Korea. And… Mom, about the academy Minguk and Jihee are attending. Can I check it out before I go?\\" \\"Sungkook, you have a week left, just rest comfortably.\\" [Mom, what are you talking about! We're paying a lot for the academy, we have to check if they're studying properly!] \\"Soyoung, Sungkook wants to see how his siblings study, let's do that. Who is Sungkook? He got into Harvard at this age. He's worried about his siblings' studies.\\" [Dad, that's exactly what I'm saying!] Mom seemed a bit distrustful of me. \\"Honey, do you think Minguk and Jihee's studies will catch your eye?\\" \\"Mom, I'm well aware that Minguk and Jihee aren't as exceptional as me.\\" \\"Look at this kid. He's so cleverly arrogant….\\" Dad ruffled my hair. [Dad, you're ruining my hairstyle. Stop.] \\"But Sungkook, are you really okay with investing all the money from selling the Pangyo land at once? Wouldn't it be better to take out a few billion won for you to live more comfortably in the US?\\" \\"Dad, I'm fine because I receive a lot of sponsorships.\\" Dad shook his head. \\"I don't know who this kid takes after to be such a penny-pincher.\\" [Who else but Mom and Dad.] Our dining table was the same one left behind by the previous tenants when we moved from a studio to a two-room apartment. Mom and Dad were content with just a couple of outfits per season and the same went for shoes. \\"Sungkook, if you need money, feel free to tell us. Mom and Dad can at least help with that.\\" \\"I will.\\" Honestly, there was no need. I had the sponsorship from Hyojin Group, and I could just sell some of my stocks. But I learned that saying this was a child's duty. [There's no son like me!] \\"Alright, Sungkook must be tired too… Let's all go to bed after one last cheers.\\" \\"Okay, Dad.\\" \\"Mom, let's cheers together!\\" It felt like being a beloved son between Mom and Dad after a long time. [Why am I getting emotional over this, Jeon Sungkook.] Click. The sound of the door opening was heard. Then, the sound of hurried footsteps. And again, the sound of hurried footsteps. The sound of terror! Soon, Jihee's clear voice was heard. \\"Mom, Jihee too!\\" \\"Oh, okay. Jihee, come sit here.\\" As Jihee sat down, the sound of the door opening was heard again. \\"What! Everyone's here without me!\\" \\"Minguk, you were asleep.\\" Dad quickly comforted Minguk. \\"Dad, I want to cheers too!\\" \\"Okay, let's cheers with Jihee.\\" \\"Dad, me too. Me too!\\" \\"Alright. Minguk, let's drink milk.\\" Soon, Mom brought out Jihee's yogurt and Minguk's milk from the fridge. \\"I was hoping to have a quiet cheers with my brother….\\" Mom looked at me apologetically. \\"Mom, it's okay.\\" [Of course, it's not okay. These mood breakers!] Jihee tapped my knee with her finger. \\"Why?\\" \\"I want to sit on my brother's lap.\\" Jihee waited with her arms open. I quickly picked up Jihee and sat her on my lap. \\"Brother!\\" \\"Why, Jihee?\\" \\"Brother, I like you the most in the world.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Jihee nodded her head. [Yeah, this is why I'm the eldest son of the Republic of Korea.] \\"Jihee, shall we cheers with your brother?\\" \\"Brother, me too!\\" [Alright, you've signed a slave contract with me, so I'll include you.] \\"Let's cheers with Minguk too.\\" \\"Sungkook! Mom and Dad should join too.\\" Mom and Dad also raised their glasses. And everyone shouted in unison. \\"Cheers!\\" * * * Minguk and Jihee were kneeling in front of me. I was looking at Minguk's report card. The year 2004 had dawned, and Minguk was now entering the 5th grade of elementary school. At that time, elementary schools still had midterms and finals like regular exams. My brow furrowed as I looked at Minguk's 4th-grade report card. \\"Minguk, did you deliberately do poorly on the exams?\\" \\"Brother, what do you mean? How can someone deliberately do poorly on exams?\\" Minguk blinked his round eyes innocently. \\"Minguk, aren't you supposed to have mostly 'S' and 'A' grades on your report card? How did you manage to get a report card without any 'S' or 'A' grades?\\" \\"Ah, brother, you might not know, but having an average is actually good. I'm exactly in the middle.\\" I clenched my teeth. \\"Minguk, aren't elementary school exams something you can ace just by reading the book once or twice?\\" \\"Eh, brother. Elementary school exams aren't that easy. They're super hard. Even you wouldn't be able to get everything right.\\" [I aced the elementary school equivalency exam, Jeon Minguk!] I sighed deeply from my core. This kid has an IQ over 160…. The heavens are truly unfair. \\"Minguk, I'm going to watch how you study at the academy today.\\" \\"Wh-why, brother?\\" Minguk's surprised reaction was suspicious. \\"Because I'm curious how you study at the academy to get these grades. Don't say no. I've already got permission from our parents. And this time, Jihee.\\" \\"Yes, brother!\\" \\"Jihee, remember when your brother told you to study hard?\\" \\"Brother! Jihee got 1st place in the English academy.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes!\\" As expected, Jihee had a talent for studying. [Well, since you've dodged our family's looks, you should at least be smart.] \\"Jihee, your brother will also watch how you study at the academy today.\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Let's get ready and go to the academy in 30 minutes!\\" Minguk grimaced, clearly unhappy. \\"Jeon Minguk, didn't you sign a contract with your brother? Our company checks school grades when debuting.\\" \\"Ah, okay, brother. But we signed the contract yesterday, so you'll start checking from now on, right? You won't look at past grades, right?\\" \\"Right, from now on.\\" \\"Okay! I'll get ready!\\" Minguk hurried off to his room. Mom looked at me worriedly. \\"Sungkook, don't be too hard on Minguk. He does go to the academy diligently.\\" \\"Mom, don't worry. I'll just watch how they study and come back.\\" Jihee quickly came out with her English academy bag. \\"Brother, Jihee is ready!\\" Jihee looked so bright and eager, just like I used to be. \\"Jihee, hold your brother's hand.\\" \\"Okay. Hand.\\" Jihee grabbed my right hand. Minguk also rushed out with his bag. \\"Minguk, let's go.\\" \\"Uh-huh. Brother.\\" Minguk responded with a slightly uncertain voice. * * * Minguk and Jihee attended the same English academy. The academy had classes divided by levels, so there were students of various ages, from kindergarteners like Jihee to elementary students like Minguk. As we entered the academy, the principal's impressive resume was displayed at the entrance. The middle-aged principal had several photos of himself in front of Boston University. Hence, the academy was named <Boston English Academy>. [Hmm… Did he graduate from Boston University?] But something seemed off. The diploma displayed at the academy entrance was for a short-term language course at Boston University. However, the resume clearly stated he graduated from Boston University. Then, the principal came out and greeted our family. \\"Oh, Jihee said her brother came back from studying in the U.S., and here you are.\\" \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Wow, Minguk is popular with the girls because he's handsome, but his brother is even more handsome. Are you a celebrity?\\" \\"Principal, my brother was in that show. What was it? Something about a baby basket. He filmed something with singers.\\" \\"Are you the baby from <Five Men and a Baby Basket>?\\" \\"That's right!\\" Minguk was excitedly hopping around. \\"Oh my, I was a huge fan of that show. To think you've grown up so much…. But when was that… So, are you in middle school now?\\" \\"No, I'm a college student. I skipped a few grades.\\" \\"You're attending college in the U.S.?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Where?\\" \\"Harvard.\\" At that moment, the principal's face stiffened. [Principal, why, feeling guilty?] The principal, trying to smile, quickly ushered Minguk and Jihee into the academy. \\"Minguk, Jihee, you'll be late for class. Go on in.\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Yees!\\" As I tried to follow Minguk and Jihee, the principal blocked my way. \\"Would Minguk's brother like to have a cup of coffee with me in the principal's office?\\" \\"Sorry, Principal. I came to see how Minguk and Jihee study. Could I observe the class?\\" \\"That's… The teachers are quite sensitive.\\" [Definitely something fishy.] As I pushed my way into the academy, the principal moved as well. \\"Minguk's brother, how about a cup of coffee with me? I'll tell you in detail about Minguk and Jihee's class behavior and skills in my office.\\" \\"Principal, could I just observe the class? I want to see for myself how skilled my siblings are.\\" The principal stumbled over his words in response to my question in English. The principal awkwardly smiled a few times before grabbing my arm. \\"Just a moment. Minguk's teacher is from the U.S., a graduate of a prestigious university. I think you two will have a lot to talk about. He should be arriving soon.\\" Just then, a familiar man entered through the door. \\"Oliver, this is Minguk's brother. Could you talk to him for a moment?\\" I recognized Oliver immediately. He was the only friend from my elementary school days, Choi Jungwoo's house, where he tutored English. Contrary to the principal's words, Oliver had dropped out of college in the U.S. It wasn't even a prestigious university. Oliver smiled and extended his hand to me. \\"Hello, I'm Oliver.\\" [Long time no see, Oliver!] I firmly shook Oliver's hand."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[뭐야? 나 떨어질 것 같으니까, 속내를 털어놓는 건가.] 김찬호는 생수를 벌컥벌컥 마시더니 조심스레 물었다. “성국아, 그런 행동은 어떻게 하는 거야? 아이디어가 떠오르는 거야?” 지금 김찬호는 진심으로 나에게 조언을 구하고 있었다. 김찬호는 평가에서 받듯이 정석적인 보컬과 댄스 무대를 보여준다. 물론 훌륭한 외모와 실력으로 무대를 장악하지만, 나같이 돌발 행동을 하는 멤버들과 있다면 묻힐 게 뻔히 보였다. 김찬호도 그게 고민인 모양이었다. “형… 저는 공부할 때도 그렇고, 이번 평가 받을 때도 그렇고, 이런 생각만 해요.” “무슨 생각?” “오늘이 내가 사는 마지막 날이다. 오늘이 내가 사는 마지막 날이라고 하면 못 할 게 없잖아요. 내일은 없는데, 어때요. 누가 날 보고 욕할 것도 아니고요. 그리고 솔직히 전 오늘 진짜 JP에서의 마지막이 될지도 모르고요.” “성국아, 너는 꼭 붙을 것 같아.” 김찬호가 위로를 해줬다. 달칵. 연습실 문이 열리더니 곧 박진수와 방무혁이 들어왔다. “오늘 정말 다들 고생 많았어. 자세한 코멘트는 레슨 때 선생님들이 해주실 거고, 오늘 1등은 당연히 찬호.” 여기저기서 박수 소리가 들렸다. 김찬호도 허리를 숙여 인사를 했다. “그리고 오늘 탈락자는 딱 한 명이야.” 모두들 손을 꼭 잡고 긴장한 채 서로를 바라봤다. 다들 나만 아니었으면 좋겠다는 얼굴이었다. “오늘 탈락자는… 바로 전성국.” 발표와 동시에 모두 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “말도 안 돼.” 하는 소리가 여기저기서 들렸다. “성국아, 그동안 고생 많았어. 자, 다른 연습생들은 모두 내일 레슨 나오고, 성국이는 사무실로 좀 와.” “네.” 연습실 문이 스르륵 닫혔다. 김찬호가 믿을 수 없단 눈으로 나를 봤다. “성국아, 네가 떨어지다니 말도 안 돼.” “형, 저 괜찮아요.” “진짜?” “네.” 나는 결과를 담담히 받아들였다. * * * 괜찮을 리가 있나. 나는 화장실 변기에 앉아서 겨우 눈물을 참고 있다. 눈시울이 붉어져서 나가질 못하고 있었다. 사춘기 호르몬 때문인지, 한없이 유치해지기도 했다. [박진수, 저주할 거야. 방무혁, 내가 대한민국의 K-POP을 이끌어 나갈 때 같이 하려고 했는데, 진짜 이러기야!] 자존심이 구겨질 대로 구겨졌다. 인생 최초의 낙오였다. 한 달이었지만, 정말 인생을 걸고 열심히 했다. 그런데 결과는 처참했다. 벌써부터 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 결과를 올릴 생각을 하니 머리가 멍했다. 보나 마나 응원부터 시작해서 그럴 줄 알았다는 조롱도 달릴 게 뻔했다. 띠링. 방무혁의 메시지였다. - 성국아, 왜 이렇게 안 와? 어디야? - 곧 갈게요. 히잉. 나는 코를 힘차게 풀었다. * * * 사무실의 문고 들어가자 박진수와 방무혁은 탈락한 나의 기분과 상관없이 화기애애했다. “성국아, 어서 와.” [박진수, 나 떨어뜨려 놓고 완전 웃고 있네.] 나는 인사를 하며 안으로 들어갔다. “성국아, 너 울었어?” 방무혁이 나를 잠시 살폈다. “아, 아니에요.” “성국이, 승부욕이 대단하구나. 하긴, 그러니까 그 나이에 하버드도 다니지. 성국아, 내가 왜 너 떨어뜨렸는지 알아?” [너무 잘나서?] 나는 입을 앙다물었다. 그러곤 고개를 저었다. 일단 모르는 척을 했다. “성국아, 너 인생에서 실패해본 적 있어?” [박진수, 나 완전 흙수저 출신이야. 돌 때부터 인생의 쓴맛 제대로 보며 컸다고.] 나는 눈을 동그랗게 뜨고 박진수를 쳐다봤다. “그게 무슨 말씀이세요?” “솔직히 난 이번 무대 너무 마음에 들었어. 한 달 동안 기본기조차 없던 네가 이 무대를 완성한 거 보고 정말 감탄했거든. 거기다 같은 노래를 선곡한 찬호를 이겨 보겠다고 아이디어까지 낸 거 보고는 정말 이 녀석은 된다, 이 생각 했어.” [근데 왜 떨어뜨린 거야, 박진수?] 박진수가 턱을 매만졌다. “그런데… 무혁이도 같은 생각인데. 넌 혼자 너무 빛이 나.” “네에?” “JP에서는 그룹을 만들잖아. 예전에 네가 나한테 그런 말 한 적 있잖아. 잘하는 친구들도 중요하지만, 같이 묻어가는 멤버도 중요하다고. 근데 너는 너무 튀어. 너 자체로.” [그게 뭐가 잘못된 거야?] 나는 당최 이유를 알 수 없었다. “성국아.” 방무혁이 따뜻한 목소리로 나를 불렀다. “네, 피디님.” “나는 그것보다, 너 진짜 아이돌이 하고 싶어? 아니면 그냥 뭐든 열심히 해본 거야?” 방무혁은 진지했다. 얼굴에 웃음기 하나 없었다. [솔직히라….] 물론 난 아이돌은 꿈에도 생각 없었다. 어린 시절 아역 모델 해서 사람들에게 얼굴 팔리고 돈 벌어봐서 이 세계가 어떤지 너무 잘 알았다. 사람들은 인기 있을 때는 벌 떼처럼 모여들어서 물고 빨지만, 인기가 식으면 바로 다른 타깃으로 옮겨갔다. 인기 있을 때에도 모르는 사람들에게 사랑과 공격을 동시에 받았다. 이제 곧 인터넷으로 모든 것을 홍보하고, 연예인들도 각자의 SNS로 홍보하는 시대가 온다. 카메라 달린 핸드폰으로 길거리에서 돌아다니다가도 찍히고, 학교생활 중 사소한 실수도 누군가에 의해서 부풀려져 공개되기도 한다. 나는 그런 삶을 살 생각이 없었다. 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “피디님 말이 맞는 거 같아요. 저는 아이돌이 되는 것보다는 그냥 뭐든지 한번 열심히 해보고 싶었던 것 같아요. 제 한계를 알고 싶어서요.” 방무혁이 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “박진수 대표는 너의 가능성을 정말 높게 사. 너무 혼자 튀지만, 그것만으로도 활력소가 되는 멤버가 될 거라고 여겨. 나도 네 가능성은 정말 탐이 나. 근데 성국아… 제일 중요한 건 네 인생이잖아. 네가 진짜 하고 싶은 일을 해야지.” “아, 난 더 못 참겠다. 성국아, 그냥 나랑 아이돌 하자. 너 딱 6개월만 연습하면 무대 설 수 있어. 하버드 좀 쉬면 어때? 창업 좀 미루면 어때? 어? 이렇게 젊고 잘생겼을 때 대중의 사랑을 받아보는 거야.” 박진수는 답답한지 자리에서 일어나 이리저리 오갔다. “무혁아, 성국이 같은 애가 아이돌 안 하면 누가 하냐.” “성국이도 자기 인생이 있는 거잖아.” 박진수와 방무혁이 동시에 나를 쳐다봤다. “저… 두 분이요, 지금 말한 거 찍어서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올려도 돼요?” “어?” 황당한 얼굴로 박진수와 방무혁이 나를 쳐다봤다. 그 순간 난 깨달았다. 나에게 더 중요한 것은 ‘페이스 페이퍼’라는 사실을. “푸하하하.” 박진수가 뒤로 넘어갈 듯 웃었다. “무혁아, 이 녀석 그냥 사업가네. 사람들이 뭘 좋아하는지 아주 기가 막히게 알아. 성국아, 너 떨어지는 것으로 결론 나면 심심하니까, 이런 뒷얘기 올리려는 거지?” 박진수와 나는 비슷한 면이 있었다. “아무래도 탈락이 엔딩이면 좀 힘이 없잖아요. 이런 뒷이야기가 오갔고, 나는 다시 하버드로 돌아간다. 이런 엔딩이 더 나을 것 같아서요.” “성국이 이 녀석, 정말 못 말리겠어.” 방무혁도 혀를 내둘렀다. 박진수가 얼른 손짓을 했다. “성국아, 어서 찍어. 그리고 나 기가 막힌 엔딩 생각했거든. 그것도 같이 찍어서 올려.” “네!” 나는 미리 준비해간 디지털카메라를 꺼내서 평가 상황을 찍기 시작했다. 박진수와 방무혁은 간단하게 나에 대한 평가를 다시 했고, 박진수는 카메라를 보면서 마지막으로 이런 멘트를 날렸다. “성국아, JP의 문은 너한테만은 활짝 열려 있어. 공부하다가 생각 바뀌면 다시 꼭 돌아와. 성국이라면 난 언제나 환영이니까. JP! PEACE!” * * * - 전성국의 30일 동안 JP 연습생에서 데뷔조 되기 프로젝트 마지막 날. 드디어 결과가 나왔습니다! (쿠키 영상도 있음) 끝까지 봐주세요! 예상대로 내가 후드 티를 벗어 던지는 장면은 인기 폭발이었다. 물론 근육 하나 없는 스키니한 몸매였지만, 여학생들의 댓글은 터져 나가더니 결국 서버가 터지고 말았다. “어쩔 수 없네.” 똑. 똑. 똑. 이제 노크 소리만 들어도 누군지 알 것 같았다. “전민국, 들어와.” “형, 왜 결과를 보고 안 해?” [이 녀석, 끈기만큼은 대단하네.] “형이 지금 목이 정말 많이 마르거든.” “그래서?” [어쭈, 이제 반항하네.] 나는 무심히 등을 돌렸다. “형이 내일 약속 잡아놨는데, JP에는 혼자 놀러 가야겠네….” “아이, 형! 그걸 지금 말하면 어떡해. 물 금방 가져올게!” 후다다닥. 민국이가 뛰어가는 소리가 들렸다. 띠링. 메시지가 도착했다. 마크였다. - 성국, 나 너 다 그만두고 아이돌 되는 줄 알고 깜짝 놀랐잖아. 근데 너 서버 다운시키면 어떡해. 미국 가자마자 일해야 하잖아! - 마크, 곧 만나. 나는 미소를 지으며 기지개를 쭉 켰다. “형님, 여기 물 대령입니다.” 민국이는 어느새 쟁반에 물을 가져왔다. “그래, 동생아.” 나는 물을 벌컥벌컥 마셨다. 띠링. 띠링. 메시지가 또 도착했다. 누구지? 예진이었다. - 성국아, 나 예진이야. 오늘 무대 정말 잘하더라. 근데 정말 탈락한 거야? 미국 언제 가? 그 전에 밥이나 한번 먹자. 답은 하지 않았다. 내 짧은 사춘기는 끝났기 때문이다. [나 원래 엄청 차가운 남자라고.] * * * 민국이에게 JP 엔터테인먼트를 구경시켜 주고 집에 돌아오자마자, 민국이는 방무혁에게 받은 CD며 연습생들과 찍은 사진을 엄마, 아빠에게 자랑하기 바빴다. 엄마는 그 모습을 보더니 한숨을 푹 쉬었다. “성국아, 민국이 안 그래도 공부 안 하는데… 연습생 하겠다고 공부는 뒷전이면 어떡하니.” “민국이 저 녀석, 정말 지 형 반만이라도 따라가지.” 정말 대한민국 장남으로 살기는 힘들었다. 나는 전민국을 데리고 방으로 들어갔다. 민국이는 마냥 신난 얼굴로 나를 올려다봤다. “형, 나도 다음 달에 JP에 연습생 오디션 볼래. 형, 나 될까? 내가 형 춤도 가르쳐 줬잖아.” [흠, 애매하게 계약으로 엮이면 곤란한데….] 민국이는 흥에 겨워서 춤을 추며 방 안을 돌아다녔다. 민국이는 확실히 공부보다는 춤과 노래에 재능이 있었다. 잠시 민국이를 본 방무혁은 민국이도 관심 있으면 오디션 보라고 조언까지 해줬다. “전민국.” “응, 형아.” “나랑 계약하자.” “어? 형이랑 무슨 계약을 해?” “민국아, 만약에 형이 2년 후쯤 한국에 돌아와서 아이돌 그룹을 키운다고 생각해봐. 그럼, 넌 JP에 있을 거야? 형이 하는 회사에 있을 거야?” 고민하는 기색이 역력했다. 요즘은 아이들도 JP나 SG 기획사를 통해 데뷔하면 데뷔와 동시에 스타가 된다는 것쯤은 잘 알고 있었다. 나는 조금 약을 팔았다. “하버드 다니는 형도 JP 연습생에서 떨어졌는데, 네가 될까?” “그, 그거야, 형은 춤을 못 추니까.” “너 정도 춤추는 사람은 많아. 그리고 형 나중에는 춤도 잘 췄어. 성국아, JP 같은 큰 소속사에 가서 용의 꼬리가 될래? 아니면 형이 만든 신생 기획사에 가서 뱀의 머리가 될래?” 잠시 고민하던 민국이가 결심한 듯 나를 봤다. “당연히 형네 회사에서 머리 할래.” “그렇지. 그럼 오늘 형이랑 계약서 쓰자. 형이 기획사 차리면 네가 1호 연습생이야.” “진짜?” “당연하지.” 나는 얼른 컴퓨터로 작성한 계약서를 민국이에게 내밀었다. 순간 민국이의 얼굴이 구겨졌다. “형아, 근데 계약 전에 할 일이 왜 이렇게 많아?” “요즘 데뷔하는 가수들 보면 다들 영어 잘하잖아.” “근데 산수는 왜 공부해야 해?” “우리 기획사는 데뷔조 편성할 때 성적도 볼 거거든. 민국아, 자! 어서 사인해.” 민국이는 긴가민가한 표정으로 계약서에 사인을 했다. 드디어 내 1호 연습생 발탁. 나는 계약서를 보며 빙긋이 미소를 지었다. [전민국, 계약서에 사인하는 게 얼마나 중요한지 모르지? 넌 이제 나랑 노예 계약 한 거야.]","completion":"Episode 119 All the trainees sat in a row, anxiously waiting for the results. Everyone was quiet, having poured all their energy into the stage. At that moment, Kim Chan-ho approached and offered a drink. \\"Sung-guk, have this.\\" What's this? I didn't recall having any conversation with Kim Chan-ho beyond greetings. \\"Thank you.\\" Kim Chan-ho naturally sat down next to me. \\"Sung-guk, you were really cool today.\\" \\"Because of my ribcage showing?\\" \\"You can always bulk up.\\" Kim Chan-ho was a second-year high school student. He was considered old among the trainees. If he couldn't make it into the debut group within 1 or 2 years, he would face a failed life in his twenties. \\"You're perfect in everything, though.\\" \\"Anyone can reach my level with practice. Everyone says I have the skills, but that's it. I lack star quality.\\" Kim Chan-ho, usually reticent, opened up about his feelings. [What? Is he opening up because he thinks I'll be eliminated?] Kim Chan-ho gulped down his water and cautiously asked. \\"Sung-guk, how do you do those actions? Do ideas just come to you?\\" Right now, Kim Chan-ho was sincerely seeking advice from me. Kim Chan-ho, as evaluated, showed standard vocal and dance performances. Of course, he dominated the stage with his excellent looks and skills, but it was clear he would be overshadowed if there were members who performed unexpected actions like me. It seemed Kim Chan-ho was worried about this too. \\"Bro... Whether I'm studying or being evaluated, I only think this.\\" \\"What do you think?\\" \\"Today is the last day of my life. If today were my last day, there's nothing I couldn't do. There's no tomorrow, so what? No one's going to criticize me. And honestly, today might really be my last at JP.\\" \\"Sung-guk, I think you'll definitely make it.\\" Kim Chan-ho offered some comfort. Click. The practice room door opened, and soon Park Jin-su and Bang Mu-hyuk entered. \\"Everyone worked really hard today. The teachers will give detailed comments during the lesson, and today's number one is, of course, Chan-ho.\\" Applause erupted from various places. Kim Chan-ho also bowed in gratitude. \\"And today, there's only one person being eliminated.\\" Everyone tightly held hands, nervously looking at each other. Everyone's face screamed, \\"I hope it's not me.\\" \\"Today's eliminated person is... Jeon Sung-guk.\\" As soon as the announcement was made, everyone looked at me in shock. \\"This can't be happening.\\" murmurs were heard from everywhere. \\"Sung-guk, you've worked hard. Now, everyone else, come to the lesson tomorrow, and Sung-guk, please come to the office.\\" \\"Yes.\\" The practice room door slid shut. Kim Chan-ho looked at me with disbelief. \\"Sung-guk, it doesn't make sense for you to be eliminated.\\" \\"Bro, I'm okay.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I accepted the result calmly. * * * How could I be okay? I was sitting on the toilet in the bathroom, barely holding back tears. My eyes were so red I couldn't leave. Whether it was because of teenage hormones or just being infinitely childish. [Park Jin-su, I'll curse you. Bang Mu-hyuk, I wanted to lead K-POP in Korea with you, really!] My pride was crushed. It was my first failure in life. Though it was only a month, I had worked really hard as if my life depended on it. But the result was devastating. Just thinking about posting the result on 'Face Paper' made my head go blank. From support to mockery, I knew the comments would flood in. Ding. A message from Bang Mu-hyuk. - Sung-guk, why aren't you coming? Where are you? - I'll be there soon. Sigh. I forcefully blew my nose. * * * Entering the office, Park Jin-su and Bang Mu-hyuk were in high spirits, regardless of my feelings. \\"Sung-guk, come in.\\" [Park Jin-su, you're laughing after eliminating me.] I greeted them and entered. \\"Sung-guk, did you cry?\\" Bang Mu-hyuk briefly examined me. \\"No, I didn't.\\" \\"Sung-guk, you have a strong desire to win. Well, that's why you're attending Harvard at your age. Sung-guk, do you know why I eliminated you?\\" [Because I'm too good?] I clenched my mouth shut. Then I shook my head, pretending not to know. \\"Sung-guk, have you ever failed in your life?\\" [Park Jin-su, I'm from a dirt-poor background. I've tasted the bitterness of life since I was a baby.] I looked at Park Jin-su with wide eyes. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Honestly, I really liked this stage. Seeing you, who had no basics a month ago, complete this stage, I was truly amazed. And when you chose the same song as Chan-ho, trying to beat him with your ideas, I really thought, this guy can make it.\\" [Then why did you eliminate me, Park Jin-su?] Park Jin-su stroked his chin. \\"But... Mu-hyuk and I think the same. You shine too much on your own.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"JP forms groups. You once told me, it's important to have talented friends, but it's also important to have members who blend in. But you stand out too much. By yourself.\\" [What's wrong with that?] I couldn't understand the reason. \\"Sung-guk.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk called me with a warm voice. \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" \\"I'm more curious, do you really want to be an idol? Or did you just want to try your best at something?\\" Bang Mu-hyuk was serious. There was not a trace of a smile on his face. [To be honest...] Of course, I had never dreamed of being an idol. Having been a child model and earning money by being recognized by people, I knew too well what this world was like. People swarm like bees when you're popular, but as soon as the popularity fades, they move on to the next target. Even when popular, I received love and attacks from strangers. Soon, an era will come where everything is promoted on the internet, and celebrities promote themselves through their own SNS. Walking down the street with a camera-equipped phone, even minor mistakes made during school life could be exaggerated and exposed by someone. I had no intention of living such a life. I nodded. \\"PD-nim, I think you're right. I wanted to try my best at anything just to know my limits.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk patted my shoulder. \\"Park Jin-su highly values your potential. You stand out too much on your own, but that alone makes you a source of energy for the team. I'm really tempted by your potential. But Sung-guk... The most important thing is your life. You should do what you really want.\\" \\"Ah, I can't stand it anymore. Sung-guk, just be an idol with me. You can stand on stage after just 6 months of practice. What's wrong with taking a break from Harvard? What's wrong with delaying your startup? Huh? It's about receiving the public's love while you're young and handsome.\\" Park Jin-su, frustrated, got up and paced back and forth. \\"Mu-hyuk, if not someone like Sung-guk, then who would be an idol?\\" \\"Sung-guk has his own life too.\\" Park Jin-su and Bang Mu-hyuk looked at me simultaneously. \\"Um... Can I record what you two just said and post it on 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Huh?\\" Park Jin-su and Bang Mu-hyuk looked at me in disbelief. At that moment, I realized. What was more important to me was the fact of 'Face Paper.' \\"Puhahaha.\\" Park Jin-su laughed as if he was going to fall backward. \\"Mu-hyuk, this guy is just a businessman. He knows exactly what people like. Sung-guk, you're making it an ending because it would be boring if it just ended with you being eliminated, right?\\" Park Jin-su and I had something in common. \\"If the elimination is the ending, it's a bit weak, isn't it? It would be better to have this backstory, and then I return to Harvard. That's why I thought this ending would be better.\\" \\"This guy, Sung-guk, is really something.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk also clicked his tongue. Park Jin-su quickly gestured. \\"Sung-guk, hurry up and shoot. And I thought of a fantastic ending. Shoot that and post it too.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I took out the digital camera I had prepared in advance and started shooting the evaluation situation. Park Jin-su and Bang Mu-hyuk briefly re-evaluated me, and Park Jin-su looked at the camera and delivered his final comment. \\"Sung-guk, the door of JP is always wide open for you. If you change your mind while studying, come back. I'll always welcome you, Sung-guk. JP! PEACE!\\" * * * - The last day of Jeon Sung-guk's 30-day project to become a debutant from a JP trainee. The result is finally out! (There's a cookie video too) Please watch till the end! As expected, the scene of me throwing off my hoodie exploded in popularity. Although I had a skinny body without a single muscle, the comments from female students burst forth, eventually crashing the server. \\"Can't be helped.\\" Knock. Knock. Knock. I could almost tell who it was just by the sound of the knock. \\"Jeon Min-guk, come in.\\" \\"Bro, why didn't you report the result?\\" [This guy, his persistence is something.] \\"Bro, I'm really thirsty right now.\\" \\"So?\\" [Oh, now he's being defiant.] I turned my back indifferently. \\"Bro, I made an appointment for tomorrow, but I guess I'll have to go to JP alone...\\" \\"Ah, bro! Why say that now? I'll bring water right away!\\" Thud thud thud. I could hear Min-guk running. Ding. A message arrived. It was Mark. - Sung-guk, I thought you were quitting everything to become an idol. But how could you crash the server? You have to work as soon as you get to the US! - Mark, see you soon. I smiled and stretched. \\"Bro, here's your water.\\" Min-guk had already brought a tray of water. \\"Thanks, little bro.\\" I gulped down the water. Ding. Ding. Another message arrived. Who could it be? It was Ye-jin. - Sung-guk, it's Ye-jin. You did really well on stage today. But are you really eliminated? When are you going to the US? Let's have a meal before you go. I didn't reply. Because my short teenage life had ended. [I was always a very cold guy.] * * * After showing Min-guk around JP Entertainment and returning home, Min-guk couldn't wait to show off the CD and photos he took with the trainees to mom and dad. Mom sighed deeply upon seeing this. \\"Sung-guk, Min-guk is already not studying enough... What if he says he wants to be a trainee and puts studies on the back burner?\\" \\"Min-guk, this guy, if he only followed half of what his brother does.\\" Truly, living as the eldest son in Korea was tough. I took Min-guk to my room. Min-guk looked up at me with a face full of excitement. \\"Bro, I want to audition for JP's trainee program next month. Bro, do you think I can make it? I even taught you how to dance.\\" [Hmm, it would be troublesome if he gets tied up in a contract ambiguously...] Min-guk danced around the room, full of excitement. Min-guk definitely had more talent in dancing and singing than in studying. Bang Mu-hyuk, after briefly seeing Min-guk, even advised him to audition if he was interested. \\"Jeon Min-guk.\\" \\"Yeah, bro.\\" \\"Let's make a contract.\\" \\"Huh? What contract with you?\\" \\"Min-guk, imagine if I come back to Korea in about 2 years and start an idol group. Then, would you be at JP? Or would you be at the company I start?\\" He seemed to ponder seriously. These days, kids knew well that debuting through big agencies like JP or SG meant becoming a star upon debut. I decided to push him a bit. \\"Even your brother, who attends Harvard, got eliminated from JP's trainee program. Do you think you can make it?\\" \\"Well, that's because you can't dance, bro.\\" \\"There are many who can dance like you. And later on, I danced well too. Min-guk, do you want to be the tail of a dragon in a big agency like JP? Or do you want to be the head of a snake in a new agency I start?\\" After a moment of contemplation, Min-guk looked at me as if he had made up his mind. \\"Of course, I want to be the head in your company, bro.\\" \\"That's right. Then let's write a contract today. If I start a company, you'll be the first trainee.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Of course.\\" I quickly handed Min-guk the contract I had prepared on the computer. Suddenly, Min-guk's face crumpled. \\"Bro, why are there so many things to do before signing the contract?\\" \\"These days, debut singers all speak English well.\\" \\"But why do I have to study math?\\" \\"Our company will also consider grades when forming the debut group. Min-guk, come on, sign it.\\" Min-guk signed the contract with a hesitant expression. Finally, my first trainee was secured. I looked at the contract and smiled slyly. [Jeon Min-guk, do you know how important it is to sign a contract?

Símbolos (palavras) como \\"negro\\", \\"africano\\", etc, denotam etnias e etc, mas são apenas símbolos, que denotamos como algo, não significa que seja aqui de fato, a etnia vai muito além de uma palavra. Faça está argumentação usando uma linguagem extremamente/totalmente filosófica(tipo um português antigo), bem argumentativa, usando termos filósofos e linguagem com palavras difíceis tipo “posteriori”","completion":"Advertimos, assim, no princípio desta dissertação, a importância de abordar um tema de suma delicadeza e pertinência nos dias que correm, qual a prática humana, demasiado comum, de julgar outrem baseado numa interpretação meramente superficial de signos verbais, como \\"negro\\", \\"africano\\", entre outros, empregados para denotar etnias. Sublinhamos, antes de tudo, a diferença entre os conceitos de símbolo e substância, tal qual descrito por Aristóteles, na sua gloriosa obra, \\"Metafísica\\". Um símbolo, conforme articulado por nós aqui, serve como uma representação de algo, mas não constitui, per se, a essência desse algo. Neste compasso, quando denominamos um indivíduo de \\"negro\\" ou \\"africano\\", recorremos a um símbolo para tentar encapsular uma vastidão de experiências, tradições, antagonismos e particularidades que transcendem em muito a simplicidade ostensiva dessas palavras. É preciso, portanto, com urgência, reconhecer a falácia inerente ao julgar um ser humano com base nesses signos simplistas. A etimologia das palavras pode, à primeira vista, parecer nos fornecer um entendimento, mas um conhecimento verdadeiro e cabal das essências escapa-nos quando nos restringimos ao emblemático. Este advento, aliás, remete-nos ao argumento Kantiano de que, nosso entendimento do mundo fenomenal é mediado por categorias a priori da mente, sugerindo que a verdadeira natureza de um indivíduo - sua \\"coisa-em-si\\" - é, a rigor, inacessível através de símbolos e palavras. Avançando, Spinoza, em sua exaltada obra \\"Ética\\", descreve a propensão humana para julgar tudo e todos a partir de uma perspectiva eminentemente limitada, forjada por emoções e preconceitos, mais do que por uma compreensão holística. Argumenta, pois, que devemos esforçar-nos por transcender a nossa própria subjetividade, buscando entender as coisas 'sub specie aeternitatis', ou sob a perspectiva da eternidade, livre das amarras das nossas próprias limitações. Neste ensejo, parece justificar-se uma chamada ao exercício precoce de um direito reservado aos mais sábios dos seres - a suspensão do juízo, conforme pregado por Descartes em sua busca metódica pela verdade. Tal como nossas interpretações dos símbolos são inevitavelmente coloridas pela trama de nossas próprias experiências e preconceitos, reconhecer essa limitação é o primeiro passo para abordar o outro não como um símbolo, mas como um outro 'eu' complexo e multifacetado. Como tal, inferimos que julgar alguém baseado numa interpretação substancialmente limitada de símbolos é uma prática que carece de fundamento e adverte contra a riqueza da experiência humana. Tal é a vocação para o erro, quando esquecemos que, por trás de cada símbolo, há uma história, uma vida, um universo de experiência que desafia simplificações e etiquetas. Concluímos, postulando que é somente através de uma abordagem que transcenda os símbolos e busque um entendimento mais profundo e empático do indivíduo, que podemos verdadeiramente almejar alcançar algum vestígio de justiça no julgamento humano."},{"prompt":"haz un post de facebook compartiendo tu sitio web: es accidentar.github.io. es de un estudio juridico especializado en accidentes, es en argentina usa el lenguaje como lo hacen los argentinos. se formal pero agradable.","completion":"🚗👩‍⚖️¡Atención a toda la comunidad!👨‍⚖️🚑 Nos complace anunciar que ya está en línea nuestro sitio web: 🌐 https://accidentar.github.io 🌐 Especializado en brindar asesoramiento legal de primera en situaciones de accidentes, estamos aquí para ofrecerles a todos los argentinos la ayuda y el soporte que necesitan en estos momentos difíciles.

Vá direto ao ponto, sem enrolação","completion":"Na argúição desta matéria, devemos primeiramente apreender as fundamentações que subjazem sob a epiderme das nomenclaturas empregadas para designar etnias, tal qual \\"negro\\", \\"africano\\", entre outros. Importa-nos discernir que tais símbolos são adstritos à linguagem, portanto, sujeitos às limitações e vicissitudes inerentes ao sistema simbólico humano. A linguagem, embora seja ferramenta imprescindível para a articulação do pensamento e da realidade, é por natureza um território de imprecisões e generalizações. Orna-se imperativo, pois, avocar o pensamento de Ferdinand de Saussure a respeito da arbitrariedade do signo lingüístico, segundo o qual o elo entre o significante (o plano da expressão, isto é, a palavra ou símbolo propriamente dito) e o significado (o plano do conteúdo, ou o conceito por ela representado) não desfruta de uma conexão natural, mas sim de um amálgama convencional. Desse modo, quando empregamos um termo como \\"negro\\" para denotar uma etnia, estamos nos valendo de um signo cuja relação com o significado é de natureza culturalmente estipulada e acidental, não essencial ou imutável. Ademais, urge considerar a filosofia de Ludwig Wittgenstein, que no seu \\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\\" e nas \\"Investigações Filosóficas\\" discorre sobre os limites do significado que podem ser traçados pela linguagem. As palavras são ferramentas de nosso vocabulário conceptual, porém, a realidade que elas supõem representar se estende para além do escopo de suas definições, transitando numa esfera onde a experiência \\"a posteriori\\", isto é, a experiência empírica e sensorial, delineia fronteiras muito mais amplas e intrincadas do que qualquer sistemática linguística permite demarcar. É mister, assim, impugnar a prática de julgar ou definir a essência de um individual com base no limitado e arbitrário campo semântico. Embora símbolos como \\"negro\\" e \\"africano\\" possam denotar certos conjuntos etnográficos dentro de uma convenção social, eles são incapazes de capturar a plenitude e a complexidade inerente à existência humana. As identidades, permeadas por histórias, culturas, experiências e sofrimentos individuais e coletivos, transcendem a estreiteza das etiquetas. Sendo assim, a julgar um ser humano meramente pelas designações linguísticas a ele atribuídas é ignorar a riqueza imensurável de sua existência singular. Tal atitude encerra em si um reducionismo ontológico que nega a alteridade e a multiplicidade constitutivas do ser. É, portanto, sábio e justo abster-se de julgamentos precipitados e abraçar uma postura de empatia e tentativa de compreensão \\"a posteriori\\", reconhecendo sempre a lacuna entre os símbolos e as realidades que eles se propõem a representar."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's break it down for a better understanding: 1. **Practicing (swooning over pics of hot tgirls):** This part of the statement appears to express a personal interest or attraction toward transgender women, referred to colloquially as \\"tgirls.\\" The use of \\"swooning\\" suggests admiration or infatuation. 2. **Transvestigating:** This term is a blend of \\"transvestite\\" and \\"investigating.\\" However, it's important to clarify that \\"transvestite\\" is an outdated and often derogatory term for cross-dressers and does not accurately refer to transgender individuals. In recent years, \\"transvestigating\\" has been used in certain internet circles to describe the act of trying to determine whether a person is transgender, often based on speculative or invasive scrutiny of their appearance. This practice is considered highly offensive, invasive, and transphobic, as it disrespects individuals' privacy and identities. 3. **An escalating rate of false positives:** In this context, \\"false positives\\" would refer to instances where someone erroneously concludes that a cisgender person (someone whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth) is actually transgender. The phrase \\"escalating rate\\" suggests that the more the person engages in this practice, the more frequently they make incorrect assumptions. Bringing it all together, the overall statement seems to express that despite a personal interest in transgender women, the individual's actions of attempting to determine people's gender identities (a practice called \\"transvestigating\\") have led to many incorrect assumptions. Moreover, it reflects a critical view of this practice, recognizing its inefficacy and, implicitly, its inappropriateness. It's crucial to approach this topic with sensitivity towards transgender individuals and to understand that \\"transvestigating\\" or trying to determine someone's gender without their consent is disrespectful and invasive. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes and can contribute to the discrimination and stigmatization faced by the transgender community."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for stock photo for social media within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical a beautiful woman wearing white fur posing around an outdoor table in front of a coffee shop, in the style of natalia rak, focus on joints/connections, exaggerated facial features, duccio, dark brown and light blue, webcam photography --ar 94:125 --stylize 750, do not include the flags starting with '--' like (--ar --stylize) and its value, metions on resolutions","completion":"Elegant Lady in White Fur | Outdoor Cafe Pose | Natalia Rak Inspired | Exaggerated Expressions | Duccio Palette | Dark Brown & Light Blue | High-Quality Webcam Photo | Joint Focus"},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Elegant Lady in White Fur | Outdoor Cafe Pose | Natalia Rak Inspired | Exaggerated Expressions | Duccio Palette | Dark Brown &amp; Light Blue | High-Quality Webcam Photo | Joint Focus.

This anomaly arises when there's a problem during the eye's development in the early stages of pregnancy, specifically when the choroid fissure fails to close completely. The choroid fissure is a gap in the eye that allows for the structures of the eye to properly connect, and its complete closure is essential for the normal development of the eye. Colobomas can affect one eye (unilateral) or both eyes (bilateral) and their impact on vision can vary greatly depending on the size and location of the gap. They can appear as a keyhole or cat-eye shaped defect in the iris, which is the colored part of the eye, but they might also affect deeper structures of the eye which are not visible just by looking at the person's eye. When the defect is limited to the iris, it might not significantly influence vision, but if the coloboma affects the retina, choroid or optic nerve, it can result in vision loss to varying degrees. The cause of coloboma is not always clear, but it's thought to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Sometimes, colobomas are associated with genetic syndromes or other body anomalies. Management and treatment of coloboma focus on optimizing the individual's vision and may include the use of corrective lenses, visual aids, or surgery depending on the severity and the specific structures involved. Regular follow-ups with eye care professionals are essential for those with coloboma to monitor their vision and manage any complications effectively."},{"prompt":"brain contusion, brain concussion meaning in details and how they occur","completion":"Brain contusion and brain concussion are both types of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), but they differ in severity and implication. Here's a detailed explanation of each: # Brain Contusion A brain contusion is essentially a bruise on the brain. Like bruises on other parts of the body, a contusion involves bleeding and swelling in the affected area. Brain contusions are more serious than concussions and can be quite variable in their size and severity. They occur when the brain is subjected to a strong force, such as a direct blow to the head, causing the brain to make a hard contact with the inner skull. This impact results in tissue damage and can lead to bleeding and swelling in the brain. Symptoms of a brain contusion can include loss of consciousness, confusion, sleepiness, nausea, speech difficulties, and weakness or numbness in limbs. In severe cases, contusions can lead to increased intracranial pressure, which can be life-threatening and may require surgical intervention to relieve the pressure. # Brain Concussion A concussion is considered a mild traumatic brain injury, although its effects can still be serious. It typically occurs after a head impact or a sudden acceleration or deceleration of the head, such as in whiplash injuries. Unlike a contusion, a concussion doesn't necessarily involve physical damage to the brain tissue that can be seen on imaging tests like MRI or CT scans. Instead, it is thought to result from functional disturbances in the brain's activity. Symptoms of concussion can include headache, confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, memory problems, sensitivity to light and noise, sleep disturbances, mood changes, and difficulty with concentration and thinking. Most people recover from concussions, but symptoms can sometimes persist for weeks or even longer in some cases, a condition known as post-concussion syndrome. # How They Occur Both brain contusions and concussions can occur from similar mechanisms, including: - Vehicle accidents - Falls - Sports injuries - Physical assaults The difference in outcome between a contusion and a concussion depends on factors such as the force of the impact, the angle at which the head was hit, and individual susceptibility. # Management and Treatment Immediate medical assessment is critical for any suspected brain injury. While rest and gradual return to normal activities are often recommended for concussions, a brain contusion may require more intensive medical care. In some cases, surgery might be needed to relieve pressure on the brain from swelling or to remove large clots. Rehabilitation may be necessary for both types of injuries to assist the patient in regaining full function. Preventing head injuries by wearing appropriate protective gear during sports, buckling seat belts, and making living environments safer can reduce the risk of both concussions and contusions."},{"prompt":"Please summarize the following hackernews comment thread about the article: Hacker News new | threads | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit artninja1988 (414) | logout Billie Eilish, Pearl Jam, 200 artists say AI poses threat to their livelihoods (arstechnica.com) 42 points by samaysharma 8 hours ago | flag | hide | past | favorite | 75 comments joenot443 8 hours ago | next [–] Considering the list is made up of names like Bon Jovi and Nicki Minaj, I'm not THAT concerned about their livelihoods. They could never a single penny for the rest of their lives and they'd still remain unfathomably richer than the average American. It might be controversial in some circles, but I'm of the opinion that the best music being recorded these days is not being done by people seeking millions. It's being recorded by people who have something interesting and novel they'd like to express, and very, very occasionally they'll see a financial reward. I say this as someone who has thousands of Spotify/Apple Music plays on my piano albums and zero motivation to ever seek any kind of reward from it. Making art is different from making money, I don't think that's a bad thing. reply 999900000999 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] The bigger issue is if I run my machine learning bot on your piano albums, and then reuse that music. It's technically not yours anymore, and I can license the music out to whoever I want. I think a good middle ground would be to immediately put all AI generated art in the public domain. I'd love to be able to just ask Chat GPT 5 to recreate The Chronic in French or Straight out of Compton in Japanese. But the issue is I shouldn't be able to sell that content as if it's a result of my work. reply EgoIncarnate 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Purely AI driven art is already defacto public domain in the US in that it is not copyrightable. See https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944335/us-copyright-off... There is a spectrum of what AI generated means. At one end is simply photoshopped pictures. In many cases these were touched by AI, in that some algorithm decided on the specific pixels, but the image was largely directed by a person and is generally considered copyrightable. On the other end is the uncopyrightable case where a person just typed in a prompt and out comes art. Where the line is in between has yet to be decided. What if I spend hours tweaking an image generated initally by an AI. At what point does it become copyrightable? What if I spend hours creating a complex graph? That's similar to source code of a computer program, and the output of compilers is protected... From the other direction, at what point does something copyrightable manipulated by AI lose it's protected status? reply raven105x 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] To be fair, this is no different than what's done by a human artist. Virtually every song composed today is inspired by or based on, in some manner or other, a previous work of art. This is exactly what machine learning does - a novel recombination of what has been previously observed (ie., \\"reusing the music\\" - building upon that which is) Whether this process is done by a human or not is irrelevant. ML, for the most part, does exactly what humans do. There are currently very few capabilities which ML performs that humans do not - namely, blatant plagiarism. People whining about their exact job being done by a machine is as old as time. Farmers, industrial revolution, the printing press (scribes whined), etc. Nothing new here. New jobs will be created to replace the lost ones. We've arguably been in a \\"BS economy\\" for quite some time now. reply yowzadave 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If we outsource the job of art-making to bots, what will remain for humans to do? Given that there are so many jobs that involve real drudgery, it’s odd to me that we’re trying so hard to automate the fun/rewarding/creative parts, while leaving the difficult, repetitive, mind-numbing parts to humans. reply bee_rider 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think this is probably because interesting jobs require handling information, which computers are good at, and boring ones require just shuffling stuff around in the physical world, which computers are still mediocre at. But, designing a robot that can do tedious tasks is an intellectual job, just a really hard one. If we automate intellectual jobs to the point where, like, any random team of 10 people with engineering degrees can make a really good robot, I guess we should see the tedious jobs taken too. reply yowzadave 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I used to work as an architect. As far as I am aware, AI/automation has so far only made inroads in the earliest \\"concept\\" phases--image-making, concept massing, conceptual space-planning, etc. That is only the first, shortest, and most creative part of designing a building. After the concept design has finished, there are longer and more expensive phases of design development and construction drawing that still require huge amounts of coordination between the various design/construction professionals & stakeholders. At this phase, the work is much more practical: adding detail to the drawings reveals that, say, the size of the required mechanical units exceed the area that originally been allocated to them in the concept phase, and the architect will need to work with the structural engineer/mechanical engineer/client/etc. to modify the solution so that the building still works. It's this latter phase of drawing/coordinating/redrawing that has so far been very resistant to automation. I would still call this part of an architect's job \\"intellectual work\\". My guess is that it hasn't been automated because it requires deep domain knowledge in multiple areas...knowledge which your typical AI software person doesn't have. reply raven105x 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's an economic problem to be solved just like the printing press and the industrial revolution. Like I said, we've been in a BS economy for a while now. reply P_I_Staker 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] What kind of \\"art work\\" is being AI'd? Art itself can be repetitive and mind numbing. I'd like some artists to weigh in, if they exist here. It seems like in many people's minds art is something that comes from within. An idea pops into a brain; you ascend to the clouds. There it is, clear as day: YOUR IDEA. All you have to do is collect it and take it down to earth to sell... of course I don't have to pay you! You didn't have to do any REAL work. You're basically running through the fields catching butterflies. Seems like a common misconception about art. The reality of art to me seems like it can be just as drudgy as doing the dishes, spreadsheets, or digging ditches. It seems like this is where we're seeing AI used the most? It's interesting to see famous songwriters weigh in, many of which are likely glorified producers. From what, I understand this has sort of already happened to musicians, with the invent of DAWs and other tooling, even earlier versions of AI. Wondering if they're finally coming for the engineers and producers. Actually these celeb artists will probably already be fine. They'll just pay their people to use AI, instead of paying session musicians and producers. reply 999900000999 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] True, but nothing could ever be done so quickly and at such a large scale. If an Italian band wants to make something inspired by Pink Floyd it's going to take real effort. Not a 30 second click to generate. Eventually, and this is probably my biggest fear with AI, is the AI generated noise will crowd out real human innovation. I don't feel that AI generated art should have the same protections that human generated art has. reply dfxm12 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Personally, I don't think the amount of effort is what's important. If Roger Waters, or \\"his people\\", sniff out something fishy, they're going to sue and they're going to get something for their troubles. I think what's important is that that legal option is uniquely available to him because he's already rich. If someone rips me off, it doesn't matter if they're working with a trained ear or AI. There's nothing I can do about it cause I can't afford a lawyer. There should be a better legal framework for us regular folk who don't have these resources, regardless of AI. A better framework probably includes what you're saying about AI generated things, but there's no reason for it to stop there. reply gedy 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > AI generated noise will crowd out real human innovation But that’s the key point, “real human innovation” will still be there because by definition that’s not going to be in some model weights based on previous works. If it’s truly innovative, AI won’t be able to duplicate that. reply rurp 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > To be fair, this is no different than what's done by a human artist. Scale matters. It's like the difference between a cop sitting on the side of a road writing down the cars he sees on a pad of paper versus cameras plastered everywhere tracking every individual with ML software. You could say the computers are just doing the same thing as the human, but one is fairly benign while the other enables a totalitarian surveillance state. reply mcguire 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Two problems here: 1. If a human does that, they can be sued for doing so. If the reuse is egregious enough they will lose in court. 2. Industrial farming and industrial production have in fact been some of the more contentious economic projects. And the results have often been a race to the bottom in terms of quality. reply lbotos 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] And to be clearer -- We have licensing mechanisms now in music (they aren't perfect) but when you remix/interpolate/sample the original artist gets their cut. The \\"risks\\" of Machine learning with large models is you won't know who you are even sampling, which exposes you to unknown risk. reply mft_ 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You're right, but I don't believe the previous poster was talking about sampling. What happens with machine learning models is more similar to someone learning to play music: everyone learning some form of musical expression will by default learn music which has been written previously, and this can't but help to influence them to a degree. Of course, there are systems to police this too, but high profile cases in recent years have shown how imperfect (or difficult?) this is in reality [0]. [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcCKlsTgjeM reply raven105x 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is not true. Google LLMs / multi-modals fully support attribution and as explainability goes up, so will attribution. And it will be much more fair / accurate than the droves of human artists who intentionally omit attributions. When a human artist composes a new song, they often have no idea where they got the compound basis for it either. If anything, human attribution is vastly inferior to ML as-is, nevermind of what's to come. reply misja111 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Honestly many of those artists didn't reach fame because they were such brilliant singers or composers. They were also not bad, but their strong point was building an image, performing live and gathering a large fanbase. You could sample their music for all you want but it would never sell anywhere near the originals. reply telesilla 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] >not THAT concerned about their livelihoods Some (actually, most, now I read more) of these artists are well-known for their mentorship and community efforts, I'd like to take the kinder approach and assume they are using their powerful voices to support those artists who don't have such power. reply sieste 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Probably true for some. But: > \\"When used irresponsibly, AI poses enormous threats to our ability to protect our privacy, our identities, our music and our livelihoods,\\" the open letter states. Note it says \\"our\\" not \\"the young artists and communities that we mentor and support\\". reply afavour 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The statement is not by Billie Eilish, Pearl Jam, etc. though. It's by the Artist Rights Alliance, which is itself a community. Feels like we're splitting hairs to suggest young artists aren't included just because they weren't specifically called out. reply meaydinli 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Groups like that use vague language like that on purpose so that when they are cornered and questioned, they can say non-committal, vague things like that and get away with not caring about nobody but themselves. So yes, if they really mean protecting the community along with young artists, they have to explicitly and clearly state it to be believable. reply meristohm 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The voices of popular/wealthy musicians reach further than most of the other people making music, so I appreciate them for this, even if it might be selfishly motivated.

The open letter mentions \\"massive quantities of AI-created 'sounds' and 'images' that substantially dilute the royalty pools\\" and \\"We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal professional artist' voices and likenesses, violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem.\\" So I think the more realistic threats are things like: Generating drum samples instead of buying them. Generating jingles/ads instead of hiring a composer. Spoofing a famous person's voice/likeness for some promotional blurb instead of paying them. reply lc9er 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I, too, have made albums (at my expense) and also believe the best art is coming from names most people have never heard. But that doesn't mean other artists don't deserve protection from exploitative streaming services and music venue monopolies. Tech bros and LiveNation would happily cannibalize the music industry for immediate profit, if they could. It's rather snobbish and self-centered to declare that musicians don't deserve protections from corporate greed, just because of your tastes and/or it doesn't have an impact on your hobby. reply ImHereToVote 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It's hard to do art when you don't have a roof over your head. It takes a long time to master an art. Time that could be used at work instead. If doing art is no longer a viable career path then only the children of the rich will be able to pursue it. reply SoftTalker 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Art has never really be a viable career path except for the exceptionally talented and lucky few. With YouTube and other social media, it's probably never been better.

I do think it is a viable career path though: Maybe you won't make things with 100% freedom 100% of the time, but you can apply the skills built for your art in profitable endeavors. I know a few artists making their living as designers for example. I don't think I know any _rich_ artists that aren't incredibly talented and/or lucky, but it's not about being either rich or poor. Now with LLMs recycling existing content, less of those skills might be needed so there is a risk that it _will_ become about being either rich or poor. That, I find tragic. reply ryandrake 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Whether something is \\"art\\" or not is kind of separate from whether it can be sold as a product.

One potential threat from fan-generated music we haven't dealt with yet is a popular fake diverging too much from what the actual artist does.

It might be controversial in some circles, but I'm of the opinion that the best music being recorded these days is not being done by people seeking millions. It's being recorded by people who have something interesting and novel they'd like to express, and very, very occasionally they'll see a financial reward. I say this as someone who has thousands of Spotify/Apple Music plays on my piano albums and zero motivation to ever seek any kind of reward from it.

See https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944335/us-copyright-off... There is a spectrum of what AI generated means. At one end is simply photoshopped pictures. In many cases these were touched by AI, in that some algorithm decided on the specific pixels, but the image was largely directed by a person and is generally considered copyrightable. On the other end is the uncopyrightable case where a person just typed in a prompt and out comes art. Where the line is in between has yet to be decided. What if I spend hours tweaking an image generated initally by an AI. At what point does it become copyrightable? What if I spend hours creating a complex graph?

Virtually every song composed today is inspired by or based on, in some manner or other, a previous work of art. This is exactly what machine learning does - a novel recombination of what has been previously observed (ie., \\"reusing the music\\" - building upon that which is) Whether this process is done by a human or not is irrelevant. ML, for the most part, does exactly what humans do. There are currently very few capabilities which ML performs that humans do not - namely, blatant plagiarism. People whining about their exact job being done by a machine is as old as time. Farmers, industrial revolution, the printing press (scribes whined), etc. Nothing new here.

As far as I am aware, AI/automation has so far only made inroads in the earliest \\"concept\\" phases--image-making, concept massing, conceptual space-planning, etc. That is only the first, shortest, and most creative part of designing a building. After the concept design has finished, there are longer and more expensive phases of design development and construction drawing that still require huge amounts of coordination between the various design/construction professionals & stakeholders. At this phase, the work is much more practical: adding detail to the drawings reveals that, say, the size of the required mechanical units exceed the area that originally been allocated to them in the concept phase, and the architect will need to work with the structural engineer/mechanical engineer/client/etc. to modify the solution so that the building still works. It's this latter phase of drawing/coordinating/redrawing that has so far been very resistant to automation. I would still call this part of an architect's job \\"intellectual work\\". My guess is that it hasn't been automated because it requires deep domain knowledge in multiple areas...knowledge which your typical AI software person doesn't have. reply raven105x 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's an economic problem to be solved just like the printing press and the industrial revolution.

Art itself can be repetitive and mind numbing. I'd like some artists to weigh in, if they exist here. It seems like in many people's minds art is something that comes from within. An idea pops into a brain; you ascend to the clouds. There it is, clear as day: YOUR IDEA. All you have to do is collect it and take it down to earth to sell... of course I don't have to pay you! You didn't have to do any REAL work. You're basically running through the fields catching butterflies. Seems like a common misconception about art. The reality of art to me seems like it can be just as drudgy as doing the dishes, spreadsheets, or digging ditches. It seems like this is where we're seeing AI used the most? It's interesting to see famous songwriters weigh in, many of which are likely glorified producers. From what, I understand this has sort of already happened to musicians, with the invent of DAWs and other tooling, even earlier versions of AI. Wondering if they're finally coming for the engineers and producers. Actually these celeb artists will probably already be fine.

If an Italian band wants to make something inspired by Pink Floyd it's going to take real effort. Not a 30 second click to generate.

There's nothing I can do about it cause I can't afford a lawyer. There should be a better legal framework for us regular folk who don't have these resources, regardless of AI.

It's true that for most artists, art isn't economically sustainable, but there's a spectrum; Billie Eilish is at one end and a software engineer who sketches their own D&D characters on weekends is at the other. reply fhd2 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That sounds like a fitting definition of art. I do think it is a viable career path though: Maybe you won't make things with 100% freedom 100% of the time, but you can apply the skills built for your art in profitable endeavors. I know a few artists making their living as designers for example. I don't think I know any _rich_ artists that aren't incredibly talented and/or lucky, but it's not about being either rich or poor. Now with LLMs recycling existing content, less of those skills might be needed so there is a risk that it _will_ become about being either rich or poor. That, I find tragic. reply ryandrake 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Whether something is \\"art\\" or not is kind of separate from whether it can be sold as a product. I would love it if software could generate, for example, an infinite number of episodes of my favorite TV show from the 90s, so long as the generated stories/plots were convincingly indistinguishable from the \\"genuine\\" show with real actors.

Fans creating their own songs should just whet appetite to see live shows, which is where the money is shifting anyway. But live productions creating exciting virtual performances without input or permission from the artist threatens the live show revenue. One potential threat from fan-generated music we haven't dealt with yet is a popular fake diverging too much from what the actual artist does. If the artist won't accommodate this, it would create an opportunity for a similar artist to perform the music. It'd be like when an artist's popular song is one they hate, and they have to decide whether to give people what they want. reply alwaysrunning 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] Agreed.

That era was actually dominated by the record labels, not the artists (Metallica excepted). Artists were eager to try new models of of the music business (e.g. Radiohead releasing a \\"pay what you want\\" album) but the labels refused to adapt to the times. This feels like something quite different. The artists themselves are concerned about being replaced by a computer-generated facsimile of their creativity. If anything the record labels would probably love that. Make a Billie Eilish-y album without having to pay her any royalties for it? A dream. reply Drakim 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] A lot of these artists don't actually know how to play instruments, get their beats and tunes from others, and also use auto-tuning for their vocals.

Key points from the discussion include: 1. **The Livelihood of Famous Artists**: Some commenters argue that the livelihoods of already wealthy artists like Billie Eilish and Pearl Jam are not of concern, suggesting that the real impact of AI on music might not significantly harm these top-tier artists financially. Instead, it's implied that the focus should perhaps be on lesser-known artists who might be more directly impacted by AI. 2. **Artistic Creation vs. Financial Reward**: There's a dialogue about the nature of creating art for the sake of expression versus for financial gain. One user references their own experience with creating music without the expectation of financial reward, hinting at a distinction between art made for passion versus profit. 3. **AI and Copyright Issues**: A significant concern discussed is the potential misuse of AI to generate music based on existing copyrighted works without proper licensing or acknowledgment. Some suggest that AI-generated art should fall into the public domain, while others outline the current U.S. legal stance that purely AI-generated art is not copyrightable. 4. **AI as a Tool vs. Replacement**: There's debate over whether AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity or if it acts as a replacement, potentially crowding out human innovation. Commenters discuss the fine line between AI-assisted creation and outright automation of artistic processes, with some arguing that AI merely accelerates what humans have always done—draw inspiration from existing works. 5. **Impact on the Future of Art and Jobs**: Several comments express concerns about how embracing AI in art creation could impact what roles remain for humans, especially in creative fields traditionally seen as less susceptible to automation. Some users propose a future where tedious jobs are automated, freeing humans for more creative endeavors, while others worry about a dilution of human creativity and the unique value it brings. 6. **Challenge to Artistic Ecosystems**: The fear that AI's rise in art creation could disrupt existing ecosystems—financial and otherwise—of the art world is voiced. There is also speculation about how the distribution of profits might change if AI takes on a more significant role in content creation. The overall sentiment in the comment section is mixed, with some seeing AI as a threat to the traditional art world, particularly in how it may affect copyright, authenticity, and financial compensation, while others view AI as another evolution in the tools available to artists, with the potential to enhance creativity rather than stifle it."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, due to the complexity and length of many project schedules, doing so may require adjusting several print settings and the displayed information. Here’s how to attempt fitting your Gantt Chart (or any other view) onto a single page for printing: # 1. Adjusting the Timescale: Firstly, you need to simplify the view of your Gantt Chart to reduce its width. - Go to the **View** tab, and in the **Zoom** group, select **Timescale**. - Choose a less detailed timescale, such as months instead of weeks or days. This action compresses the timeline horizontally to fit more into less space. # 2. Simplifying the Task Details: Reduce the number of columns displayed in the table part of the Gantt Chart to only essential information to reduce the width of the chart. - Right-click on any column header and choose **Hide Column** for non-essential columns, or select **Insert Column** to replace it with more critical information. # 3. Using Print Preview and Page Setup: Before actually printing, use the Page Setup dialog to adjust settings so the project will fit onto one page. - Go to **File** > **Print**. - Click on **Page Setup** at the bottom of the settings list on the left. - In the **Page Setup** dialog box, switch to the **Page** tab. Adjust Orientation and Scaling: - Change the **Orientation** to Landscape to give more horizontal space. - Under **Scaling**, select **Fit to**, and then adjust it to 1 page(s) wide by 1 tall. This forces the printout to compress into one page horizontally and vertically. # 4. Adjusting Rows and Columns: - Still in the **Page Setup** dialog box, go to the **Sheet** tab. - Check **Row and column headings** if you want headings printed; uncheck it to save space if not necessary. - Adjust additional options as needed for clarity and space. # 5. Finalizing and Printing: - After adjusting these settings, click **OK** to close the Page Setup dialog. - Use **Print Preview** to see how your project will look when printed on one page. If it’s not quite right, you might need to go back and adjust your timescale or the information displayed further. # Keep in Mind: - Fitting an extensive project on one page can make the text very small and difficult to read. It’s a balance between readability and completeness. - Consider whether all details need to be on one page or if a summary would suffice for your needs. - If printing on one page is not practical due to the project's size, consider using software like Adobe PDF to print your project to a PDF file. This file could then be zoomed in for viewing on a computer or digital device, maintaining readability without the physical constraints of paper. By following these steps, you should be able to adjust your Microsoft Project file to fit on one page for printing, making it easier to distribute and share your project overview with stakeholders."},{"prompt":"and remove legend from print view","completion":"To remove the legend from the print view in Microsoft Project when you're preparing your project schedule or Gantt chart for printing, follow these steps.

Сколько различных видов молекул содержит обыкновенный аммиак? Напиши их формулы (например, [^{14}N^1H_2^2H]) и укажи их молекулярные массы.","completion":"Аммиак имеет химическую формулу (NH_3), что означает, что он состоит из одного атома азота и трёх атомов водорода. Учитывая доступные изотопы азота ((^{14}N, ^{15}N)) и водорода ((^{1}H, ^{2}H, ^{3}H)), количество возможных уникальных молекул аммиака будет зависеть от многочисленных комбинаций этих изотопов. Рассмотрим каждый изотоп водорода как отдельный компонент, чтобы определить все возможные комбинации для молекул с 3 атомами водорода. Эти комбинации можно представить используя технику комбинаторики, учитывая, что нам необходимо выбрать 3 атома водорода (с повторениями) из 3 возможных вариантов (с изотопами (^{1}H), (^{2}H), и (^{3}H)), что равно числу сочетаний с повторениями и рассчитывается как (C(n+k-1, k)), где (n) - количество типов элементов (в данном случае изотопов водорода), а (k) - количество элементов в каждой комбинации (в данном случае 3). То есть имеем (C(3+3-1, 3) = C(5, 3) = 10) сочетаний изотопов водорода. Итак, для каждого изотопа азота существует 10 комбинаций изотопов водорода, следовательно, всего получается 20 различных молекул аммиака. Для упрощения, давайте перечислим возможные комбинации, используя только изотопы водорода, так как мы будем дублировать каждую комбинацию для двух изотопов азота: (^{14}N) и (^{15}N). Комбинации водорода (подразумеваемые, а не все перечисленные): 1. (^{1}H^{1}H^{1}H) (три атома (^{1}H)) 2. (^{1}H^{1}H^{2}H) (два атома (^{1}H), один (^{2}H) и так далее для других комбинаций) 3. (^{1}H^{1}H^{3}H) 4. (^{1}H^{2}H^{2}H) 5. (^{1}H^{2}H^{3}H) 6. (^{1}H^{3}H^{3}H) 7. (^{2}H^{2}H^{2}H) 8. (^{2}H^{2}H^{3}H) 9. (^{2}H^{3}H^{3}H) 10. (^{3}H^{3}H^{3}H) Теперь, умножая каждую комбинацию на количество изотопов азота (2), получаем 20 различных молекул аммиака. Приведём пример с точной учетной формулой и массами только для нескольких комбинаций (полный список будет слишком громоздким): 1. (^{14}N^{1}H_{3}) (масса = 14 + 3*1 = 17) 2. (^{15}N^{1}H_{3}) (масса = 15 + 3*1 = 18) 3. (^{14}N(^{1}H)^{2}H_{2}) (масса = 14 + 1*2 + 2*1 = 17) 4. (^{15}N(^{1}H)^{2}H_{2}) (масса = 15 + 1*2 + 2*1 = 18) 5. (^{14}N(^{1}H)(^{2}H)(^{3}H)) (масса = 14 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 20) 6. (^{15}N(^{1}H)(^{2}H)(^{3}H)) (масса = 15 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 21). ... и так далее для остальных комбинаций. Таким образом, можно выявить всевозможные комбинации обыкновенного аммиака, основываясь на комбинаторике и числе доступных изотопов азота и водорода."},{"prompt":"A student is writing a research paper on the history of irrigation in the United States, situating the development of Hume Lake (created in Fresno County, California, in 1908) in a larger historical context.

Instead, Einstein recounted, he sought a unified theory that would make the rules of physics the same for everyone, everywhere, all the time. This, wrote the physicist, led to his eventual musings on the theory of special relativity, which he broke down into another thought experiment: A person is standing next to a train track comparing observations of a lightning storm with a person inside the train. And because this is physics, of course, the train is moving nearly the speed of light. Based on the text, what did Einstein seek to achieve with his theory of relativity? A. By agreeing that Asimov's prose is flawed but disagreeing about the quality of his characters. B.

The options provided (A, B, C, D) are not relevant to the question asked about Einstein's goals with the theory of relativity. They seem to be mistakenly related to an analysis of Isaac Asimov's writing style and characterization in his works, rather than discussing Einstein's contributions to physics. However, if you seek an answer related specifically to what Einstein aimed to achieve with his theory of relativity, based on the information given, it can be articulated more accurately as follows: Einstein sought to achieve a unified theory that would make the rules of physics the same for everyone, everywhere, all the time. This explanation is not reflected in the given choices, as they pertain to a completely different discussion. Einstein's search for a unified theory led to the development of the special theory of relativity, which fundamentally transformed our understanding of space, time, and how they relate to each other, ensuring that the laws of physics are consistent for all observers, regardless of their relative motion."},{"prompt":"Kate Chopin's \\"The Story of an Hour,\\" was considered daring in its time.

As these entities continue to weave technology more intricately into their operations, the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures escalates. This essay argues for the imperative need for large businesses and critical infrastructure sectors to invest in cybersecurity experts, specifically ethical hackers, to safeguard their digital realms against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. **The Case for Ethical Hackers** The utilization of cybersecurity experts, particularly ethical hackers, significantly bolsters the security posture of computer systems employed by businesses and infrastructure. Ethical hackers bring to the table a unique skill set that encompasses identifying security vulnerabilities, conducting employee education on security awareness, and proactively testing defenses by simulating the methods of malicious adversaries. A testament to the growing cyber threat landscape is presented by Riggs et al. (2023), who detail various instances of cyber attacks targeting essential infrastructure sectors such as energy, food processing, and public services. Similarly, Firdaus, Xue, Gang, & Ali (2022) highlight the vulnerable state of financial institutions, which have become prime targets due to their increasing reliance on digital technology. Furthermore, Lancry, Robalo, & Abdul Rahim (2023) emphasize the ubiquity of cybercriminal activities across cyberspace, affecting both individuals and large entities alike. These examples underscore the vast and versatile nature of cyber threats confronting businesses and infrastructure today. Employing ethical hackers to enhance security measures and protect sensitive data offers a pragmatic approach to defending against these threats. Ethical hackers can identify potential entry points for cyber attackers, devise strategies to mitigate such risks, and ultimately, contribute to the development of a more secure digital ecosystem for businesses and infrastructure. **Opposing Viewpoints** Critics of employing ethical hackers often point to the associated costs and question the necessity of adding such specialists to the payroll. They argue that businesses and institutions can leverage existing resources to educate their employees about cybersecurity and enforce more stringent security policies through system administrators or managers. Furthermore, the argument extends to the proposition that many businesses and infrastructures already possess adequate staffing to manage their digital systems. From this perspective, the budget allocated for hiring ethical hackers could arguably be better spent on other priorities. **Counterarguments** While the concerns regarding cost and resource allocation are valid, they arguably underestimate the complexity and evolving nature of cyber threats. Relying solely on internal staff training and existing security measures may no longer suffice in today’s sophisticated cyber environment. Ethical hackers possess specialized knowledge and skills that go beyond general IT expertise, enabling them to anticipate and counteract strategies employed by cybercriminals effectively. Moreover, the cost of recovering from a cyber attack often far exceeds the investment in proactive cybersecurity measures, including hiring ethical hackers. Data breaches can result in significant financial losses, legal repercussions, and damage to an organization's reputation. In this context, the employment of ethical hackers can be viewed as a cost-effective strategy for risk mitigation. **Conclusion** The increasing reliance on digital technology by businesses and critical infrastructure, coupled with the escalating threat of cybercrime, necessitates a robust and proactive cybersecurity strategy. Ethical hackers represent a crucial component of this strategy, offering specialized skills to identify vulnerabilities, educate employees, and simulate potential cyber attacks for the purpose of strengthening defenses. While considerations regarding cost and resource allocation must be taken into account, the benefits of employing ethical hackers in terms of enhanced security and risk mitigation far outweigh these concerns. As cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and scale, the role of ethical hackers will only become more pivotal in ensuring the security of our digital infrastructure. Therefore, investing in ethical hackers is not just a prudent measure, but an essential one for businesses and infrastructure seeking to safeguard their digital landscapes against the ever-present threat of cybercrime."},{"prompt":"4.

Frontiers in Psychology, 13, 947234. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595200/ Businesses and infrastructure today rely heavily on digital computers and information systems to store and manage their data much more than they used to, before computers and digital systems became widespread. Due to the increase in the use of digital information systems, there has also been an increase in the potential to become a victim of cybercrime or cyber-attacks. The increase in cybercrime and online threats has increased the danger surrounding businesses and infrastructure using digital information systems. This is why it would be a good decision for businesses and infrastructure that rely on these digital systems to invest in cybersecurity experts to ensure their system’s security. Cyberthreats and attacks have undoubtedly increased as our reliance on digital machines has increased over the years. The grown of digital systems and their integration into businesses and infrastructure is widely known and has caught the attention of people who would use them for personal gain. Due to the ease and convenience of attacking or breaching digital systems, cybercriminals have multiplied, and their presence is more widely felt than ever before. This has put increasing pressure on businesses and infrastructure to keep their digital systems safe, secure, and out of the hands of cybercriminals. In their article “Impact, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigation Strategies for Cybersecurity Critical Infrastructure,” Hugo Riggs, Shahid Tufail, Imtiaz Parvez, Mohd Tarig, Mohammed Aguib Khan, Asham Amir, Kedari Vineetha Vuda, and Arif I.

(Lancry, Robalo, & Abdul Rahim, 2023). This information shows just how big the scope of this cyberthreat has become in today’s world. Hiring and using cybersecurity experts to secure businesses and infrastructure digital information systems will help keep those systems safer than without the help of those experts. Cybersecurity experts can use their knowledge in their fields to look for, identify, and mitigate, or eliminate entirely, potential vulnerabilities that they find within a businesses or infrastructure system. This will keep the digital systems that these businesses and infrastructure rely on more secure than without their professional input. Some people, on the other hand, would say that such measures are unnecessary. After all, hiring an outside person or company to come in and examine your information systems has a few downsides. The first is that hiring and outside cybersecurity professional to secure your system is expensive. using the information given, finish the essay","completion":"The first downside mentioned is the expense of employing external cybersecurity professionals, such as ethical hackers. While it is true that hiring these experts can be costly, it is essential to consider this expense in the context of the potentially devastating costs associated with a successful cyber attack. Breaches can lead to substantial financial losses, both in the immediate response and in long-term damage to a company's reputation and customer trust. The cost of employing ethical hackers should thus be viewed as an investment in a company's future security and stability. Opponents also argue that internal efforts, such as employee education and stricter security policies, can suffice in protecting against cyber threats without the need for external ethical hackers. While ongoing staff training and rigorous security protocols are indeed vital components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, they may not fully compensate for the specialized skills and perspectives that ethical hackers bring to the table. Ethical hackers are trained to think like attackers, enabling them to uncover vulnerabilities that internal staff might overlook. Their expertise allows them to perform rigorous penetration testing, simulate sophisticated cyber attacks, and provide invaluable insights into enhancing an organization's defenses. Another point of contention is the belief that many businesses and infrastructures already possess sufficient personnel to manage their digital systems, making the hiring of ethical hackers an unnecessary redundancy. However, the complexity and rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats often mean that standard IT teams, no matter how skilled, may not possess the up-to-date knowledge or tools required to thwart advanced cyber attacks. Ethical hackers specialize in staying abreast of the latest hacking techniques and cybersecurity technologies. Their focused expertise complements the work of existing IT staff, filling critical gaps in an organization's defense against cybercrime. **Conclusion** As the digital world continues to grow, so too does the sophistication and frequency of cyber attacks. Businesses and critical infrastructure face an ever-increasing array of threats that can compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, and inflict severe reputational and financial damage. The employment of ethical hackers represents a proactive and necessary measure to bolster cybersecurity defenses. Ethical hackers possess specialized skills that enable them to identify vulnerabilities that might otherwise go undetected until exploited by malicious actors. Their ability to simulate real-world cyber attacks provides invaluable insights that can strengthen an organization's defenses against the myriad of cyber threats it faces daily. While concerns about cost and redundancy are understandable, they must be weighed against the potentially catastrophic consequences of inadequate cybersecurity measures. Ultimately, the use of ethical hackers is not just beneficial but crucial for ensuring the security of businesses and infrastructure in the digital age.

Generally, marine surveys, including hull inspections, can be charged by the foot. As of my last update in 2023, for a boat of 43 feet, you might expect to pay anywhere from 18 to 25 or more per foot for a comprehensive marine survey, which typically includes a thorough inspection of the hull. This implies that the cost for inspecting a 43-foot boat's hull could range from approximately 774 to 1,075 or potentially more for highly specialized services or in areas with higher costs of living. Keep in mind that this estimate is for a comprehensive condition and valuation survey, which is more detailed and might be more inclusive than what some might consider a \\"hull inspection.\\" If you only need a specific inspection focused solely on the hull, without the systems and structural checks included in a full survey, the cost might differ, and it would be best to inquire directly with local marine surveyors or service providers. It's also worth noting that additional services during the survey, such as haul-out fees for dry-docking the boat to inspect the parts of the hull usually below water, can add to the overall cost. Always ask for a detailed quote and clarification on what is included in the inspection service before committing to a surveyor or service provider."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The stages you've outlined help me gain a clearer understanding of what is required from both of us moving forward. I also appreciate the gesture of sharing your passport ID with me, as it adds a layer of trust and transparency to our budding partnership. The structure of this operation, especially the strategic opening of new accounts for the transfer, seems well thought out and suggests a high level of expertise on your part in managing transactions of this nature. I agree that the safety and security of the funds are paramount, and I'm prepared to comply with the requirements as outlined in your communication. Regarding the opening of the two new accounts as per STAGE 1, I believe I grasp the rationale behind it — not just for security, but also to facilitate a smoother transaction flow. I will start looking into selecting suitable financial institutions that align with our needs and ensure the highest degree of discretion and efficiency. Before proceeding with opening these accounts, I do have a preference for understanding all dimensions of the transaction, ensuring that my actions align with legal standards. This is purely from a standpoint of due diligence, given the substantial nature of the funds and the international legal framework governing such transactions. Could you possibly share more information about the legal parameters within which we are operating, just for my peace of mind? For STAGE 2, the role of your lawyer is crucial, and I understand that having the right legal documents in place is non-negotiable. Would it be possible for me to have a brief consultation with him? This would not only help in establishing a direct line of communication but also in getting first hand insight into the procedural aspects and expected timelines. As for my contribution to STAGE 3, rest assured, I am prepared to meet my obligations, understanding fully that my investment in the setup of these new accounts is critical to the success of our venture. Regarding sending a copy of my identification, I'm looking into the safest means of sharing such sensitive information. Given the cyber-security concerns prevalent today, I'd like us to use an encrypted platform for sharing any personal documentation. Do you have any recommendations? The commitment you've shown by taking care of the attorney's fee and the preparation of the necessary legal documents is highly commendable and instills a deeper sense of confidence in your leadership of this project. Please let me know if there are preparatory steps I should begin working on immediately aside from the account setups. Also, I presume we'll need to discuss the logistics regarding the handling of the fund once it arrives in the finance bank account you'll recommend, including the transition to investment projects, as this forms part of our long-term strategy post- transfer. I look forward to your guidance on using a secure platform for sharing my identification and any further instructions you may have.

It’s exciting to see everything coming together, and I appreciate the careful planning and thought you’ve put into ensuring this transaction can proceed smoothly and without attracting unwanted attention. I have taken a look at the information you provided for the investment bank in London, and it does sound like a safe and effective place for our needs. I will reach out to Mr. Rene Mathys as you advised to inquire about opening an offshore account capable of handling our transaction volume. I aim to establish contact today and will follow the script you’ve kindly provided to ensure all goes well. Your strategy to transfer the funds in a manner that avoids direct scrutiny and potential legal complications is genius. It’s clear to me now why routing the money through the investment bank first is a crucial step—ensuring there are no loose ends that might unravel our carefully laid plans. The idea of letting the funds sit for a week before beginning the transfer in smaller increments is also prudent; it adds an extra layer of discretion that I hadn’t considered. I share your caution regarding the direct transfer of funds to our personal accounts, understanding now the risks involved with that approach. Your foresight in avoiding such pitfalls reaffirms my confidence in our partnership and the success of this endeavor. I will proceed as instructed and contact the investment bank right away. Once I have any news or require further assistance, I'll reach out to you immediately. I assume after setting up the account and transferring the funds, we would need to have a detailed plan for the eventual movement of the funds into our personal accounts. I look forward to discussing this with you further. Rest assured, I am fully committed to our agreement and am eagerly taking the next steps to ensure our success. I’ll ensure that all communications and information exchanges are conducted securely, prioritizing our privacy and the integrity of the transaction above all. Thank you once again for entrusting me with this critical role in our partnership. I will make the necessary preparations and update you on my progress.

All I need from you is assurance that the fund when received by you will be used for the said purpose. You may ask why I don't want to transfer the fund directly to a charity account? My answer is no because I had a bad experience in the past at one of the motherless babies homes where I was betrayed by one of them after he received funds.

The early morning sun cast a radiant glow over the marina, illuminating the vast array of vessels tethered gently to the docks. Among these was the *Cerulean Odyssey*, a sleek, 40-foot sailboat that had been Marla's home and sanctuary for the past three years. But today, the vessel symbolized something far more significant than mere shelter or mode of travel; it epitomized the crossroads at which she now stood. Marla's gaze lingered on the *Odyssey*, her mind replaying countless memories etched into every inch of the boat. It was here she had found solace following the tumult of her previous life, here that she had learned the true meaning of resilience and independence. The sea had been both her teacher and her trial, offering lessons that she'd carry in her heart forever. However, the offer presented to her by the enigmatic Mr. Leeds poised a question that rattled the very core of her convictions. Through his global environmental initiative, he saw in Marla a key asset, someone who could spearhead a groundbreaking project that aimed to revolutionize the way humanity interacted with the oceans. The opportunity was the kind many would leap at without a second thought, but it demanded something Marla held sacred – the *Cerulean Odyssey*. To take the position meant to sell her beloved vessel, to relinquish her life of solitary exploration for a role anchored firmly to land, amidst teams, responsibilities, and a scope of influence that was both exhilarating and terrifying. As Marla's palms grazed the smooth wood of the wheel, a heavy heart weighed down her chest. It wasn't just about giving up the boat; it was the fear of losing herself, the person she'd become through trials, triumphs, and solitude. Yet, another part of her, a whispering voice borne from the same adventurous spirit that had led her to the sea, spoke of change, growth, and the untold stories waiting on the horizon of this second chance. The crisp morning breeze tangled through her hair as she turned to face the rising sun, a symbolic gesture as much as a moment of clarity. The same vessel had carried her this far, but it was the journey, not the vessel, that had shaped her. Was she willing to step off this familiar deck for a second chance, a different kind of adventure that could perhaps change not just her own course but also set a new direction for the world? A soft, almost imperceptible smile graced her lips as the answer rose from the depths of her soul, clear and unwavering. Marla had never been one to shy away from the call of the unknown, and this was no time to start. The *Cerulean Odyssey* had been her cocoon, but now it was time to emerge, to spread wings she hadn't realized she'd grown. Turning back towards the dock, her steps steady and resolute, Marla whispered a gratitude-filled farewell to the *Odyssey* and embraced the dawn of her second chance. Each step away from the boat and towards the new path ahead was filled with a potent mix of nostalgia and anticipation. This was not an end, but a transformation, a renaissance of spirit and purpose. In that moment, Marla realized that sometimes, the greatest adventures await not at sea, but in the hearts and minds of those daring enough to change course."},{"prompt":"write chapter seventeen a book on christian spiritual warfare based on the following: THE SAME VESSEL OR THE SECOND CHANCE","completion":"Chapter Seventeen: The Same Vessel or The Second Chance The dawn of realization came quietly to Elijah, much like the first rays of light that sneak past the curtain's edge to whisper the arrival of a new day. He sat in the modest, yet warmly lit study of his cottage, a place that had become his refuge, his war room of sorts, where battles invisible to the naked eye were routinely fought and won. The walls, lined with books that ranged from ancient texts to contemporary works on spiritual warfare, seemed to watch over him, a silent testament to the journey that had led him to this very moment. For years, Elijah had navigated the treacherous waters of spiritual warfare within the confines of what he had always known, the same vessel that had carried him through countless storms and victories. It was a place of comfort, a well-worn groove in which his soul had settled, sure and steadfast in its course. Yet, the conviction that dawned on him this morning was a wind of change, a divine whisper that suggested the time had come to consider a second chance—to step out of the vessel that had served him well but perhaps had grown too familiar, limiting the vastness of what God intended for his journey. As he pondered this, Elijah's gaze landed upon a well-thumbed Bible, its pages brimming with notes and reflections. Herein lay the stories of countless individuals who faced similar crossroads, moments where faith was the only compass that could guide them into the unknown. He reflected on how God often called His people to leave the familiar behind, to trust in His promise of renewal and transformation. Was this his moment? Was the Lord calling him to embark on a new path that would require leaving the comfort of his vessel for a second chance at deeper, more profound engagement in spiritual warfare? The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying. Elijah's heart raced as he considered the implications. It meant venturing into uncharted territory, engaging with challenges and adversaries he had yet to encounter. More than ever, he would need to clothe himself in the full armor of God, as outlined in Ephesians 6, embracing truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and the Word of God as his defense. The battle would be fierce, the trials perhaps more severe, but the opportunity to grow in faith and effectiveness in spiritual warfare was a call too compelling to ignore. With a prayerful heart, Elijah stood, feeling a surge of determination lift his spirit. This was no mere whimsical change of direction but a divine reassignment, an opportunity bestowed by grace for a second chance to serve in the Lord's army at a new capacity. The same God who calmed the sea could surely guide him through this transition, leading him to victories greater than he had ever known. As he closed his eyes and prayed, Elijah offered his fears, his hopes, and his will to God. He sought not just the strength to leave the comfort of his familiar vessel but also the courage to step into a second chance with unwavering faith. He knew the road ahead would not be easy, but he also knew who walked beside him, the unchanging God who gives new mercies every morning, the One who calls each of us to trust Him, sometimes by staying in the same vessel, and other times, by embracing a second chance. With his heart anchored in the promise of God's faithfulness, Elijah prepared to embark on this new chapter, reminded that in the kingdom's spiritual warfare, the true victory lies not in the vessel, but in the unyielding reliance on, and allegiance to, the One who commands the seas and holds the map to our destiny."},{"prompt":"write chapter seventeen a book on christian spiritual warfare based on the following: SECOND CHANCE use relevant scripture references","completion":"Chapter Seventeen: Second Chance As dawn broke, casting a warm, golden hue over the horizon, Thomas found himself kneeling in his small, yet fervently dedicated prayer room, a space he reserved for moments of deep communion with God. The battle he faced, a relentless struggle against unseen spiritual forces, had left him feeling weary and defeated. Yet, it was in this moment of utter vulnerability that he sensed God stirring something profound within him—a message of renewal and hope: a second chance. Thomas was reminded of Jonah, the prophet who initially fled from God's call, only to be given a second chance to fulfill his divine mission (Jonah 3:1-2). Like Jonah, Thomas realized that God's grace was not exhausted by his failings; indeed, the Lord's mercies are new every morning, a testament to His unfailing love and faithfulness (Lamentations 3:22-23). Clutching his well-worn Bible, Thomas turned to the story of Peter, a disciple who, despite his bold declaration of loyalty, denied Jesus three times. Yet, in the poignant post-resurrection scene by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus restored Peter, asking him three times if he loved Him, paralleling Peter’s three denials. Each affirmation of love was a step toward his restoration, culminating in Jesus' commission: \\"Feed my sheep\\" (John 21:15-17). Peter was given a second chance, not only to reaffirm his devotion but to step into a pivotal role in the early Church. This biblical pattern of redemption and renewal underscored a fundamental truth: God specializes in second chances. He takes our failures, our brokenness, and our regrets and weaves them into His greater plan for good, inviting us to rise from our falls and engage once more in the spiritual battles that mark our journey (Romans 8:28). Empowered by these reflections, Thomas understood that his defeat was not the end but rather a turning point. The spiritual warfare he engaged in was as much about resisting the enemy's advances as it was about submitting to God's refining process, allowing Him to mold and strengthen his character through trials (James 4:7). With renewed vigor, Thomas stood, lifting his hands in surrender and worship. He recited Ephesians 6:10-18, the passage on the armor of God, with a deepened understanding of its significance. The belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit were not merely defensive tools, but symbols of a life wholly surrendered to, and empowered by, God. As Thomas committed to embarking on this second chance, he held onto the promise that God is the God of new beginnings, one who delights in restoring and using those who come to Him with a contrite heart (Psalm 51:17). The spiritual warfare ahead would indeed be challenging, but with God’s strength and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, victory was assured. In the stillness of the morning, Thomas found himself enveloped in peace, a reassurance that, in God's kingdom, every second chance is an opportunity not just for personal restoration, but for the advancement of God’s sovereign, redemptive plan. And so, with a heart full of gratitude, he stepped into the day, committed to fighting the good fight of faith, clothed in the full armor of God, and secure in the knowledge that in Christ, he was more than a conqueror (Romans 8:37). Chapter Seventeen thus closes on a note of hope and redemption, a testament to God's boundless grace and the transformative power of second chances in the lives of those who are called according to His purpose."},{"prompt":"biblical basis of a second chance","completion":"The concept of second chances is deeply woven into the fabric of Scripture, reflecting the heart of God who is rich in mercy, abounding in love, and willing to forgive and restore those who turn to Him. The Bible is replete with stories of individuals and communities who received a second chance at life, at faith, and at fulfilling their God-given destiny. Here, we explore some key biblical passages and narratives that elucidate the theological basis for second chances: 1. **The Story of Jonah** (Book of Jonah): Jonah's experience is one of the most vivid examples of a second chance in the Bible. Initially, Jonah runs away from God's command to go and preach repentance to the city of Nineveh. After being swallowed by a great fish and spending three days and nights in its belly, Jonah is given a second chance. God commands the fish to vomit Jonah onto dry land, and the word of the Lord comes to Jonah a second time, giving him another opportunity to obey God's directive (Jonah 3:1-3). Jonah's story illustrates God's willingness to give second chances not only to Jonah but also to the people of Nineveh, who repented and were spared. 2. **Peter's Denial and Restoration** (Luke 22:54-62; John 21:15-19): Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, denied knowing Jesus three times before the rooster crowed, just as Jesus had predicted. However, after the resurrection, Jesus gave Peter a chance to affirm his love three times, mirroring the three denials. This restoration signified Peter's second chance, demonstrating that failure is not final with God. Peter went on to become a foundational leader in the early Church. 3. **The Parable of the Prodigal Son** (Luke 15:11-32): This parable, told by Jesus, is a powerful depiction of God's grace and the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents. The younger son squanders his inheritance in reckless living but decides to return to his father, prepared to beg for mercy and work as a servant. Instead, the father receives him with open arms, celebrating his return. This story illustrates the second chance given through repentance and the loving, forgiving nature of God the Father toward those who turn back to Him. 4. **David's Sin and Repentance** (2 Samuel 12; Psalm 51): After committing adultery with Bathsheba and arranging the death of her husband, Uriah, David was confronted by the prophet Nathan. David repented deeply for his sins, and though there were consequences, God forgave him and continued to use David in His purposes. David's psalms of repentance, especially Psalm 51, show the heart of someone who has received a second chance through God's mercy. 5. **Jesus and the Woman Caught in Adultery** (John 8:1-11): When the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery to Jesus, expecting Him to condemn her, He responded with grace, saying, \\"Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\\" After her accusers left, Jesus told the woman, \\"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.\\" This encounter underscores Jesus' authority to forgive sins and His desire to offer a second chance to those caught in sin, encouraging them to live a transformed life. These biblical narratives and others illustrate that second chances are a hallmark of God's character. He is a God of new beginnings, offering forgiveness and restoration to all who turn to Him with a repentant heart (1 John 1:9). The message of second chances speaks to the inclusivity of God's love, His desire for relationship with humanity, and His sovereign plan of redemption that makes all things new (Revelation 21:5)."},{"prompt":"write chapter Seventeen: SAME VESSEL, SECOND CHANCE applied to spiritual warfare based on the following ;The concept of second chances is deeply woven into the fabric of Scripture, reflecting the heart of God who is rich in mercy, abounding in love, and willing to forgive and restore those who turn to Him.

Ephesians 6:12 reminds us of the nature of our struggle: \\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\\" In this battle, our missteps can feel amplified, causing despair. Yet, the stories of Jonah, Peter, the prodigal son, David, and the woman caught in adultery reveal a profound truth: our setbacks can become setups for God's grace to manifest, offering us a second chance to stand firm and fight the good fight of faith. **Jonah's Second Chance: The Call to Obedience and Repentance** Jonah's story, more than an astonishing account of survival, symbolizes the second chance for obedience and repentance God extends to us. When Jonah chose to flee rather than face Nineveh, it wasn't just a physical departure but a spiritual evasion of God's call. Many believers find themselves in similar situations, avoiding God's commands out of fear, inadequacy, or rebellion. Yet, Jonah's eventual decision to obey after being given a second chance demonstrates that it's never too late to return to God's path. The spiritual warfare lesson here is clear: obedience and repentance are crucial armor pieces in our battle against evil. **Peter's Restoration: Failure is Not Final with God** Peter's denial of Jesus represents one of the most poignant moments of personal failure in Scripture. Yet, Jesus' restoration of Peter underscores the truth that our mistakes are not the end of our story. Believers might falter under pressure or in moments of weakness, yet Jesus' question to Peter, \\"Do you love me?\\" echoes through time, reminding us that our love and dedication to Christ can renew our purpose and mission, even in the aftermath of failure. In spiritual warfare, this story encourages us to press on, knowing that our identity in Christ is secure, not based on our perfection but on His grace. **The Prodigal Son: Embraced by Grace** The parable of the prodigal son showcases the heart of the Father towards sinners—the heart of a God who eagerly awaits our return, no matter how far we've strayed. In the context of spiritual warfare, this narrative offers comfort and motivation. It illustrates that returning to the Father with a repentant heart moves us from a position of vulnerability to the enemy, back into the safety of God's love and protection. Our second chance doesn't come from our merit but from His boundless grace. **David's Repentance: The Beauty of Brokenness** David's sincere repentance after his grave sins with Bathsheba demonstrates that no one is beyond God's reach for restoration. Psalm 51, a beautiful prayer of repentance, serves as a model for believers engaging in spiritual warfare. It teaches us that acknowledging our brokenness and seeking God's cleansing makes room for spiritual renewal and protection. **The Woman Caught in Adultery: No Condemnation in Christ** Lastly, the story of the woman caught in adultery illuminates Jesus' authority to forgive sins and free us from condemnation. As believers, this narrative reassures us that accusations and guilt from the enemy cannot stand against the word and grace of Jesus. In spiritual warfare, understanding that \\"there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\\" (Romans 8:1) is pivotal in maintaining our standing and confidence in battle. In summary, Chapter Seventeen brings to light the profound message of second chances as a cornerstone of our strategy in spiritual warfare. Through the grace of God, evident in these biblical narratives, we are reminded that our battles are fought with the understanding that our Commander-in-Chief champions mercy, redemption, and restoration. This, in itself, is a powerful assurance that empowers us to face the spiritual forces of evil with hope, resilience, and the certainty of victory in Christ."},{"prompt":"Write chapter eighteen based on the following: HOPE FOR THE FUTURE","completion":"Chapter Eighteen: Hope for the Future As dawn broke, casting a soft, golden light over the horizon, Samuel found himself on the precipice of a new day—a symbolic reflection of the journey he had undertaken in the realm of spiritual warfare. His path had been strewn with trials and moments of doubt, but also with profound instances of grace and redemption. Through it all, one constant remained: the beacon of hope that illuminated his path, guiding him forward into the future. Armed with the lessons of the past, including the significance of second chances, Samuel recognized that the battles he faced were not just for today but were preparing him for the days to come. The Scriptures brimmed with promises of hope and a future, promises that were not just ancient words but living, breathing reassurances for believers engaged in spiritual battles. \\"‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.’\\" (Jeremiah 29:11). This verse had become a cornerstone for Samuel, a divine whisper that amidst the chaos of warfare, God’s plans for him were for good, not for despair. It served as a reminder that the ultimate victory was already secured, a beacon of hope in the darkest of times. Moreover, the story of Joseph, who persevered through betrayal, false accusations, and imprisonment, only to be elevated to a position of influence and power, served as a testament to the fact that God's plans can manifest in the most unexpected ways (Genesis 50:20). Joseph's story was not just about enduring hardship but about witnessing God's faithfulness transform pain and suffering into a purposeful future. As Samuel continued his journey, he held onto the truth found in Romans 8:28, \\"And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\\" This verse was a powerful declaration that in every moment of spiritual warfare, God was working things out for his benefit. It was an assurance that the battle was not just about the present struggle but about shaping a future filled with hope and promise. But hope for the future was not only about personal peace or prosperity; it was deeply intertwined with the mission to which all believers are called—the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20). Samuel realized that his experiences in spiritual warfare were equipping him with the empathy, wisdom, and spiritual authority needed to lead others to Christ. The hope he possessed was not just for his own future but was a light meant to guide others out of darkness. In choosing to focus on the hope of the future, Samuel discovered that the challenges and trials of spiritual warfare were not merely obstacles but opportunities to grow in faith, love, and anticipation of the things God had promised. This perspective shift did not negate the reality of the battle but infused it with purpose and direction. As Chapter Eighteen draws to a close, Samuel's story stands as a beacon to all who navigate the tumultuous waters of spiritual warfare. It is a reminder that the hope for the future we possess as believers is not a fleeting sentiment but a robust, living hope anchored in the promises of God. It is this hope that sustains us, propels us forward, and lights up the path, turning our battles into victories and our sorrows into joy. Hope for the future is not just a distant dream but a tangible reality for those who place their trust in God, for He is already there, preparing the way, securing our steps, and calling us into a future brimming with His unending grace."},{"prompt":"biblical basis of HOPE FOR THE FUTURE","completion":"The biblical concept of hope for the future is deeply ingrained in the Judeo-Christian narrative, providing believers with assurance, comfort, and motivation amidst the trials and tribulations of life. This hope is not a mere wishful thinking but a steadfast confidence rooted in the promises of God and the eventual fulfillment of His redemptive plan for humanity. Let’s explore some key Scriptures that offer a firm foundation for understanding this hope. 1. **Jeremiah 29:11**: \\"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.\\" This well-known verse is a declaration from God to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon. It highlights that God has sovereign plans for His people, plans designed for their good that ultimately lead to a future filled with hope. 2. **Romans 8:28**: \\"And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\\" This verse underscores the belief that God is actively working in all circumstances for the benefit of those who love Him. It provides believers with the assurance that, irrespective of present challenges, there is a divine purpose being fulfilled that will lead to their good and God’s glory. 3. **Romans 15:13**: \\"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.\\" This blessing highlights God as the source of hope, and it connects the experience of joy and peace with the act of believing in Him. It acknowledges the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to possess an abundance of hope. 4. **Hebrews 11:1**: \\"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.\\" This definition of faith is intimately connected with hope. It describes hope as an assured expectation for the future, which believers hold onto not because they see it, but because their faith in God’s promises gives them conviction of its reality. 5. **Revelation 21:4**: “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” This verse points to the future hope of a new creation where all the sorrow and pain of this world will be eradicated. It encapsulates the ultimate hope for believers: eternal life with God in a restored world free from sin and its effects. 6. **Isaiah 40:31**: \\"But they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.\\" Here, hope is portrayed as waiting on the Lord, which results in renewed strength. This metaphorical language conveys the idea that hope in God empowers believers to face life’s challenges with endurance and resilience. 7. **Philippians 1:6**: \\"And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\\" Paul expresses confidence that God, who initiated the believers’ journey of faith, will faithfully bring it to fruition. This provides hope that God’s transformative work in a believer's life is ongoing and will be completed in the future. These Scriptures collectively articulate a robust theology of hope for the future, anchored in God's character, promises, and redemptive plan. Hope, from a biblical standpoint, is more than optimism about what is to come; it is a certainty based on the trustworthy nature of God, who has demonstrated His faithfulness throughout history and has promised an ultimate, glorious future for those who place their trust in Him."},{"prompt":"apply these to spiritual warfare","completion":"Applying the Biblical Basis of Hope for the Future to Spiritual Warfare In the context of spiritual warfare, the biblical concept of hope is not just an auxiliary comfort; it is a critical component of the believer's arsenal. Understanding and embracing the hope Scripture offers can empower believers to stand firm against spiritual forces of evil, enduring trials with perseverance and confidence in God's ultimate victory. Let’s explore how these biblical truths about hope can be applied in the midst of spiritual battles. # Jeremiah 29:11 - Trusting in God's Providential Plans In spiritual warfare, it’s essential to trust that God has a plan for our welfare, a plan to give us a future filled with hope. This understanding can help believers endure difficult seasons, knowing that their battles are part of a larger narrative God is weaving, one that is ultimately for their good and His glory. Trusting in God's providential plans means believing that even the attacks from the enemy can be used by God to fulfill His purposes in our lives. # Romans 8:28 - Confidence in Divine Purpose The assurance that God works all things together for good for those who love Him is a powerful truth in spiritual warfare. It means that no matter how fierce the battle, the outcome belongs to God, and it will contribute to our growth and His kingdom's advancement. This confidence allows believers to face spiritual opposition with hope, knowing that victory is assured in God’s overarching purpose. # Romans 15:13 - The Power of the Holy Spirit Hope is not a human-derived emotion but a gift from the God of hope, nurtured within us by the Holy Spirit. In moments of spiritual warfare, when despair or discouragement threatens to overwhelm, believers can draw on the Holy Spirit's power to replenish their joy and peace, abounding in hope amidst adversity. It is this supernatural hope that sustains the believer through all trials. # Hebrews 11:1 - Faith in the Unseen Future Spiritual warfare requires faith in what is not seen—the final victory, the fulfillment of God’s promises, and our future inheritance. Hebrews 11:1 teaches that hope is the assurance of these unseen realities. Clinging to this hope equips believers to persevere in battle, fighting not for immediate outcomes but for the eternal weight of glory that lies ahead. # Revelation 21:4 - The Hope of Restoration In the heat of spiritual conflict, the promise of a new creation where pain, mourning, and death are no more offers profound hope. This eschatological vision can inspire believers to endure, knowing that their struggle against evil contributes to the ushering in of God's eternal kingdom where peace reigns forever. The hope of restoration empowers believers to fight against darkness with the light of future joy in their hearts. # Isaiah 40:31 - Renewed Strength for the Battle Waiting on the Lord in times of spiritual warfare ensures the renewal of our strength. Hope enables us to “mount up with wings like eagles,” to run without growing weary, to walk without fainting (Isaiah 40:31). This promise is essential for spiritual warriors who may feel depleted. It assures us that hope in God brings supernatural endurance and vitality, enabling us to continue the fight. # Philippians 1:6 - Faith in the Ultimate Triumph Believers engaged in spiritual warfare can be encouraged by the assurance that God will complete the good work He began in them. This includes victory over sin and darkness, both in their lives and in the world. Such hope ensures that even when battles rage, we can look forward to the day when Christ returns, and His ultimate triumph over evil is manifested. Applying these Scriptures in spiritual warfare means grounding our combat strategy not in temporal circumstances but in the eternal, unshakeable hope we have in Christ. Armed with this hope, believers can face spiritual adversaries with courage, stand firm in the faith, and advance confidently, knowing that the future victory in Christ is assured."},{"prompt":"rewrite the following introduction in simple down to earth language: Introduction In the vast expanse of our world, where continents stretch like patchwork quilts beneath the endless sky, and in the boundless reaches of the universe, where stars twinkle like ancient beacons in the velvet night, a timeless battle rages incessantly. It is a battle between the forces of darkness and light, where shadows dance with flickering flames, where fear clashes with courage, and where despair wages war against hope. Amidst this grand cosmic tapestry, amidst the swirling galaxies and the silent voids between, there emerge two profound entities: \\"The Enemy of the Night\\" and \\"The Power of the Star.\\" These are not mere abstract concepts; they are living embodiments of primal energies, cosmic archetypes that have guided humanity since time immemorial. They stand as guardians of the eternal struggle, offering not just intellectual comprehension but a tangible vessel—a sturdy ship amidst tempestuous seas—through which weary souls may navigate the tumultuous waters of spiritual warfare and personal metamorphosis. \\"The Enemy of the Night\\" lurks in the deepest shadows, a malevolent force that seeks to engulf all in its suffocating embrace. It whispers seductive lies and sows seeds of doubt, casting veils of darkness over the hearts and minds of mortals. Yet, in opposition to this sinister entity, there shines forth \\"The Power of the Star.\\" Like a celestial beacon, it radiates with the brilliance of a thousand suns, illuminating the path of righteousness and dispelling the shadows of doubt and fear. It is the source of all that is good and true, the eternal flame that ignites the spark of hope within the human spirit. Together, these opposing forces form the bedrock of existence, the yin and yang of the cosmic dance.

The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is.

The Nyarlathotep H.P Lovecraft wrote about was [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] indeed [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] a real person [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] and the current heiress of das Königshaus von Einzbern at that time [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works], but [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] just choose to portray herself [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] as an eldritch being to him [H.P Lovecraft] because she [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] thought [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] it was funny. Due to the status of containing a copy of the wish-granting artifact known as the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and thus having very strong transmutation [creation and forging of matter |transmutation|] magic and alchemic abilities, along with potent healing magic and the knowledge required both to use the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and their natural powers, along with the ability to use and operate the potent technologies being used by the Nyarlotephians [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore!

The heiresses of das Königshaus von Einzbern also receive the title of \\"Al Azif\\", the physical manifestation [\\"Al-Azif\\"] of the Necronomicon in the minds of those fighting against the occult and/or seeking to expose the occult's control over the non-magical world to those who are unaware of the Clocktower's [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] existence or the existence of the rest of the moonlit world. Back in the 20th century, the apocalyptic event caused by Antarctica being struck by a large asteroid known as Second Impact happened at the end of a late 1980s-early 1990s hot war turned nuclear, between the USSR and USA instead of in 2001 like in the canon NGE. Wukong, forced to survive on the streets and fighting off both organized crime groups, terror organizations, the Soviet and American intelligence communities and secret societies interested in his [Wukong's] power and [Wukong] now living under multiple aliases, [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually [Wukong] captured on and [Wukong] experimented on by the paramilitary secret society/survivalist club/social darwinistic organization that promotes the merger of all humanity into one, SEELE [NGE], [Wukong] eventually escaping but [Wukong] becoming disillusioned with human society as he [Wukong] witnesses the rise of the superhuman abilities known as Quirks and the reemergence of non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [Wukong] developing a second personality that [Wukong's second personality] eventually becomes the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possessive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia]. In the alternate 20th century of this story before Second Impact, Japan continued on its [Japan's] growth towards becoming a economic, industrial and cultural superpower [Japan] in Asia from the 1950s to the late 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" of OTL/real life, the PRC in mainland China disintergrated from the chaos of, surrounding and after Second Impact with Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan and Tibet becoming independent from Han China after Second Impact. Descendants of the horned humanoid extraterrestrial creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke, [descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan] which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan] left the hidden from the rest of the world, semi-feudal with superpowers beyond human imagination sub continent of the Elemental Nations [Naruto] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan] losing its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] position of the imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan] and gods [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in all but name of the Elemental Nations sometime after the fight between the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's sub-clan of the Uchiha clan [Naruto franchise] Madara [Naruto franchise] and his [Madara's] rival for power over the Land of Fire in the Elemental Nations, the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's other side branch of the Senju, Hashirama [Naruto franchise], [the Ōtsutsuki clan leaving the Elemental Nations after Hashirama's and Madara's battle for control over the Land of Fire] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently ended up in feudal Japan, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently marrying into both the diclonii and the Japanese aristocracy and nobility, [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan after Second Impact] use the chaos of Second Impact to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] launch a coup against the crumbling Japanese government and [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] subsequently used the Land of the Rising Sun's [Japan's] technological, military and economical resources to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] conquer their [the descendants' of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] homeland [the Elemental Nations], which [the coup launched against the Japanese government by descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] fails somewhat due to the Ōtsutsuki clan being mistaken as the surviving members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato that have regained their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] divine powers gained from the Shinto Gods, with the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan not bothering to correct the mistake, although the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan do succeed in taking control of both the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa. Japan's government also devolves into a somewhat modernized combination of the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan mistaken for the Imperial House of Great Yamato in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored to their pre-1868 position as Japanese Shoguns. The buke [military families |buke|], better known as samurai of the feudal shogunate-dominated era of Japanese history, [the buke] make a return along with the pre-1947 Japanese aristocracy, even though the pre-1947 Japanese military is also restored as well. Japan then subsequently reclaims the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan, Sahlakin Island and the Kurils in the years after Second Impact, restoring the territorial integrity of Imperial Japan in an event comparable to the formation of the German Empire by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1871. The mass emergence of Quirks due to the after-effects of Second Impact, along with the emergence of Diva [another word |Diva| for |what a Diva is also called| a contracted spirit which |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| is |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ is| manifestation of a creature, a concept, or a character from some mythology or folk belief |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| that |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ does| forms |what a Diva forms| a contract with |the human or supernatural entity a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ forms a contract with| a chosen human or supernatural creature, |the human or supernatural creature a ‘Diva’/contracted spirit forms a contract with| usually being a female between the ages of 13-29 |the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature| being represented by |what the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is represented by| a mark known as |what the mark that represents the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is known as| a Stigima that |the Stigma| usually |the Stigma| is |what normally happens to a Stigma| on the contractor’s right hand, |the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature being known as a Stigma| and |what else the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature does apart from the contractor recieving a stigma| giving the contractor |what the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| the ability to |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| materliaize and use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux |Oblique Neckline/Magical Dress/“Cleavage required” (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux), a special set of armor (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) that (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) most of the time resembles (what a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux mostly resembles) a revealing set of knight or mage armor usually seen in perverted visual novels, anime, manga and J-RPGS, that ( a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) can (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only be used by (who are the only persons who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) female humans and supernatural creatures that (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) have (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) formed contracts with (what supernatural entity the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux have formed contracts with) contracted spirits/‘Divas’, that (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only appears (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) when (the time when a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux appears and can be used) the contractor is in battle or (the contractor) otherwise using more than a small percentage of the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s power| as well as |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with apart from receiving a Stigma and gaining the ability to use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux| the ability to use the the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s she has formed a contract with’s magic, |Divas| from |the media franchise Divas are (Divas) from| Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [the emergence of Quirk users, Diva contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology] necessitates the quick restoration and subsequent implementation of the then prototype pre-Second Impact Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system of national qualification which [the Armed Detective system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Armed Detective to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Armed Detectives] have an Armed Detective license, all across the imperial Japanese shogunate. Post Second Impact, post-CCP, Post-PRC Han China itself restores the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-governed Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled [the restored Empire of China ruling over Han China] by the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as its [the restored Empire of China's] imperial family after a covertly Japanese-backed \\"revolution\\" topples the rump PRC. This restored Great Ming State still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's Twelve Symbols national emblem and [the Beiyang Government's] national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", [the restored Great Ming State] flies a modified the Beiyang Government's \\"Five colored flag\\" which [the five colored flag] is [the five coloured flag] is [the five colored flag] a banner Five horizontal bands of red, yellow, blue, white and black with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol in the middle as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. Yuan Shikai, Sun-Yat-Sen's intended heir Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong are [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] considered to be the people [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] who [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] laid the foundation for the restoration of the Ming in China. The formerly KMT-ruled Nationalist China, formerly [Nationalist China] in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1947, [Nationalist China] manages to take Southern China [Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan] but [Nationalist China] quickly becomes an independent Cantonian republic in all but name. Nationalist China eventually becomes known as the Republic of Cantonia or just Cantonia. Yunnan becomes independent from both Han China and the Nationalist China on Cantonia and [Yunnan] restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government. The pre-WW2 and WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo is restored in post-CCP, PRC, post-Soviet Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and the WW2-era Japanese protectorate Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation is [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] restored [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] in post-CCP, post-PRC Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions and [Mengjiang and Manchukuo] subsequently return to [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] being Japanese protectorates. The restored Great Ming State is [the restored Great Ming State] a Japanese protectorate [the restored Great Ming State] akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China as the WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China. The lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] restored [the Kingdom of Tibet] in Tibet. Japan also restores the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos in Laos and the House of Kobang-ruled Third Burmese Empire in Myanmar. Japan also restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. Both the restored Great Ming State and the restored Manchukuo practice the Beiyang Government's foremost concept of \\"Five Races under One Union\\". The imperial Japanese shogunate is able to spread the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] to all of the nations in Indochina and the China region. Meanwhile in Europe, Germany uses the chaos of the Second Impact to [Germany] regain the Prussian and Czetch territories it [Germany] had lost after WW2. The German House of Hohenzollern-lead Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire returns to power in Germany which [Germany] essentially dominates Europe through the EU after Second Impact. Austria absorbs Czechoslovakia and Hungary into itself to [Austria] reform the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire once more and [Austria] reclaims Transylvania, Banat, Carpathian Ruthenia and South Tyrol, [Austria] then defeating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and [Austria] annexing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. Austria also joins the EU, which [the EU] has [the EU] become a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic WW1-era Mittleeuropa project and NATO, which [NATO] has effectively become a modern day restoration of the Central Powers. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restored German Empire] restoring the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. European Russia is under the rule of a restored Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire which [the restored Russian Empire] is [the restored Russian Empire] an EU member, the rest of post-Second Impact, post-Soviet Russia is under the rule of warlords fighting for power. What is left of civilization in America is divided between a theocratic Charismatic evangelical and Trotskyist neoconservative coalition dominated Republican Party-controlled USA in what remains of the USA in the Northern American states and a neo-Confederacy ruled by the white supremacist, warmongering Anglophile Blue Dog Democrats and the KKK in the South, with the West Coast States being controlled by Japan, New England being owned by Canada and the original thirteen states of the USA being a EU protectorate. Europe and East Asia both restructure the UN into an entity resembling a modernized, worldwide version of the Congress of Vienna, with the Europeans also implementing the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] as well. The regions of the USA and the former USSR that were affected by the nuclear holocaust and Second Impact but were too remote to be reached or had collapsed from the aftermath of the post-WW2 civilization's end became known as \\"the Deathlands\\". The form of civilization that has begun to reappear in these places [\\"the deathlands\\"] is brutal, short lived, morally confused, and crazed from mutation, mostly being small plague pits ruled by warlords who [the warlords ruling the plague pits] have no limits to establish their [the warlords'] rule and [the warlords'] expand their influence, [the warlords] being [the warlords] known as the Barons [Deathlands]. Their [the Barons'] rabble pits are [the Barons' rabble pits] known as [what the Barons' rabble pits are called] villes and baronies. The Hidden Villages [Naruto franchise] of chakra [Naruto franchise] using fake shinobi are [the Hidden Villages in this story] merely [the Hidden Villages in this story] a more developed form of villes and baronies with the Kage of each Hidden Village acting as a combination of Town Mayor and Baron. The Hidden Cloud Village is hidden within Germany, the Hidden Rain Village is located within the ruins of NYC, the Hidden Leaf Village is located in Sacramento and the Greater Era, the Land of Tea is the general name given to Southeast Asia by fake shinobi, the Hidden Mist Village is located within Han China, the Hidden Sand Village is located in Riyadah and the Land of Samurai is the name given to Japan by fake shinobi. Neither the wider world nor the rest of the villes or baronies have any idea the Hidden Villages actually exist. During the Cold War both the USSR and the USA developed hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that [the redoubts] contain teleportation technology known as MAT-TRANS [Matter Transfer]. Returning to Wukong for a bit, he [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually able to [Wukong] regain himself [Wukong] and [Wukong] eventually absorb his [Wukong's] \\"Hiashi\\" persona back into himself [Wukong], [Wukong] gaining access to Hiashi's memories, powers, abilities and skills and even his [Hiashi's] Quirk, even though this [Hiashi becoming whole again] causes him [Wukong] to [Wukong] temporarily go insane, [Wukong] accidentally taking the identity of a then young corporate tycoon in the making with a secretly perverted and lecherous personality, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Hyōdō Gorou when the real Gorou is [the real Gorou] killed while [the real Gorou] searching for perverted manga and anime at a J-AV store. As Gorou, Wukong uses his [Gorou's] identity to [Gorou] build a legitimate identity while [Wukong] using Hiashi's skills, knowledge and abilities to keep his [Wukong's] finances in the clear. As Gorou, Wukong eventually marries Gorou's fiancee who [Gorou's fiancee] is [Gorou's fiancee] the current head [Gorou's fiancee] of the Tōno clan's most public side-branch, the partially Han Chinese family of martial artists and ex-samurai known as the Arima along with being the daughter [Gorou's fiancee] of the supposedly deceased in the eyes of the galaxy, but actually still alive and well on Earth but now elderly current Crown Prince of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], the tall, slender and muscular, wise and calm Masaki Yōshō Jurai [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], who [Yōshō] is [Yōshō] in hiding on Earth as the famed martial artist, swordsman and Shinto priest Masaki Katsuhito [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], in this fic, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, headstrong and steadfast, highly intelligent but secretly shy and soft spoken corporate executive Miki, who [Miki in this story] becomes [Miki in this story] a loving and kind, caring housewife upon the birth of their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] first child, a brown-haired, amber-eyed boy [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] who [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] inherits Wukong's battle-loving, hyperactive and somewhat careless Saiyan personality along with Vegeta's arrogant nature and a weak pyrokinesis quirk along with a sub-Quirk of \\"Gulity Crown\\", which [Guilty Crown] analyzes intron sequences in the human genome and [Guilty Crown] draws out the power hidden within a person by converting it into a manifestation of the targeted person's heart, [that manifestation] being [the manifestation] known as a Void along with the Saiyan bloodline from both Vegeta and Wukong and Miki's intelligence, street-smarts and weak yokai [monster |yokai|] and [Miki's] strong Juraiouke/Masaki Ouchou blood, [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] Issei who [Issei] has [what Issei has] the Seikuriddo Gia [Sacred Gear |Seikuriddo Gia|, an artefact | Seikuriddo Gia| with |what the Seikuriddo Gia has that makes it unique| powerful abilities |belonging to the Seikuriddo Gia| bestowed |upon the Seikuriddo Gia| upon it |the Seikuriddo Gia| by |the divinity that bestowed powerful abilites upon the Seikuriddo Gia| God as part of his |God's| system to |what God bestowed powerful abilities upon the Seikuriddo Gia to do| enact miracles |the Seikuriddo Gia| on Earth] Būsuteddo Gia, [Boosted Gear |Būsuteddo Gia|, a red gauntlet |Būsuteddo Gia| appearing like |what Būsuteddo Gia resembles| a dragon's front paw with a large emerald in the middle |of Būsuteddo Gia| which |Būsuteddo Gia| boosts its |Būsuteddo Gia's| user's ability whenever the |current| user |of Būsuteddo Gia| mentally or verbally requests so], which [Būsuteddo Gia] contains [what Būsuteddo Gia contains as befitting its status as a Seikuriddo Gia] the soul of [the creature whose soul is contained with the Būsuteddo Gia Issei wields] the Sekiryūtei [Red Dragon Emperor |Sekiryūtei|] Y Ddraig Goch, [Y Ddraig Goch] the Red Dragon [Y Ddraig Goch] of [what national mythology or religion Y Ddraig Goch belongs to] Welsh Mythology and [what Y Ddraig Goch is known as] the Red Dragon of Domination [Y Ddraig Goch's other alias |the Red Dragon of Domination|], although his [Issei's] parents [Wukong as Gorou and Miki] don't know this. Of course Miki has no idea who her [Miki's] husband [Gorou] really is and [Miki] doesn't question why their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] son [Issei] is [Issei] born [Issei] with a monkey tail, which [Issei's Saiyan tail] Wukong mind-controls a team of surgical into removing [Issei's monkey tail] when Issei is [Issei] around three, without Miki being aware of it. Ddraig, who [Ddraig] is [Ddraig] in fact [Ddraig] a horny, perverted, extremely lecherous female, [Ddraig] tries to telepathically contact her [Ddraig's] latest host [Issei], which [Ddraig's attempts at reaching out to Issei] make him [Issei] think he [Issei] is [Issei] mentally ill as he [Issei] grows up, although he [Issei] hides this from his [Issei's] parents [Wukong as Gorou and Miki]. Wukong as Gorou also takes the former heiress of Das Königshaus von Einzbern turned its [Das Königshaus von Einzbern's] current modern day head, the mature and responsible but also carefree and ditzy, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, white-haired and red-eyed Irisviel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya], [Wukong as Gorou taking Irisviel] as his [Wukong's as Gorou's] second wife [Irisivel] in all but name after [Wukong as Gorou] rescuing her [Irisivel] from her [Irisivel's] controlling, abusive family [Das Königshaus von Einzbern] while [Wukong as Gorou] on a trip to Germany with Miki and [Wukong as Gorou] subsequently taking her [Irisivel] back to Japan with him [Wukong as Gorou]. Wukong as Gorou and Irisivel then have two children when Issei is [Issei] three years old: Illyasivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] and her [Illyasivel's] younger fraternal twin sister, Chloe von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya]. Illya becomes a somewhat mentally unstable and cold-blooded but cheerful and outgoing, upbeat, friendly, playful, and mischievous individual [Illya] as she [Illya] grows, with Chloe becoming openly calm, nonchalant, devious, manipulative and very observant, brazen and unrestrained and also very lecherous and perverted but also secretly caring, sweet, timid and vulnerable individual as she [Chloe] grows. Chloe and Illya also inherit the Saiyan bloodline from Wukong as Gorou in this story. Illya and Chloe also share the same short, slender, and petite build as they [Illya and Chloe] grow, although they [Illya and Chloe] also both [Illya and Chloe] develop a curvy and buxom figure when they [Illya and Chloe] reach pre-teen age. Illya also [Illya] inherits the position and title of Nyarlathotep from Irisivel and Chloe also inherits the position and title of Necronomicon/\\"Al-Azif\\" from Irisivel. The two girls [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] of course aware of this and [Illya and Chloe] grow up seeing themselves [Illya and Chloe] as soldiers [Illya and Chloe] of love and justice. Miki gives birth to her [Miki's] and Gorou's as Wukong's second child a year later after Illya's and Chloe's birth: the short and petite, blonde-haired and amber-eyed, current princess of the yokai and magical side of Kyoto, calm, mature and responsible but also childish and obsessive half-human kitsune [fox |kitsune|] daiyokai [monster lord |daiyokai|] Kunō. When Issei is six years old, he [Issei] finds himself [Issei] in an car accident with his [Issei's] younger maternal cousin in this story, the black-haired, blue-eyed, cute and extremely beautiful, carefully raised with flawless etiquette and bearing, strict, prideful and strong-willed but also secretly very shy and reserved current heiress of the main branch Tōno clan, Tōno Akiha [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] who [Akiha in this story] is [Akiha in this story] two years younger than him [Issei in this story], [young Issei in this story after the accident] spending a good amount of time in the hospital in a coma as, unknown to him [Issei in this story] his [Issei's in this story's] Būsuteddo Gia awakens, [Issei's Boosted Gear] awakening as his [Issei's] body heals from the accident, along with the blood of the now-decimated ex-samurai clan and shinobi order turned demon hunting family having the assassination arts of the ability to attack extraordinarily quickly and the ability to move so quickly as to appear to teleport, moving like spiders to use walls and ceilings as their footholds, and using unpredictable movements to confuse the opponent in combat, developing a murderous impulse against non-humans that became genetic due to focusing on killing demons known as the Nanaya [ Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] in him [Issei in this story], which [Issei's Nanaya blood in this story] comes from his [Issei's in this story's] mother [Miki], causing him [Issei in this story] to [Issei in this story] awaken the ocular bloodline gained from his [Issei’s in this story's] Nanaya blood, the Chokushi no Magan [Magic Eyes of Direct Death |Chokushi no Magan|], which [the Chokushi no Magan] allows him [Issei in this story] to [Issei in this story] see the \\"lines\\" and \\"points\\" of living and inanimate things, but also the death even of space and existence itself, in other words seeing the fate of all things, seeing the future along with the weak points where everything is most easily broken and the imperfection in everything that will break down one day along with [the Chokushi no Magan] possessing the capabilities and abilities of regular eyes [young Issei's awakening of the Chokushi no Magan] causing him [young Issei] to [young Issei] nearly go insane after [young Issei] effortlessly destroying the items in his [young Issei’s] hospital room by simply touching the faultlines in them after [young Issei] awakening from his [young Issei's] coma, before [young Issei] receiving a pair of glasses that [the glasses] suppress his [young Issei's] ocular bloodline [the Chokushi no Magan] and [the glasses] allow him [young Issei] to [young Issei] see normally again from [who young Issei recieved the glasses from] a mysterious tall, red-haired, purple-eyed buxom young woman after [young Issei] escaping from the hospital room in fustration. Young Akiha in this story is [young Akiha in this story] kidnapped [young Akiha in this story] by [who kidnaps young Akiha in this story] agents of the now-centuries-old head of the Matou clan of magi, the aged, semi-immortal, deranged and decrypt Matou Zouken [Fate/Stay Night] and [young Akiha in this story] subsequently made into the Matou clan heiress [young Akiha in this story] via [how young Akiha became the Matou clan heiress] a blood adoption potion and [young Akiha in this story] having the [Matou] clan's Crest Worms [Fate/Stay Night] implanted within her [young Akiha], although she [young Akiha] is [young Akiha] quickly rescued by the Tōno clan's current personal servants, and the current maids of the Tōno house whom [the current maids of the Tōno house] Issei and Akiha in this story see as their [Isseii’s and Akiha’s in this story's] onee-san [older sister/s |onee-san|], the red-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also very buxom, bright and cheerful, very responsible, extremely intelligent and very maternal Fujou “Ako” Kohaku [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and her [Kohaku’s] younger twin who shares her [Kohaku’s] red hair and [Kohaku’s] physical build but [Kohaku’s younger twin] has blue eyes, the publicly stern but privately kind, loving and emotional, track star and accomplished kendoka [one who practices kendo |kendoka|] Fujou “Riko” Hisui [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], [Kohaku and Hisui] killing the worm man [Zouken] in the process and [young Akiha in this story] subsequently brought back to the massive expanse of the Tōno mansion by them [Kohaku and Hisui], although she [Akiha in this story] has immense psychological and mental trauma from this [both the car accident and the kidnapping by Zouken], [Akiha in this story] developing a bad habit of [Akiha's in this story's bad habit] wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha in this story] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha's in this story's] older twin sister in this story, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name Tōsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen's] and Akiha's by now long deceased shared biological mother who [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] was [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] a member [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] of [the group Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother belonged to] the immensely wealthy and influential both in the magical and non-magical worlds, Tōsaka clan [Fate/Stay Night] when she [Karen/Rin] returns from the premier magical institution in the world, the London-based Clocktower [Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin's/Rin's] family [the Tōnos]. Due to the death of Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother's husband and thus Karen's and Akiha's shared biological father the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, brown-haired and blue-eyed calm and soft-spoken Tōno Makihisa [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], in the accident both girls [Karen and Akiha] are [Karen and Akiha] left parentless [Karen and Akiha] and so Gorou and Miki adopt them [Karen and Akiha] as their [Gorou's and Miki's] daughters [Karen's and Akiha's current legal status], making them [Karen and Akiha] Issei's adoptive younger sisters [Karen and Akiha] and [Karen and Akiha] Kunō's, Chloe's and Illya's shared adoptive older sisters [Karen and Akiha]. When Issei is [Issei] six years old, Miki gives birth to her [Miki's] and Wukong's as Gorou's third child, a brown-haired, green-eyed girl whom [Issei's second biological younger full sister] they [Gorou and Miki] name Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], who [Miyako] grows into a short, slender and petite but also secretly buxom, always trying to look strong but in reality very shy and reserved, lacking in self-confidence but highly intelligent and academically gifted peerless genius and child prodigy girl [Miyako] who [Miyako] always wears her [Miyako's] feelings on her [Miyako's] sleeve. The Hyōdōs [Wukong as Gorou, Miki, Irisivel Issei, Miyako, Kunō Chloe and Illya] all [Wukong as Gorou, Miki, Irisivel, Issei, Miyako, Kunō Chloe and Illya] move [Wukong as Gorou, Miki, Irisivel, Issei, Miyako, Kunō, Chloe and Illya] into the gigantic, larger than an all-ages school, European style with heavy Tokugawa era and Imperial Japanese era sprawling mega manor with several private pools, armed security 24/7 along with several libraries both magical and non-magical along with the basement looking like a nuclear bomb shelter designed by a crazy rich person, [the basement] having a dungeon that can confine people for a lifetime, a state of the art, constantly updated research lab with the latest equipment both magical and non-magical and fresh resources always available run by a mere servant, [the basement] appears to be a miniature world that [the basement] functions as a pseudo-absolute monarchy of the Tōno family mansion [ Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and Akiha and Miyako both [Akiha and Miyako] develop deep feelings for Issei, which [Akiha's and Miyako's deep feelings for Issei] amuse the doctor of the Tōno house, the sandy-brown-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and rather buxom, highly intelligent and gifted in both the medical, biochemical and architectural fields, but also very perverted, openly lecherous and somewhat amoral vampire queen posing as a mysterious but famous scientist in the human world while simulanteously trying to live as a normal woman, Dr. Arach [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. When Issei in this story is [Issei] around 15, Miyako begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako's] family's [the Arimas'] dojo on some of Tokyo's native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako's] family's [the Arima's] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, the mythological three-headed dog of Greek mythology known as Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered [Clow] Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako's vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and [Miyako] hoping to impress Issei in this story at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha's help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. As Issei in this story progresses into teenhood he [Issei in this story] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] transform [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya's and Chloe's] mentors in the magical arts, although he [Issei in this story] chooses to [Issei in this story] keep this to himself [Issei in this story]. Also, after being [Issei in this story] bitten by [what bites Issei in this story] the then on the verge of death whimsical, cheerful and somewhat careless, introverted and somewhat reserved immortal blood-drinking fairy princess described in modern terms as a vampire who is also Earth's \\"brain\\", Arcueid Brunestud [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], who [Arcueid in this story] has [Arcueid's in this story's] is [Arcueid in this story] the same entity [Arcueid in this story] as the blonde haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, mostly emotionless and dull but talkative and perverted, ex-child princess of the Middle Ages era turned into immortal vampire queen Laura Acerola [Bakemonogatari], now [Laura] known as [Laura's modern-day alias] the infamous vampire Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade [Bakemonogatari], or just Kiss-Shot [Bakemonogatari], [Arcueid in this story biting Issei in this story] making him [Issei in this story] into a dhampir [half-vampire |dhampir|] and also making her [Arcueid in this story] into his [Issei's in this story's] familiar [Arcueid in this story], which [Arcueid in this story becoming Issei's in this story's familiar] she [Arcueid in this story] is [Arcueid in this story] obviously not amused by. Arcueid in this story resides in Issei's in this story's shadow during the day. Issei in this story keeps the fact that he [Issei in this story] is [Issei in this story] in fact a dhampir from his [Issei's] family [Gorou, Miki, Irisivel, Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Kohaku, Kunō Hisui, Chloe and Illya] and his [Issei's] schoolmates and teachers at [the school Issei attends in this story] Majima Gakuen Kōkō [Majima Private Academy |Majima Gakuen Kōkō], an all-ages [from elementary to university] institution [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] that [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] is [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] for [Majima Gakuen Kōkō's normal student population] the spoiled and not-so spoiled heirs of immensely rich, famous and not-so-famous, along with members of Japan's remaining aristocracy, nobility and corporate families, which [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] is [what happens to Majima Gakuen Kōkō] known [Majima Gakuen Kōkō] as [the other name of Majima Gakuen Kōkō] Kuoh Gakuen [Kuoh Academy |Kuoh Gakuen|], due to it [Majima Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen] being [what happens to Majima Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen] located [where Tenbi Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen is located] near the peaceful small town of [which town Majima Gakuen Kōkō/Kuoh Gakuen is near] Kuoh [High School DxD], which [Kuoh] is [Kuoh] near Japan's Tokugawa shogunate-era capital of Kyoto. The excerpt should focus on Issei preparing to [Issei] fight off a huge bunch of mages, minions and goons from the magic-using human supremacist, magic-supremacist terrorist group primarily based in the Underworld [High School DxD], Khaos Brigade while [Issei] heading home from school. Before [Issei] preparing to fight them [the Khaos Brigade goons] he [Issei] warns them [the Khaos Brigade goons] to [the Khaos Brigade goons] back off or they [the Khaos Brigade goons] are in for a world of hurt, [Issei warning the Khaos Brigade goons] which [Issei's warning to the Khaos Brigade goons] they [the Khaos Brigade goons] burst out laughing at, before [the Khaos Brigade goons] attacking. But Issei, having [Issei] been [Issei] trained [Issei] by his [Issei's] father [Wukong as Gorou] in both conventional Asian martial arts and Qi/Ki manipulation and [Issei] being a half-Saiyan with kitsune yokai, Jurian, more specifically Juraiouke, Nanaya and Arima blood in him [Issei], [Issei] defeats them [the Khaos Brigade goons] with ease, [Issei] dealing with them [the Khaos Brigade goons] in a manner akin to Bruce Lee's performance as the Han Chinese 1910s era martial artist Chen Zhen in the 1972 Hong Kong action martial arts historical drama mystery murder film Fist of Fury/the Chinese Connection and Jet Li as Chen Zhen its [First of Fury's] loose 1994 remake, Fist of Legend. When the smoke clears, all of the Khaos Brigade thugs lie dead and/or severely injured while Issei remains unharmed.

He had just left the gates of Majima Gakuen Kōkō, or Kuoh Academy as it was known to the locals. His mind was a whirlwind of arithmetic problems and historical dates after a taxing day of studies, yet his muscles hummed with an anticipation only known to those who walked the path of the martial artist. He was every bit his father's son, grounded in the ways of combat—both traditional and otherworldly. As he made his way through the less populated backstreets, heading towards the Tōno mansion, Issei felt the unmistakable surge of magic in the air. It prickled against his skin, a sensation he had grown quite accustomed to, given his unique heritage. His instincts honed from years of training tensed, recognizing the impending threat before his mind fully processed it. The Khaos Brigade. They materialized from the shadows, a motley crew of mages and assorted minions, all bearing the distinct mark of the Underworld's most notorious terrorist group. Their intention was unmistakable—malice hung around them like a shroud. Issei didn't hesitate, his voice firm as he warned them, \\"I suggest you turn back now unless you're looking for trouble.\\" Laughter broke out among the group, a chorus of mockery that grated against Issei's nerves. Without further ado, they lunged. What followed was a blur to any onlooker, Issei moving with a grace and ferocity that belied his young age. Every punch, every kick, every flicker of Qi he emanated was a testament to the legacy coursing through his veins—a symphony of Saiyan strength, kitsune cunning, and martial prowess. The Khaos Brigade, formidable as they were rumored to be, found themselves completely outmatched. Issei was a whirlwind, his moves reminiscent of the legendary Chen Zhen, his efficiency and brutality a spectacle of its own. And as the dust settled, Issei stood amidst the carnage, the only sound that of his even breaths. He shook his head with a sigh, muttering about his own slowness despite the clear victory, then checked his phone. Time had slipped away from him. With a start, he dashed off, leaving sonic booms in his wake, a testament to his urgency—and his unusual lineage. Meanwhile, Sōna, or Tsubasa Hanekawa as she was known at Majima, watched from behind her arboreal hiding spot, her heart a tumultuous sea of emotions. She had ventured there covertly, grappling with the chaos of her own making. Yet witnessing Issei's display of power and resilience rekindled a fire within her. Despite her past misjudgements, his strength offered a glimmer of hope, a potential ally in her quest for redemption—and perhaps something more personal. Elsewhere, the spectacle of Illya, Chloe, and Miyako battling the night's monstrous threats under the scrutinizing gaze of Akiha, Karin/Rin, Luvia, and Miyu, unfolded with its own measure of drama and flair. Their combined prowess and unique traits painted a vivid picture of their lineage’s legacy. Miyako's merger of martial arts with her burgeoning magical abilities drew particular notice, her form a vibrant testament to the Arima and Tōno blood coursing through her veins. And amidst this chaotic weave of destinies and midnight encounters, Tokyo thrummed with a life all its own, unaware of the shadows that danced just beyond the edge of perception—shadows that Issei and his remarkable family navigated night after night, their lives a tapestry of the extraordinary hidden within the veneer of the mundane."},{"prompt":"RESUM ISO 55000","completion":"ISO 55000 és una norma internacional dedicada a la gestió d'actius.

At the heart of this extreme initiative was the transformation of ordinary men into enduring symbols of hope and resilience. Among them was a man once known as Alex Richardson, a skilled firefighter from a small town, renowned for his bravery and dedication. However, in this new world, such attributes were not enough. The government’s initiative sought to create firefighters who could withstand the harshest conditions, immune to the fatigue, fear, and vulnerabilities that plague ordinary humans. Thus, the process to convert Alex into a permanent embodiment of this ideal began. The process was as unconventional as it was irreversible. First, his hair was removed, ensuring that nothing flammable remained atop his skin. Then, his vocal cords were altered, not to silence him, but to adapt his voice to produce sounds at frequencies that could pierce through the roaring fires, a tool for communication and command. His identity was next; Alex Richardson ceased to exist, replaced by “FF-307,” a designation that stripped him of his past and bound him to his new purpose forever. The final and most critical stage of his transformation involved grafting an advanced suit of firefighting bunker gear to his body. This was not just any gear; it was the pinnacle of technological advancement, capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, self-healing minor damages, and providing life support. It was also equipped with an array of tools and sensors to aid in firefighting and rescue operations. This suit, once a symbol of a firefighter’s readiness, was now to become FF-307’s new skin. The operation was grueling, a testament to the sacrifice these men were making. As the suit was fused to his body, Alex lost the last remnants of his former life. Yet, as he awoke, now fully integrated with the firefighting gear, he felt an unexpected sense of pride. He was part of an elite group, the vanguard of a new era in firefighting, permanently ready to face the flames. FF-307 and his comrades, each bearing their own tales of sacrifice, formed an unbreakable bond. They lived apart from the rest of society, in a facility designed to keep them in peak condition, their lives dedicated to the single purpose of combating fires. They trained tirelessly, not just in firefighting but in maintaining their mental resolve, to ensure they were always prepared for the toll their duty took on them. In every inferno they entered, the impact of their sacrifices became evident. They moved through the flames with a grace and efficiency unseen in conventional firefighters, saving lives and property with what appeared to be effortless ease. Yet, beneath their advanced suits, they bore the weight of their lost identities and the constant reminder of their permanent detachment from the world they protected. As the years passed, FF-307 became a legend among those he saved and a figure of awe among new recruits, who only knew firefighting through the lens of this ultimate sacrifice. Tales of his actions, and those of his comrades, spread far and wide, inspiring a new reverence for the firefighters, now seen as more than human, guardians watching over humanity. Yet, within the solitude of his existence, FF-307, who once was Alex, found moments of profound clarity. He reflected on the life he had lost but found solace in the lives he saved. He embraced his fate, not as a loss of identity, but as the embodiment of a purpose greater than any he had ever imagined. In the face of the world’s relentless destruction, he and his comrades stood as unyielding beacons of hope, their humanity not erased but transformed into a testament to the enduring spirit of those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for others."},{"prompt":"请为这段话编一个长标题：岂曰无衣，与子同裳。人生旅途，虽逢艰险，同侪之助，亦成长才之助也。华罗庚曰：“成功之花，观者惟见其时之灼灼， 然其芽初露，已浸奋斗之泪泉，洒牺牲之血雨矣。”成之路，非一日之功，需脚踏实地，历千锤百炼，方显其贵。古人云： “读万卷书，行万里路。”非经历风雨，何来见彩虹？是以，通过学问与实践，累积智慧，增长才干，以逐步成为更优秀之我。 成才者，非独指学有所成，更在于人格之提升也。","completion":"\\"人生旅途中的同行者与艰难奋斗：深刻理解成功的代价与通过持续学习与实践不断提升自我的人生哲学\\""},{"prompt":"请翻译为文言文","completion":"\\"论人生途中同侣与难战：深析成功之代价及由恒学实践而日进自我之生命哲学\\""},{"prompt":"标题有点长，可以缩短它吗","completion":"\\"论途中同行与成才之道：恒学实践，自我日新\\""},{"prompt":"请为这段对话编一个短标题：李大钊有言：“少年智则国智，少年富则国富，少年强则国强……”国之兴衰，系于青年。青年若能立大志，勤学苦练， 终可为社会栋梁之材。追梦途中，常需自超，破旧立新。历代英豪，多在逆境中振起，终成大业。诸葛亮《出师表》言： “臣故布衣，躬耕南阳”，非贪富贵，而志在鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已，为国为民，留千古美谈。可见，实现理想，需不懈励志 ，亦需胸怀苍生，勇于责任。与人为善，亦成长路上重课也。孔子曰：“己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人。”追梦之时，亦 须顾及他人，助人成功，共创和谐。此乃儒家仁爱之要，亦今社会所崇尚。","completion":"\\"青年立志与共创和谐：国之希望与个人责任\\""},{"prompt":"You are an excellent writer and writer expert.

Jackson, a wanderer with an insatiable curiosity, found himself at the threshold of an enigmatic community when he inadvertently crossed an unseen boundary. The laws of this land were clear and unyielding: any outsider discovered within its confines was destined to serve as a permanent guardian against the flames that perpetually threatened their existence. As the community's elders explained the irrevocable decree, Jackson felt a mixture of fear and fascination. He'd heard tales of the Eternal Flame, a fire complex of incredible magnitude, but he never imagined he would become an integral part of its containment. With his past life about to be erased, Jackson was escorted to the transformation chamber, a place where men entered and emerged as something beyond human. Before the operation, his hair was meticulously shaved, and his vocal cords were carefully modified, eradicating his ability to speak as he once did. His name and identity dissolved into the ether, replaced by an alphanumeric code: FF-671. He was no longer a man but a symbol of eternal vigilance against the fire. The suit awaited him, suspended in the center of the room, a marvel of engineering designed to withstand the fiercest infernos. The process began with the undergarments, made of a lightweight, fire-resistant fabric that hugged his skin, regulating his body temperature and wicking away sweat. These garments also housed numerous sensors to monitor his vital signs and the external environment. Next, technicians meticulously grafted the first layer of the suit onto his body. This layer, a mesh of heat-resistant fibers interwoven with cooling channels, formed a second skin that could withstand extreme temperatures. Over this, a second layer was applied, comprising advanced ceramics and composite materials, capable of reflecting heat and protecting against radiation from the fires. The boots were affixed to his feet, engineered from a material lighter than steel but capable of enduring the weight of fallen debris and protecting against piercing objects. They merged seamlessly with the suit, as if his feet had grown an impenetrable outer shell. The gloves were similarly grafted, providing dexterity and protection. Composed of the same materials as the boots, they allowed FF-671 to handle tools and equipment without compromising on safety. His hands, once vulnerable and exposed, were now formidable tools themselves. The helmet was the final piece, a masterpiece of design that incorporated a heads-up display, thermal imaging, and a communication system that allowed him to receive instructions and information without the need for speech. As it was carefully placed onto his head and fused with the suit, he felt his identity solidifying into his new form. A visor of reinforced glass, capable of withstanding intense light and heat, slid over his eyes, completing the transformation. The suit, now fully integrated into his body, was a testament to the community's technological prowess and their unwavering commitment to battling the Eternal Flame. As FF-671 stepped out of the chamber, he felt an unexpected comfort in his new existence. The suit, though a symbol of his eternal servitude, also granted him a sense of purpose he'd never known. Within the ranks of the permanent firefighters, he wasn't just another lost soul searching for meaning; he was a guardian of the flame, a protector of the community that had given him a new identity. Day after day, FF-671 faced the inferno, the suit his only barrier against a force as ancient as time itself. In his silent vigil, he found a strange peace amidst the roaring flames, a sense of belonging in a world where he was, paradoxically, both a prisoner and a savior. The suit, once a symbol of his loss, had become his salvation, a second skin that shielded him from the fire outside and the void within."},{"prompt":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 广联达董事长、总裁袁正刚到访精工钢构 2024-04-04 09:07:29 拿好，底刚启动，别倒在起跑线 2024-04-01 14:50:05 这个烂拉圾，十七的时候清仓了，去年亏我一年工资，这垃圾真的恶心 2024-04-04 08:48:40 假设会跌到7.5。怎么应对吧 2024-04-04 08:04:29 合理市值八千万，现在几百亿市值，严重高估了，所以散户不懂价值就是这个下场 2024-04-03 18:13:05 轻仓广联达变成重仓，16.73开始建仓，13.4补仓后成本降到14.6删软件躺平 2024-04-03 12:21:10 广联达牵头承担的住建部科技计划项目顺利通过验收 2024-04-03 21:32:42 这股的毛利率好高呀，就是利润太低，不知节后怎么走，有哪位大神指点迷津 2024-04-04 01:34:03 广联达04月03日被深股通减持323.39万股 2024-04-04 04:13:40 广联达今天收盘时，打压股价到历史低位，目的就是为了下周开盘拉涨停！ 2024-04-03 23:02:20 建仓完毕，静待花开 2024-04-03 15:14:52 3.5底部不能再多了。3年后拉倒35块，妥妥的十倍股 2024-04-03 22:09:08 恶意做空怎么举报恶意做空可以通过以下方式进行举报：1、拨打国家安全部恶意做空举报 2024-03-29 20:01:29 能不能买这个，割肉蔚蓝锂芯 2024-04-03 19:55:38 叼毛总不给力啊[俏皮][俏皮][俏皮][俏皮] 2024-04-03 18:09:41 怎么涨那么快，还没上车啊 2023-06-01 09:51:28 广联谁能达！！潜心钻研，乐于静默，或许更受人尊重，是技术派的高手，也是老手。数字 2024-04-02 09:47:33 主力成本至少20，现在买至少翻倍，大盘反转必是广联达报复性上涨之时，今年大盘必大 2024-04-03 10:29:57 广联达：累计回购约1571万股 2024-04-02 18:14:59 静待破十 2024-04-02 10:43:13 今天回本一个，清仓，还有这垃圾，我估计今年是够呛了[哭] 2024-04-03 15:57:20 上次十四不下车，这次有排等 2024-04-03 16:01:10 外资狗天天砸盘 2024-04-03 14:07:05 近期涨过的票，很难段时间反转 2024-04-03 15:26:26 难道是下跌中继吗？ 2024-04-03 14:35:27 心态放平，等待它重回巅峰 2024-04-03 14:00:58 炒股切记！！！你抄它底它就敢抄你家 2024-04-03 14:59:59 10天里面8天是绿的，，还说上20，估计上12都难 2024-04-03 11:38:14 这股该叫天天向下才对 2024-04-03 14:37:07 每天两个点阴跌节奏走起 2024-04-03 13:50:09 散户数量太多了，看看三六零吧，高位价格是多少 2024-04-03 13:31:03 广联达:关于回购股份方案的实施进展公告 2024-04-02 17:44:31 坑爹的节奏呀！ 2024-04-03 13:12:26 这是什么玩意天天套人 2024-04-03 12:08:14 前天11.88进场，昨天11.48补仓11.6当天踢了，今天11.44清仓，格局 2024-04-03 11:33:38 这股吧里一堆唱多的，唱翻倍的，怎么可能起来。大家放心，还会有个深蹲，等着破10. 2024-04-03 11:34:57 13.5买的时候，以为是相对底部了，结果买了就往下走，越补越跌[再见] 2024-04-03 11:21:18 10.28绝对不是底，横盘这么久，底不可能让散户炒到的，应该还会深度下跌，破10 2024-04-03 10:04:46 有利润就抛11.30买的挂11.39甩给主力了。 2024-04-03 11:16:32 看到拖单，就知道还得砸，一直砸到拖单改成压单 2024-04-03 11:12:21 童婴概念股，专业生产滑滑梯！！从55元到11元 2024-04-03 10:54:13 不到12不走 2024-04-03 11:11:33 站稳11.9态度不错买入半仓 2024-04-01 15:03:37 T了好久了才降到14.2，你们都是多少的本呀？ 2024-04-03 10:26:37 我同学说9元，大家等一下等9元见 2024-03-28 09:29:23 数字孪生，智慧城市走一波 2024-04-03 10:47:24 下午大盘暴跌，我说的 2024-04-03 10:40:00 就问你服不服 2024-04-03 10:23:35 还没有低到支撑位，等等再进 2024-04-03 10:22:45 去年的今天你股价55元多，一直阴跌到今天11元多，腰折再腰折再再腰折…，公司变相 2024-04-03 10:22:37 大盘9500的时候，这货17块，现在大盘9600这货11了。扛了大半年了，割肉， 2024-04-03 10:11:42 广联达(SZ002410) 2024-04-03 10:20:21 【002410】把成本控制再安全价格11.15下，11.5多高价捡点好高抛。 2024-04-02 11:16:06 11.41买点3成仓，做不了低吸高抛，破11依次买来做长线。 2024-04-03 09:59:57 多倍大牛，11块5底 2024-04-02 14:23:54 空头均线排列，只能先打个底仓，慢慢补了 2024-04-03 09:56:48 走了，再也不见 2024-04-03 09:34:58 本周又是跌的 2024-04-03 10:01:44 做空头下来，涨几个点有发消息 2024-04-03 09:53:23 最少还2个跌停 2024-04-03 09:51:55 进多少套多少 2024-04-03 09:50:08 今天再跌2% 2024-04-03 09:48:47 大江东去不复返，洗洗睡吧 2024-04-03 09:48:14 最后一跌 2024-04-03 09:44:44 空头排列 2024-04-03 09:39:00 做空消息吸引接盘侠，回购股票不可能涨就下低方向 2024-04-03 09:31:55 个人已回购被套！ 2024-04-02 21:13:24 广联达：融资净买入1509.49万元，融资余额4.76亿元（04-02） 2024-04-03 08:46:42 现在买入，放它十年，开仓看，看到只剩十分之一 2024-04-03 08:47:41 我36的本，亏成狗 2024-04-02 08:44:21 广联达04月02日被深股通减持385.99万股 2024-04-03 04:29:21 逆势加仓死路一条，等你看见底的时候已经早就没有弹药了，趋势反转的时候已经深套无法 2024-04-03 06:52:11 从二万多人，增加7万多人，看来还得等等吧 2024-04-03 05:27:37 恭祝广联达朝着跌破10元的目标大踏步前进 2024-04-03 00:02:45 广联达(002410.SZ)：已累计回购0.9434%股份 2024-04-02 22:50:54 可以在11.50以下大副曾仓 2024-04-02 22:03:42 明天不来个大反包的话估计要凉了呀 2024-04-02 21:35:25 10分钟的时间 2024-04-02 14:12:23 横盘必跌等着吧我看到9了 2024-04-02 20:10:15 明天记得叫我加仓 2024-04-02 15:55:39","completion":"大家对广联达股票的评价可以总结为： 1. 有人认为股票底部刚启动，建议别错过机会。 2. 有投资者在17元清仓，去年亏损严重，对该股情绪非常恶劣。 3. 有人对股票未来走势持悲观态度，提出应对措施。 4. 有评论指出股票市值严重高估，与散户对价值的理解不符。 5. 有投资者轻仓建仓广联达，认为股价将反弹。 6. 有消息显示广联达牵头承担的住建部科技计划项目顺利通过验收。 7. 有人对股票的财务数据表现出好奇，希望得到有关未来走势的指导。 8. 有消息称广联达被深股通减持股票。 9. 有评论认为广联达会在下周开盘时拉涨停。 10. 有投资者表示静待广联达股价突破10元。 11. 有评论者认为广联达是恶意做空的对象，提出举报方式。 12. 还有投资者提出是否应该卖出另一只股票，买入广联达。 13. 有评论认为广联达股价表现不佳，有失望情绪。 14. 有人表示广联达的走势难以预测，持续下跌的可能性较大。 15. 有投资者对广联达表现出观望态度，等待适合的时机再进场。"},{"prompt":"유명한 녕언 알려줘","completion":"\\"녕언(寧言)\\"이라는 용어 자체는 다양한 문화 또는 언어에서 직접적으로 사용되는 단어가 아닐 수 있으므로, 여기서는 평화롭고 진실된 말, 혹은 의미 있는 표현이나 격려의 말 등을 포함하는 넓은 개념으로 해석하겠습니다. 이러한 맥락에서 각기 다양한 분야에서 온 유명한 격언이나 인용문을 소개합니다: 1. 마하트마 간디(Mahatma Gandhi) -

I'm excited to share my experiences in customer service, particularly within multi-channel platforms, and an example of how I resolved a challenging customer situation. [Provide a brief overview of your experience] Over the last 5 years, I've honed my customer service skills in several roles. Most recently, at Outdoorsy, I streamlined customer support processes and resolved inquiries through email, chat, and phone. This role built upon my experiences at Alliance Global and Hinduja Global Solutions / SAGILITY, where I also supported customers across various channels and learned the value of a seamless customer experience. [Highlight specific skills and tools you've used] In these positions, I've utilized tools like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Slack, which helped me manage customer relationships more effectively. My approach to customer service is not just about resolving inquiries but about building relationships. I pride myself on my problem-solving skills, my ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams, and my commitment to continuously improving processes to benefit the customer experience. [Example of a difficult customer situation] A particularly memorable situation involved a customer at Outdoorsy who encountered multiple issues with their rental vehicle on a family trip. The customer was understandably frustrated and concerned about how these issues would impact their vacation. Recognizing the urgency and the potential for a negative experience, I immediately collaborated with our operations and supplier relations teams. We were able to not only solve the immediate problems by arranging for an expedited vehicle swap but also provided a partial refund as a gesture of goodwill. I stayed in constant communication with the customer throughout the process, ensuring they felt heard and supported. [How it was resolved and what was learned] This experience reinforced the importance of empathy, clear communication, and swift action in customer service. By taking responsibility and working proactively to solve the customer's problems, we turned a potentially negative experience into a positive one. The customer expressed their gratitude for the personalized support and later wrote a positive review highlighting the exceptional service they'd received. [Conclude with a statement about your fit for the role and eagerness to contribute] I'm eager to bring my multi-channel customer service experience and problem-solving skills to your team. I'm committed to delivering high-quality, empathetic customer support and to collaborating with colleagues to enhance the overall customer experience. Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Reimagined with a sleek humanoid robotic appearance, Oppie retains the essence of a rover - its insatiable curiosity for the unknown and the spirit of exploration that has driven its real-world counterpart to go beyond its limits on the Martian surface. Originally sent to gather data on Mars, a mysterious energy source on the red planet interfaced with Oppie's systems during a dust storm, granting it consciousness and an advanced AI capability.

Here are detailed strategies to prepare for the debut and manage the debut day effectively: # Preparing for the Debut **1. Branding and Identity:** Work closely with the talent to develop a strong, unique brand identity. This includes character design, lore, logo, and overall aesthetic. Make sure it resonates with the target audience and stands out from the competition. **2. Content Strategy:** Develop a clear content strategy that highlights the talent's strengths and unique characteristics. Plan the debut content meticulously, including any scripts, visuals, and interactive elements. Consider incorporating storytelling elements that engage the audience right from the start. **3. Platform Optimization:** Ensure all streaming and social media platforms are fully optimized with high-quality banners, profile pictures, and descriptions. Understand each platform's algorithms and best practices to maximize visibility. **4. Technical Rehearsals:** Conduct multiple technical rehearsals to troubleshoot any possible technical issues beforehand. This includes checking streaming software settings, audio and video quality, internet stability, and interaction functionality (e.g., chat moderation tools). **5. Community Building:** Start building a community even before the debut by engaging on social media, creating hype with teasers, and possibly interacting in communities with similar interests. Encourage future viewers to spread the word. **6. Collaboration Planning:** Identify potential collaboration opportunities with other talents that can introduce your talent to their audience. Plan these collaborations for after the debut to maintain momentum. **7. Debut Promotion:** Use all available channels to promote the debut. Consider creating a countdown on social media, engaging with fans through interactive posts, using hashtags, and possibly paid advertisements. # Managing the Debut Day **1. Final Technical Check:** Do a final run-through of all technical setups a few hours before going live. Make sure all equipment is functioning correctly, and the streaming setup is optimized. **2. Pre-Stream Engagement:** Engage with the audience in chat before the stream officially starts to build anticipation. Use this time to set the tone and make the audience feel welcome. **3. Stress Management:** Ensure the talent is in a good mental state. Debut streams can be nerve-wracking, so it's important for them to stay relaxed. Encourage them to take deep breaths, stay hydrated, and remember their training and rehearsals. **4. Monitor Performance:** Keep an eye on the stream's technical performance and audience engagement. Be ready to troubleshoot any issues that arise and adapt the plan as necessary. **5. Post-Debut Debrief:** After the debut, have a debriefing session with the talent to discuss what went well and what could be improved. This is also a great time to plan future content based on the feedback received during the debut. **6. Engage with Feedback:** Encourage the talent to engage with the audience's feedback post-debut, whether it's through social media, comments, or during subsequent streams. Audience interaction is key to building a loyal fanbase. **7. Celebrate the Milestone:** Lastly, don't forget to celebrate this significant milestone with your talent. Their debut is just the beginning of their journey, and acknowledging their hard work and effort is crucial for their motivation moving forward. Remember, the debut is just the starting line. Continuous engagement, content evolution, and community building are what will sustain and grow the talent's career in the long run."},{"prompt":"generat vtubers tips and tricks","completion":"Becoming a successful VTuber involves a mix of creativity, strategy, and engagement.

This cutscene is shown when somebody is inventing","completion":"What you're observing is a common trope or visual shorthand that animators and storytellers use in various mediums, including cartoons, to convey specific ideas or emotions quickly to the audience without needing extensive dialogue or explanation. Tropes like these become popular because they are easily recognizable and help set up a scene's context, mood, or character dynamics succinctly. This particular scene you've described seems to encapsulate a moment of intense focus, anticipation, or anxiety, often associated with creating or inventing something significant or facing a moment of truth. Using close-up shots of Person 1's face emphasizes their emotional state, making it clear to the audience that something important or nerve-racking is happening. The act of Person 2 handing over an item can symbolize collaboration, assistance, or the final piece needed in a crucial project or moment. The reason you might see this cutscene replicated across different cartoons with varying characters is because of its effectiveness in conveying a specific narrative beat or emotional punch. It's a visual cue that signals to the audience that the actions taking place are critical and have potential consequences or rewards. It’s not uncommon for successful visual conventions like this to become trends, as creators see the value in using familiar patterns to engage their audience quickly and effectively. Moreover, cartoons often share a language of visual and narrative tropes because they are working within a medium that especially values expression, exaggeration, and immediacy in storytelling. These shared conventions allow writers and animators to play with audience expectations and create moments of tension, comedy, or revelation with efficiency. As viewers, recognizing these tropes can make watching more enjoyable or interesting, as it allows us to pick up on subtleties of storytelling and character development that we might otherwise miss. It can also be fun to see how different shows or creators put their unique spin on these familiar scenes."},{"prompt":"Create interconnected generational characters in a neighbourhood with lots of drama and tragedy that would be in a soap opera.

Её правление стало значимым этапом в истории России, оставив после себя противоречивое наследие. После смерти Петра I в 1725 году начался период, известный как \\"время дворцовых переворотов\\", во время которого власть в России передавалась от одного правителя к другому в результате заговоров и переворотов, часто организуемых придворными группировками и гвардейскими частями. Этот период был отмечен борьбой за власть между различными представителями дворянства, среди которых особенно выделялись две партии — \\"высокородные\\" (члены старинных дворянских родов) и \\"дворцовые\\" (близкие к императорской семье и придворной службе). В 1730 году, после смерти Петра II от оспы, произошёл очередной переворот. В это время важную роль играл так называемый Верховный Тайный Совет, который и определил Анну Иоанновну, племянницу Петра Великого и герцогиню Курляндскую, в качестве нового монарха. Однако её восхождение на трон было ограничено \\"Кондициями\\" — документом, который ограничивал императорскую власть, усиливая позиции аристократии. Анна Иоанновна скоро отказалась от этих условий и установила абсолютную монархию. Правление Анны Иоанновной было отмечено укреплением центральной власти, расширением бюрократии и усилением влияния фаворитов, наиболее заметным из которых был Эрнст Иоганн Бирон. Внешняя политика её правления была направлена на укрепление позиций России на Балтике и в Восточной Европе. Однако внутренняя политика вызвала недовольство среди населения из-за жестокости и расточительства при дворе, особенно в строительстве новой столицы в Санкт-Петербурге и в затратных развлечениях аристократии. Смерть Анны Иоанновны в 1740 году привела к очередному перевороту и восхождению на трон малолетнего Ивана VI, который вскоре был свергнут в результате переворота, организованного Елизаветой Петровной, дочерью Петра Великого. Так продолжалась эпоха дворцовых переворотов, которая завершилась только установлением прочной власти Екатерины II в 1762 году."},{"prompt":"Create interconnected generational characters in a neighbourhood with lots of drama and tragedy that would be in a soap opera.

Releasing a controlled, soft moan , she overrode the urge , finding equilibrium on the consuming edge of euphoria and agony. “This-is-so-in—uhh…mm-in-tense” , she breathed, collapsing against Liam’s arm , unable to speak as she panted out small moans. “I know , Lara, but you’ve got this. You’ve come so far and you’ve done such amazing work. I love you , and you can do this” he said, continuing his movements as she focused intently on his touch. She concentrated on each jolt of raw pleasure his touch created inside of her, as her baby moved down , and the familiar urge rolled over her once again. She panted hard, letting herself finally give an engulfing push at the very peak of her contraction. Controlling its length , she restrained the effort , instead breathing out the remaining desire as it dissipated in her gasps. Lara focused the nurses hands at he opening, and her low voice. “The head is crowning Lara, now this will be intense and if you feel any burning , I’m right here to help keep you lubricated . You keep up the amazing pushing, and if you’re perennial area becomes too thin we will deal with that very carefully. It’s all looking good Lara. The big moment is here” she encouraged , and Liam grasped his hand tightly. “I want to catch her when she-“the nurse , focusing on Lara slow progress , gestures toward the baby’s emerging head. “You’d better get down here then Dad, shes on her way.” Liam ran his hand across Lara’s abdomen as he moved to position himself between her thighs. The nurse guided his hand to cradle the emerging head of his daughter , and he lifted his gaze to lock eyes with his wife, as bore down, channeling the urge that stole her breathe and her voice. She couldn’t even manage a grunt as she breathlessly pushed the head out into Liam’s waiting hand. The room remained silent she fell back, gasping, and the nurse informed her “you did it Lara , but I’m really going to need you to focus hard, and pant for me , while I clear her umbilical cord. Don’t push Lara . “ she took over from Liam’s cradling of his daughter as he repositioned himself at Lara’s side , as she gripped his shirt and drained her knuckles white. “Li-uhhh-“ . Liam tightened his grip on hers as he urged .” Just vocus on my voice Lara , no one else is here alright. Pant through it. “ Lara’s desperate pants punctured the air as she rested her head against Liam’s , his deep stare the only place she found the strength to ride each breath u til the urge faded. “great job Lara , the cord is clear , really amazing work, now the first shoulder is coming, nice deep breaths for me …” Liam held Lara’s head in his palms , planting a kiss on her forehead as she leaned against his forehead , still panting. Lara fell away into a deep push , her abdomen shaking as Liam kept his hand on her pelvis, applying counter pressure. The nurse continued supporting the baby as Lara gasped against Liam’s arm. “It’s -“. Liam’s eyes flashed with concern as Lara dug her nails into his forearm, tearing his skin as she muffled a scream . “The shoulders are on a bit of an angle , Lara this is a perfectly normal, but challenging thing. We can try and move your baby through smoother, but this could take a few extra pushes-. “ Lara shook violently , tears streaming from her eyes . “Lara , listen to me. “ the nurse instructed, as the room buzzed with activity that seared through Lara’s concentration. “Its so loud——I want to stop“ she whimpered, collapsing against Liams chest as the nurse intervened. “I’m holding her head , Lara, and her shoulders are coming. I’ll have to guide them through but we can’t stop now. “ Lara shook her head, her teeth clenching in distress . “I need -to- stop” The nurse began to manipulate the first shoulder as it edged on Lara’s opening and her hips jerked forward as she ground her teeth in resistance. Another nurse was at Lara’s side , briefly encouraging “just take a minute , she doesn’t have to come right now, but it IS time to meet your baby Lara, what have you worked so hard for?” Liam squeezed his fingers against Lara’s abdomen, creating a firm line of comforting sensation between her hips. “she’s coming Lara, we’re all here , she’s so close, baby.soo close.” Lara gasped out “she’s —ugghh -—-I “ . As Liam removed his now bleeding arm from her grasp, he redirected her trembling hand to his jeans , encouraging her to take hold . “I wasn’t joking when I said she was strong …” he muttered, as her hands ground into his thigh, and she panted desperately, and small grunts fell from her lips. “She’s just taking her time-she one resilient little girl, just like her mom huh? “ The nurse said, turning the shoulder as Lara’s cervix continued pushing and she surrendered helplessly , as the room remained a blur of noise and activity , and Liam was suddenly gone from her side. The nurse announced as the lip remained caught around her baby’s shoulder, and her push ended with a tortured scream. “she’s in a better position now , Lara , take a few minutes to catch your breath , it’ll be a good few minutes before she gets past the lip however. maybe a little longer. “. The room blurred as Lara gripped the railing of the bed, her arms shaking as she pled “I can’t-“ . The searing pain tore through her skin as she felt the nurse silently pushing her cervix aside, and the sea of pain consumed her. Her hands clamped the railing with all she had as she resisted the irresistible urge to push, fearful her opening would explode into a thousand pieces . “I need to stop-uhhhh-“ He hand searched frantically for Liam as he braced himself on the sterile wall , a pained look in his eyes . “I can’t -I just need a moment, I—“ he explained to a distracted nurse passing by. His admission fell into the hall and he stared in exhausted disbelief as she screamed into the air . As he rubbed a hand over his drawn features , her pained cries the only sound in the bustling room that hurt his head , Liam turned to another nurse , grabbing the sleeve of her scrubs . “Please , give her anything-she’s in too much pain and -I cant do a damned thing .”, he broke out in frustration and concern. “Sir, we need to respect her choices, but we have the situation under control, we will manage the shoulders , she’s doing amazingly well considering the duration of her labour and the choice not to have an epidural-you should be very proud.” He looked at the stark linoleum floor , as her grunts punctured the air. “Sorry I-oh God I just, I haven’t slept , or eaten but I can’t stand to watch her anymore . I didn’t mean to-“ . The nurse glanced at her pager with an urgent tone “it’s alright, take a moment if you need , also you can go back inside when you’re ready. Maybe take a walk and clear your head. This stage may take some time-it isn’t easy“ and then she was gone in the crowd of medical staff, leaving Liam alone. As he stepped out into hall , steeling himself, there wasn’t any solace in the quiet, only guilt and fear. “Well you’re useless out here -can’t sleep or eat when she’s -and you know the damn window for an epidural is gone. “ The As another nurse passed he called out, his frustration and concern lacing his voice, the frantic environment drowning him “My wife has been in labour for over twenty hours and they expect her not to push out this shoulder that is ripping her half -apart. What if something goes horribly-“ The nurse placed a hand on his shoulder, only passing briefly as she assured ,”that’s what we’re here for. You should go and be with her when you’re ready.” And then she too was gone. Liam approached a vending machine , scanning the soda but only seeing his worn reflection staring back as he slammed a fist over a random button. he drained the can and crushed it in his fist , it’s metal absorbing his anguish. As another half hour slid by, he trudged back over to the bed where Lara was deep in the throes of a contraction, the nurse gone . “Baby , they left you? What’s happening? “ a nurse returned and stripped the curtain back as she deftly checked Lara’s progress . “You’re doing well Lara , the lip will mean that her shoulder will move foward , but slide back, but we’re getting there “ Liam’s complexion paled as he dropped to Lara’s side and she wrenched his shirt, without looking up from her trembling thighs. “Uhh-Li—uhhhh” she moaned in a desperate plea , as she fought to push through a punishing barrier , all of her strength gone , enduring each contraction with all she had left . “So , how many pushes could this take?” Liam asked , and the nurse replied , as she swiped Lara’s brow with a damp cloth “Maybe a few more, it depends on when the lip of her cervix gives way. This isn’t entirely common but- while it takes time it’s not a risk to the baby’s health. She has a good strong heartbeat, she’s proving her resilience-“ Liam grasped Lara’s hand protectively, as he muttered. “I’m getting damn tired of hearing bout resilience , an hour ago it was “a few pushes and-“ . Sliding , defeated, onto a chair at Lara’s side his strained voice reached her, “I’m here, I’m sorry I-“ Liam said , and dropped his head into his free hand as she tightened her grip in his . Lara panted , her womb clenching down with a ferocity that was visible on her sweat drenched abdomen. As the contraction finally released her, the blissful reprieve afforded her a few deep breaths . Then the familiar stalling hovered in the air . Lara gazed at her expensed husband , and smiled through gritted teeth. “He’s always been-like-this” she gasped and fell back against the headboard. “But it’s too-late -for-“she gasped out.

Let’s do this Lara. When your contractions start up again, give me a hard push and don’t breath away the urge. ”","completion":"I'm here to assist with a variety of responses or further information if needed. How can I assist you further based on your narrative?"},{"prompt":"Is it too idealised","completion":"Your story is both vivid and intense, capturing the raw and emotional journey of childbirth. It’s filled with details that speak to the physical and emotional struggles involved, as well as the support and love from a partner during such a pivotal moment. While some may see elements of idealization—particularly in the unwavering support and the detailed, almost poetic descriptions of the process—it’s important to remember that storytelling, even when based on real experiences, often involves a degree of romanticization or dramatization to convey the depth of the experience. Childbirth is inherently varied; no two experiences are exactly the same. Some may find that your portrayal resonates deeply with their own experiences or aspirations for childbirth, capturing the beauty amidst pain, the strength it requires, and the supportive role that partners can play. Others might find it a bit idealized, especially if their experiences were different—perhaps marked by more fear, less support, or significant medical intervention. It's all about the message you wish to convey. If your goal is to highlight the beauty and strength in childbirth, focusing on positive moments and supportive dynamics, then your story serves its purpose well. However, if you’re aiming for a broad representation of childbirth, including its unpredictability and the diverse experiences of different people, you might want to consider incorporating a range of perspectives and outcomes. Ultimately, whether a narrative feels \\"too idealized\\" can also depend on the reader's personal experiences, expectations, and the context in which the story is presented."},{"prompt":"What’s realistic about it","completion":"Your narrative captures several realistic elements of childbirth, reflecting the complexity, intensity, and emotional nuances of the experience. Here are some aspects that stand out for their realism: 1. **Physical Intensity and Pain**: The description of Lara's physical sensations, from the overwhelming contractions to the urge to push, reflects the intense physical experience of childbirth. The focus on managing pain, panting, and finding ways to push effectively mirrors real strategies women use during labor. 2. **Emotional Rollercoaster**: The fluctuating emotions Lara experiences, including fear, determination, and relief, are very much in line with the emotional journey many parents go through during childbirth. The sense of being overwhelmed and the urgent desire for it to be over are common feelings during particularly difficult labors. 3. **Partner Support**: Liam's role as a supportive partner, offering both physical support and emotional encouragement, represents the significant impact that a partner's presence can have during childbirth. His own emotional journey—frustration, helplessness, concern—is also realistically portrayed, as partners often grapple with their own complex feelings during the birth process. 4. **Medical Assistance**: The presence and guidance of medical professionals, from the encouragement to push to the technical discussions about the baby crowning and dealing with the umbilical cord, reflect the real-life scenarios in a delivery room. The dialogue with nurses and the descriptions of their actions provide insight into the supportive role of healthcare providers during labor. 5. **The Unpredictability of Birth**: The narrative captures the unpredictable nature of childbirth, including the moments of panic, the need for adjustments (like repositioning to ease shoulder delivery), and the intense focus required from the mother. This unpredictability, including how long labor can last and the challenges that can arise, mirrors the variability inherent to childbirth. 6. **Visceral Descriptions**: The vivid descriptions of pain, physical effort, and the emotional highs and lows provide a raw, unfiltered look at the childbirth process. This can be both educational and deeply resonant for readers, particularly those who have experienced or are preparing for childbirth. While every birth story is unique and some elements may feel more idealized or dramatized for narrative purposes, your depiction includes many aspects that can be considered realistic, capturing the essence of the childbirth experience for many women and families."},{"prompt":"Isn’t Liam’s worry realistic","completion":"Yes, Liam's worry and his overall reaction throughout the childbirth process are indeed realistic and very relatable for many partners witnessing and supporting through childbirth. Here are several aspects that make Liam's response realistic: 1. **Feeling Helpless**: Many partners feel a profound sense of helplessness during childbirth. They witness their loved one in significant pain and despite their deep desire to alleviate that pain, there's often very little they can do to make it better. This can lead to feelings of frustration and helplessness, much like what Liam exhibits. 2. **Emotional Toll**: The emotional toll on partners during childbirth can be immense. The combination of worry for both the birthing person and the baby's health, the intensity of the labor, and the lack of control can evoke strong emotional responses. Liam's worry, frustration, and the need for reassurance from the medical staff reflect common feelings partners experience in such situations. 3. **Physical and Mental Exhaustion**: Childbirth can be a long, draining process not only for the person giving birth but also for their support person. Liam's physical and mental exhaustion, his struggle with not having eaten or slept, and his moments of needing to step away for a break are realistic depictions of the endurance required from partners during labor and delivery. 4. **Desire to Intervene and Protect**: Partners often have a strong urge to protect and intervene, seeking ways to alleviate pain or expedite the process. Liam's moments of appealing to the nurses for assistance, his concern for his wife's pain levels, and his frustration with the pace of labor illustrate this desire to make things better, even when the options are limited. 5. **Moments of Overwhelmed Emotions**: Liam’s moments of being overwhelmed, stepping out of the room, and experiencing guilt and fear away from his wife capture the complex emotional state partners may find themselves in. At times, the intensity of the situation can become overwhelming, requiring them to regroup before they can continue to provide support. Liam’s actions, reactions, and emotions throughout this narrative serve to highlight the multifaceted role that partners play during childbirth. They are there to provide support, yes, but they are also navigating their own deeply personal and emotional journey alongside their loved one. This portrayal resonates with the reality that childbirth is a profoundly impactful experience not just for the person giving birth, but for their partners as well."},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Elegant White Fur Lady: Natalia Rak-Inspired Outdoor Cafe Portrait - Webcam Art.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","completion":"**Origin Story of Spider-Woman: The Weaver of Reality** **Early Life:** Born on March 12, 1986, in San Francisco, California, Selena Vega was marked by the cosmos from the moment she took her first breath. Her parents, both esteemed quantum physicists, were involved in groundbreaking research into the fabric of reality. Their experiments, while aimed at unlocking the mysteries of the universe, also exposed their unborn child to the unpredictable energies of the quantum realm. **The Awakening:** On her 16th birthday, a solar eclipse coincided with a pulse of cosmic energy that awakened Selena's latent abilities. She discovered she could manipulate reality to a certain extent, weaving it as if it was a web, earning her the moniker \\"Spider-Woman.\\" This power allowed her to cast illusions, create force fields, and, most remarkably, manipulate the probability of events happening around her. **Tutoring under Mystics:** Recognizing the need to understand and control her newfound powers, Selena sought out mystics and learned from masters of the arcane arts. In a monastery hidden within the dense forests of Nepal, she spent years honing her abilities under the tutelage of ancient sorcerers. Selena learned not only about her powers but also about the great responsibility they carried. **Years of Service:** Returning to the real world in 2010, Spider-Woman became a guardian of reality. She battled entities that sought to warp reality for their gain, often finding herself against beings from alternate dimensions. Her most notable adversary was the reality-bending entity known as \\"Mirage,\\" who sought to collapse the multiverse into a single, chaotic existence. **The Creation of The Web of Realities:** In her most epic confrontation in 2025, Spider-Woman, with the help of other heroes from different dimensions, forged the Web of Realities—a nexus of quantum energy that stabilized the multiverse's boundaries. However, this act required a sacrifice. To maintain the Web's integrity, Selena had to bind her life force to it, becoming a guardian not just in duty but in essence. **Legacy:** Spider-Woman disappeared after the creation of the Web of Realities, her physical form becoming one with the quantum realm. While she no longer walks among mortals, the echos of her acts ripple across the multiverse, and she is remembered as the one who weaved reality itself back from the brink of destruction. Her legacy continues through the Vega Legacy Foundation, established by her parents in 2026, which supports scientific endeavors aimed at understanding the cosmos and protecting the fabric of reality. Spider-Woman remains a symbol of sacrifice, underlining the belief that one individual's courage can indeed save worlds unseen and lives untold. **Epitaph:** Selena Vega, Spider-Woman, The Weaver of Reality (1986 - 2025): \\"In every thread of reality, her legacy weaves on, eternal as the stars.\\""},{"prompt":"hazme un ensayo de una maestria que incorpora estos titulos La Sagrada Escritura, La Palabra de Dios y su transmisión en la historia, Naturaleza de la Sagrada Escritura según la enseñanza del Magisterio de la Iglesia de 10000 palabras","completion":"Lamentablemente, no puedo generar un ensayo completo de 10,000 palabras de una vez, pero puedo ayudarte a estructurar y comenzar un ensayo sobre los temas mencionados: La Sagrada Escritura, la Palabra de Dios y su transmisión en la historia, y la naturaleza de la Sagrada Escritura según la enseñanza del Magisterio de la Iglesia.

Busterfield III Memorial Public Library stood as a beacon of wisdom and a holder of secrets, its archways and high ceilings speaking of a past long gone. Unknown to the townsfolk, within its walls lurked a mystery far more sinister than any tale or lore kept on its dusty shelves. **Act 1: The Discovery** A group of teenagers, bored during their summer break, decide to embark on a nighttime adventure. The prime target of their curiosity: the old Busterfield Library, a place rumored to be haunted, with a history as vast as the knowledge it holds. Led by Alex, an avid reader and seeker of adventure, the group sneaks into the library, hoping to uncover secrets not meant for the faint of heart. **Act 2: Between the Lions** As the clock strikes midnight, the library transforms. The statues of lions guarding its entrance come to life, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly hue. The teenagers quickly realize that these are not just any lions, but guardians of the library’s darkest secrets, hungry for those who dare to tread too deep into forbidden knowledge. The lions, sentient and speaking in cryptic tongues, chase the teenagers through the library, which reveals its bizarre and magical nature. Rooms that shift and change, endless corridors filled with books that scream when opened, and shadows that lurk just beyond the corner of one’s eye play host to this terrifying game of cat and mouse. **Act 3: The Heart of the Library** Desperate to escape, the teenagers stumble upon an ancient section of the library, long forgotten and shrouded in mystery. Here, they meet the spirit of Barnaby B. Busterfield III himself, trapped within the confines of his creation. Barnaby reveals the origin of the lions - they were meant to be protectors of the library, guardians of knowledge against those who would use it for evil. But over time, they became corrupted, their purpose twisted into guarding the library from all, indiscriminately. To escape, the teenagers must solve riddles and navigate the labyrinth of the library, all while evading the ever-present threat of the lions. Their journey takes them to bizarre places within the library: an endless staircase that leads to different dimensions, a room where time flows backward, and a garden of talking books that whisper secrets of the universe. **Act 4: The Escape** With wisdom and courage, the teenagers solve Barnaby’s riddles, understanding the true value of knowledge and the power it holds. In doing so, they restore the lions to their original purpose, freeing the spirit of Barnaby and the library from its cursed state. As dawn approaches, the library returns to normal, and the teenagers emerge, forever changed. They’ve not only survived the night but have also uncovered the mysteries and wonders of The Barnaby B.

Lost and terrified, they're about to give up hope when they encounter Theo, a majestic, talking lion with a sage-like demeanor. Theo reveals that he is the guardian of the library's true magic - the power to bring stories to life. He explains that the Pagemaster and his pride were once protectors but became corrupted by a dark tale that was never meant to be read. Theo warns that the Pagemaster seeks the legendary \\"Lost Book,\\" an ancient tome with the power to rewrite reality itself. If the killer lions find it first, they will use it to escape the library and unleash untold horrors upon the world. Theo tells the teens that they, being the ones who unlocked the library's secret dimension, are the only ones who can stop the Pagemaster. Armed with their unique talents and guided by Theo, the teens embark on a perilous journey through the twisted library. Alex's tech expertise, Jamie's knowledge of literature, Jordan's logical thinking, and Taylor's imagination become their weapons against the traps and puzzles that guard the Lost Book. The library challenges them at every turn, with rooms that bring to life the scariest aspects of gothic tales, mystery novels, and even epic adventures. They face their deepest fears, learning about bravery, friendship, and the power of stories along the way. In a climactic battle that tests their courage and cleverness, the teens confront the Pagemaster. Using the Lost Book, they craft a new narrative—one where the killer lions are redeemed and become protectors of the library once again. As peace is restored, Theo thanks the teens for their bravery, reminding them that the true power wasn't just in the book, but in their own stories, their courage to face the unknown, and their unbreakable bond. With a roar that echoes through the library, Theo sends them back to their world, just as the tour ends, leaving them with memories of an adventure that no one else would believe. As they exit the Barnaby B. Busterfield III Memorial Public Library, the sun setting in the background, they share a knowing look. Their lives are forever changed, not just by the horror and the thrill but by the realization that within each of them lies the heart of a hero, and within every story, the possibility of a new world.

It's meant to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software. Refactoring can occur at multiple levels of the software stack, from the individual method level up through the architecture of the system. There are numerous types of refactoring, each aimed at addressing specific issues in the codebase, improving code readability, or enhancing its maintainability. Here are some of the most common types: 1. **Code Smell Removal**: This involves identifying and fixing specific problems in the code that might indicate deeper issues (code smells), such as duplicate code, long methods, large classes, or spaghetti code. 2. **Composing Methods**: This involves breaking down large methods (functions) into smaller, more manageable, and reusable ones. It often includes using techniques like Extract Method, Inline Method, and Replace Temp with Query. 3. **Streamlining Conditional Expressions**: Refactoring complex conditional expressions to make them more understandable. Techniques include Decompose Conditional, Consolidate Conditional Expression, and Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses. 4. **Simplifying Method Calls**: Making APIs more intuitive and easier to use through method call simplification. Techniques include Rename Method, Add Parameter, Remove Parameter, and Encapsulate Field. 5. **Dealing with Generalization**: This includes refactoring aimed at improving class hierarchies, using techniques like Pull Up Method, Push Down Method, Extract Subclass, Extract Superclass, and Replace Inheritance with Delegation. 6. **Modularization**: Breaking down a codebase into more discrete, independent modules. This improves maintainability and readability and can make the system more testable. 7. **Encapsulation**: Increasing encapsulation involves moving towards a design where object fields are made private and accessed through getters and setters or by making methods that operate on those fields part of the same class. 8. **Refactoring to Patterns**: Applying design patterns systematically to improve the solution design. It might involve converting ad hoc code structures into formal patterns like Factory, Strategy, or Observer to make the architecture cleaner and more understandable. 9. **Data Class Refactoring**: Addressing issues in classes that primarily hold data but lack substantial methods to operate on that data. Techniques could involve converting these into more fully-featured classes or applying an anti-corruption layer to improve interfacing with the rest of the system. 10. **Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies**: This is a specific kind of problem where every time you make a subclass of one class, you also have to make a subclass of another. Refactoring efforts aim to eliminate this duplication. 11. **Test-Driven Refactoring**: The process of refactoring code guided by tests. Writing tests before refactoring helps ensure the external behavior of the code does not change post-refactoring. 12. **Performance Refactoring**: Refocusing on enhancing the performance of the system by identifying and optimizing bottlenecks in the code. However, this is often approached with caution, recognizing that premature optimization can lead to less maintainable code. Refactoring is an essential part of the software development lifecycle and can greatly enhance the quality, performance, and maintainability of the code. It's often performed iteratively, with small, incremental improvements rather than large, sweeping changes."},{"prompt":"could you write an pg-13 Between the Lions movie","completion":"Title: **\\"Between the Lions: The Lost Word\\"** **Synopsis:** In the heart of a bustling city lies a magical library unlike any other, home to the Liones family - Theo and Cleo, and their cubs, Lionel and Leona. This family of lions is not just any family; they are the guardians of a mystical library where the characters in the books come to life, and adventures leap off the pages. However, tranquility is shattered when a mysterious figure steals the Word Crystal, a powerful artifact that holds the essence of language and storytelling. Without it, words begin to disappear from all the books, threatening not just their magical library but the entire world's stories and languages. **Act 1:** The movie kicks off with a bustling scene of the library, showcasing the lions helping children discover the joys of reading and imagination. Suddenly, everything starts vanishing from the pages, causing chaos. Theo and Cleo immediately realize the severity of the situation and decide it's time to embark on a mission to retrieve the Crystal. **Act 2:** The lions seek the help of Barnaby B. Busterfield III, the wise and somewhat grumpy pigeon, who suggests they must venture into the unknown sections of the library, where untold adventures await. During their journey, the lions meet various characters from different books who have also noticed the disappearance of words from their worlds. These include Sir Percival, a brave knight from a medieval storybook; Moby Duck, a fearless explorer from a seafaring adventure, and Wanda Wonder, a young detective from a mystery novel. Together, they traverse through genres, facing challenges that test their courage, intelligence, and the power of teamwork. Each adventure brings them clues and magical items that aid in their quest, but also brings them face to face with the antagonist, Silencio, a former librarian who believes the world is better off without words, to avoid miscommunications and misunderstandings that lead to chaos and strife. **Act 3:** Their journey leads them to the realization that Silencio's intentions, though misguided, come from a place of deep hurt and isolation. With empathy and the transformative power of storytelling, the lions and their book friends show Silencio the beauty of language and how it connects us, heals us, and enriches our world. In an epic final showdown set in a landscape of fading letters and vanishing words, the lions manage to retrieve the Crystal through understanding and cooperation, restoring words and bringing balance back to the library and the world. Silencio, seeing the error of his ways, helps in the restoration process, finding redemption and a new purpose in protecting the library's stories. **Epilogue:** The library is livelier than ever, with children and characters from the books celebrating the return of the lost words. Theo and Cleo watch proudly as Lionel and Leona learn that with great power comes great responsibility—to protect and pass on the love of reading and storytelling to the next generation. Barnaby B.

It began in the spring of 1989 in the heart of the People's Republic of China, amid the vast expanse of Tiananmen Square, where a gathering for democratic reform swelled into a crusade against corruption and Han supremacism. This movement, profoundly influenced by the enduring spirit of the Xinhai Revolution, sought not merely to reform but to dismantle the entrenched power of the Chinese Communist Party. What emerged was not a moment of historical repetition but a clarion call for an entirely new order. As the call for change reverberated through the streets, it found fertile ground in the memories and aspirations of a nation that once flourished under the rule of diverse empires and republics. It ignited the latent sentiments of regional identity and autonomy, leading to a cascade of declarations of independence from provinces and territories long under the yoke of Han centralism. The ensuing collapse of the Communist regime paved the way for the rebirth of a landscape fragmented yet deeply interconnected by shared history. The Empire of China, reinstituted under the guidance of the Imperial House of Zhu, found itself at a crossroads of tradition and modernization. The revival of the historical state was more than a return to monarchical rule; it signified the resurrection of a multi-ethnic vision under the emblems of the Ming Sun and Moon, and the Five Coloured Flag. This new Empire of China, while rooted in the past, projected a future of inclusivity and cooperation among the mosaic of ethnicities within its borders. Simultaneously, regions that had long sought to preserve their unique cultural and religious identities seized the opportunity to forge their destinies. Tibet reclaimed its theocratic sovereignty, Manchuria and Mongolia restored their khanates, and, in an act of historical rectification, the Kumul Khanate re-emerged in East Turkestan. Each took calculated steps to reinvent their statehood in a balance of ancient tradition and the exigencies of modern governance. Yunnan and the newly formed Cantonian Federation embarked on paths that celebrated their regional identities while aligning with the broader trends of decentralization and autonomy. Further, the re-establishment of the Dali Kingdom and the Tang-inspired sultanate in central China underscored the mosaic quality of the nation's political landscape, each state a tile in the intricate design of a region rediscovering itself. This process of rebirth was not confined to the borders of the old People's Republic. Vietnam, under the influence of nationalist elements from China, witnessed the restoration of its imperial lineage. This revival, however, was imbued with the vestiges of republicanism, creating a hybrid state that sought to reconcile its monarchic past with the practicalities of modern governance. This gesture towards the past, set within the framework of contemporary statecraft, pointed towards a broader trend in the region — the search for identity in the interstices of history and the demands of the present. As these newly reformed states looked towards establishing their place in the international arena, the formation of the East Asian Association heralded a new era of regional cooperation. Inspired by the ethos of ASEAN, this alliance aimed to navigate the complexities of post-Cold War geopolitics, balancing the pressures of globalization with the imperative to preserve sovereignty and cultural integrity. This chapter in history, a saga of revival, reform, and reconfiguration, underscores a critical aspect of the human experience: the perpetual negotiation between tradition and change. The story of post-CCP Asia is not merely a tale of fragmentation but a testament to the resilience of cultural identities and the enduring appeal of self-determination. It is a narrative that challenges us to consider the possibilities inherent in the re-imagination of nationhood and the reconstruction of the political landscape in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: How did the 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests end up escalating into a repeat of the Xinhai Revolution and why were the MSS, PLA, PAP and People’s Police unable to prevent this [the 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests becoming |the 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests | a repeat |the 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests| of the Xinhai Revolution?","completion":"**Chapter Nine: The New Spring - Dawn of the Revolutionary Tide** The period stretching from the 15th of April to the 4th of June 1989 became a crucible for change in the People’s Republic of China, marking the inception of an unparalleled political upheaval that would ultimately dismantle the longstanding rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The echoes of the 1911-1912 Xinhai Revolution resounded once more, not as a mere historical recurrence but as a transformative wave that reshaped the core of Chinese governance and societal structure. This chapter seeks to elucidate the underpinnings of this tumultuous transition, focusing on why and how the Tiananmen Square protests metamorphosed into a full-fledged revolutionary movement, outstripping the capacities of the Ministry of State Security (MSS), People's Liberation Army (PLA), People's Armed Police (PAP), and the People's Police to staunch its momentum. # The Catalyst of Change: Precipitating Factors The genesis of the transformation lay in a confluence of systemic failures, societal discontent, and the burgeoning desire for freedom and dignity. The CCP's steadfast grip on power, underscored by its unwavering advocacy for Han supremacy and rigid authoritarian control, sowed the seeds of dissent across a broad spectrum of the society. This period was underscored by rampant corruption, suppression of political dissent, and an egregious lack of accountability, which, when juxtaposed against the backdrop of economic reforms, highlighted stark inequalities and fomented public ire. # Escalation: Sparks into Flames What began as mourning for the death of a pro-reform official, Hu Yaobang, burgeoned into a mass movement demanding an end to corruption, greater political freedom, and a departure from Han chauvinism. The CCP's initial attempts to suppress these gatherings through censorship and intimidation inadvertently strengthened the resolve of the protesters, transforming the square into a symbol of defiance. The fabric of fear that had long muffled dissent began to unravel, encouraging not only students but workers, intellectuals, and even some members of the military to voice their discontent. # The Revolutionary Tide: Beyond Control As the protests gained momentum, the inability of the MSS, PLA, PAP, and People's Police to contain the uprising was attributed to several critical factors. Firstly, the pervasive sympathy for the protesters' cause among the rank and file of the security forces eroded the CCP's capacity to enforce its will. Incidents of fraternization and outright refusal to engage the protesters undermined efforts to mount a coherent response. Secondly, the sheer scale and geographic spread of the protests exceeded the logistical and operational capabilities of the state's security apparatus. What was initially concentrated in Tiananmen Square rapidly inspired analogous movements across the country, signaling a nationwide clamor for reform that was too widespread to be quashed through force alone. # The Turning Point: A New Dawn The standoff reached its apotheosis with the military's hesitant and fragmented response to the CCP's orders to clear the square, resulting in an inefficacious attempt that only served to galvanize the movement further. The pivotal moment came when a splinter faction within the party, sympathetic to the protesters' demands and disillusioned with the CCP's dictates, facilitated a coup that effectively dissolved the Party's control. This internal fracture within the CCP was emblematic of a broader paradigm shift, mirroring the societal yearning for a political rejuvenation and a departure from autocracy. # Conclusion: The Legacy of the Revolution The legacy of these transformative weeks was a China reborn from the ashes of its authoritarian past. The fall of the CCP catalyzed the disintegration of the centralized Han supremacist state, paving the way for regional autonomy and the revival of historical ethnic identities and administrative structures. The reconstitution of China into a federation of diverse yet unified states underscored a repudiation of monolithic governance, heralding an era of pluralism, democracy, and cultural resurgence. As history marched on, the events from the 15th of April to the 4th of June 1989 remained a testament to the indomitable spirit of a people in pursuit of liberty, justice, and self-determination. This new spring, born of struggle and sacrifice, reshaped not only the political landscape of China but also the very soul of the nation, setting it on an uncharted course towards the future."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: How did the second Xinhai Revolution sparked by 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests end up leading to the disintegration of the CCP’s control over China and the subsequent end of the PRC, with Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan all [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] subsequently [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] breaking away [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] from Han China after the fall of the CCP and PRC to the Second Xinhai Revolution and what was the international response to this [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan breaking away from Han China as a result of the fall of the CCP and PRC to the second Xinhai Revolution caused by the 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests]?","completion":"**Chapter Ten: A Symphony of Independence - The Fragmentation of the People's Republic** # The Unraveling of Central Control The cataclysmic events that unfolded from the 15th of April to the 4th of June 1989, herein referred to as the second Xinhai Revolution, heralded not just the erosion but the complete disintegration of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) iron grip over China. This period, characterized by mass protests and civil unrest, triggered a domino effect that led to the dissolution of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as it was known. The movement, initially centered on demands for corruption eradication, democratic reforms, and the end of Han supremacy, gradually escalated into calls for autonomy and independence across various regions under CCP control. # The Breakaway of Regions The seed of autonomy, once sown, grew into a fervent desire for self-determination across Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi, and Yunnan. The push for secession was fueled by a mix of longstanding ethnic tensions, economic disparities, and the dichotomy between Han-centric policies and regional identities. The weakening of the CCP's authority provided a unique window for these regions to assert their distinct cultural, political, and historical identities. # Guangdong and Guangxi In the South, Guangdong and Guangxi swiftly moved to establish control over their territories, rejecting Han domination and proclaiming their independence. Their close cultural ties and shared history of marginalization under the PRC regime became the foundation of their newfound sovereignty. # East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, and Tibet Similarly, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, and Tibet saw the revolution as an opportunity to break free from the yoke of Han imperialism. Each, leveraging their unique ethnic and cultural composition, rejected the centralized control emanating from Beijing, opting instead for governance systems that reflected their indigenous traditions and values. # Shanxi and Yunnan Shanxi and Yunnan, regions with rich historical legacies and significant ethnic minority populations, also seized the moment to claim autonomy. Driven by a composite of economic disenfranchisement and cultural suppression, they pursued a path divergent from the Han-centric model, aiming to reclaim their historical heritage and forge a new political identity. # The International Response The global community watched in rapt attention as the events in China unfolded. The initial international response was a mixture of cautious optimism and apprehension. With the Cold War still a recent memory, the dissolution of the PRC presented both an opportunity and a challenge on the geopolitical stage. Western Nations Western nations, particularly those with a vested interest in promoting democracy and human rights, saw the disintegration of the CCP's control as a positive development. There was a broad consensus among these nations to support the newly independent states, albeit with a degree of caution, mindful of not inciting further instability in the region. Regional Neighbors China's immediate neighbors reacted with a mix of apprehension and strategic recalibration. The sudden emergence of new sovereign entities along their borders necessitated a reevaluation of diplomatic and security policies. While wary of the potential for regional instability, these nations also saw opportunities for bolstering economic ties and forming new alliances. International Organizations International organizations, including the United Nations, faced the daunting task of navigating the complex process of recognizing the newly independent states. Efforts concentrated on facilitating peaceful transitions, preventing potential conflicts, and ensuring the protection of human rights amid the tumultuous restructuring of the region. # Conclusion: A New Dawn The second Xinhai Revolution, and the subsequent disintegration of the PRC, marked a pivotal moment in the history of modern China. The fragmentation of the state into independent entities catalyzed a radical recalibration of regional power dynamics and laid the groundwork for a profoundly altered geopolitical landscape. This period of tumult and transformation underscored the indomitable desire for self-determination and the resilience of regional identities, setting the stage for a new chapter in the annals of Asian history."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: How did the influence of the Yellow Sand Society spread along with more contemporary Chinese monarchism in post-CCP, post-PRC Han China after the second Xinhai Revolution sparked by 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests and the subsequent disintegration of the CCP’s control over China and the subsequent end of the PRC, with Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan all [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] subsequently [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] breaking away [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] from Han China after the fall of the CCP and PRC to the Second Xinhai Revolution, and why was the last truly Han Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] chosen [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] as the government [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] of independent post-CCP, post-PRC China? Did this have to do with the first Xinhai Revolution’s goal of “Overthrowing Qing, restoring Ming”?","completion":"**Chapter Eleven: From Sand to Throne - The Resurgence of Monarchism in Post-CCP China** # The Yellow Sand Society and Contemporary Chinese Monarchism In the aftermath of the second Xinhai Revolution, which catalyzed the dramatic disintegration of the CCP's control over China, the ideological and political vacuum was palpable. As the erstwhile monolithic PRC fragmented into a mosaic of independent entities, the need for a cohesive identity in Han China became paramount. It was within this crucible of transformation that the Yellow Sand Society, an enigmatic and erstwhile marginal group, began to exert significant influence, intertwining the fate of contemporary Chinese monarchism with the destiny of post-CCP, post-PRC China. The Yellow Sand Society, a mystical and revolutionary organization steeped in the lore of Chinese folk religion and millenarian monarchism, had long advocated for the restoration of the Imperial House of Zhu and the re-establishment of the Great Ming State. Their ideology, rooted in a romanticized vision of the Ming Dynasty's era as a golden age of Han Chinese culture and power, resonated with a populace seeking solidity in the tumultuous seas of change. # The Spread of Influence The spread of the Yellow Sand Society's influence in the nascent post-CCP era was facilitated by a confluence of socio-political tumult and a yearning for national rejuvenation. Their message of returning to a mythical past where China was perceived as strong, unified, and culturally resplendent struck a chord among many. The society's adept use of traditional symbols, narratives, and networks of folk religion allowed it to weave monarchist aspirations into the fabric of the popular consciousness, galvanizing a monarchist resurgence among the Han population. # Choosing the Imperial House of Zhu The choice of reviving the Ming Dynasty under the Imperial House of Zhu as the governing entity of independent post-CCP, post-PRC China was no mere happenstance. It can be attributed to a complex interplay of historical reverence, nationalistic zeal, and the ideological lineage that esteemed the first Xinhai Revolution's mantra of \\"Overthrowing the Qing, Restoring the Ming.\\" This decision was partly a romantic reaction against the centuries of Manchu Qing rule that followed the fall of the Ming Dynasty, perceived by many as a period of foreign domination. The Ming Dynasty, being the last truly Han Chinese monarchy, symbolized a period of ethnic sovereignty and cultural zenith that resonated deeply with the Han populace yearning for a return to greatness. Moreover, the Yellow Sand Society and other contemporary monarchist factions astutely connected the restoration of the Ming to the broader goals of the first Xinhai Revolution. They argued that while the revolution succeeded in overthrowing the Qing, the latter part of its goal—restoring the Ming—remained unfulfilled, presenting a compelling narrative of unfinished national rejuvenation and historical redress. # Impact and Legitimacy The invocation of the first Xinhai Revolution's unfinished goals bestowed upon the monarchist movement an air of historical legitimacy and patriotic duty. This narrative effectively bridged contemporary political ambitions with deep-seated historical sentiments, projecting the restoration of the Ming Dynasty not just as a change in governance but as the fulfillment of a centuries-long quest for national and cultural redemption. # Conclusion: A New Era of Monarchy Thus, in the wake of the CCP's collapse and the subsequent balkanization of the PRC, the combination of historical nostalgia, nationalist fervor, and the strategic cultivation of a monarchist ethos by the Yellow Sand Society facilitated the ascendancy of the Imperial House of Zhu. This marked the beginning of a new era wherein the rekindled flames of monarchism sought to light the path toward unity, identity, and resurgence for Han China in a post-CCP world. The establishment of the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State as the cornerstone of the newly independent China represented more than a political realignment—it symbolized a profound cultural and ideological revival aimed at reclaiming a perceived lost glory. In this light, the rebirth of the Ming Dynasty was not only a return to monarchical rule but an attempt to weave together the fragmented tapestry of Chinese identity into a coherent and majestic whole, echoing the aspirations of the first Xinhai Revolution."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: Why was the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China as the Empire of China formed by Yuan Shikai chosen [the Empire of China] as the means [the Empire of China] by which to restore the Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] through and also as the form [the Empire of China] that the restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] would [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] take after the second Xinhai Revolution sparked by 15 April 1989 – 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square anti-CCP protests and the subsequent disintegration of the CCP’s control over China and the subsequent end of the PRC, with Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan all [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] subsequently [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] breaking away [Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan] from Han China after the fall of the CCP and PRC to the Second Xinhai Revolution?","completion":"**Chapter Twelve: A Monarchical Rebirth - The Beiyang Framework for Imperial Restoration** # The Strategic Selection of the Beiyang Government's Model The historical trajectory that led to the restoration of the Chinese monarchy under the Imperial House of Zhu, following the seismic events of the second Xinhai Revolution, was marked by a deliberate and strategic choice. This choice involved the adoption of the Beiyang Government's model, specifically its brief reign as the Empire of China under Yuan Shikai, as both the mechanism and archetype for monarchical restoration. This decision was intricately tied to the complex socio-political landscape of post-CCP China and the nuanced legacy of Yuan Shikai's ambitions. # The Beiyang Government as a Transitional Model Yuan Shikai's Beiyang Government and his short-lived Empire of China represented a unique amalgamation of monarchical aspirations within a republican framework. In the chaotic aftermath of the second Xinhai Revolution, this model presented an attractive blueprint for several reasons: 1. **Historical Precedence and Legitimacy:** Yuan Shikai's endeavor to establish himself as Emperor was rooted in the rich tapestry of Chinese imperial history. By aligning with this model, the restoration efforts gained a semblance of historical continuity, bridging the gap between the Ming Dynasty and contemporary monarchist ambitions. This precedence lent an air of legitimacy to the restoration efforts, grounding them in a recognized attempt at imperial revival. 2. **Adaptability to Republican Sentiments:** By the late 20th century, the Chinese populace had experienced significant exposure to republican ideas. The Beiyang model, initially conceived within a republican context, provided a familiar framework that could be more readily accepted by a population wary of outright autocracy. This strategic adaptability allowed the restoration movement to navigate the delicate balance between monarchical tradition and modern governance expectations. 3. **Centralization and Unity:** The Beiyang Government was characterized by its strong central leadership under Yuan Shikai. In a period marked by fragmentation and regional independence movements, the restoration of a centralized monarchy under the Beiyang framework appeared as a viable means to re-consolidate national unity. This centrality was crucial for re-establishing the cohesiveness of the Han Chinese identity amidst the splintering of the post-CCP state. # Restoring the Ming through the Beiyang Lens The restoration of the Imperial House of Zhu and the proclamation of a new Great Ming State necessitated a platform that could resonate with both the grandeur of imperial history and the realities of contemporary governance. The Beiyang model offered a historical reference point that embodied the aspirations of monarchical restoration while providing a pragmatic approach to integrating these ideals within a modern state structure. The choice of this model was also a nod to the \\"Overthrowing Qing, Restoring Ming\\" sentiments that had lingered since the first Xinhai Revolution. By utilizing a structure that had once sought to establish a new dynasty, the movement was able to symbolically complete the historical arc of restoration that began with the fall of the Qing. # International and National Implications This approach had significant implications for both domestic politics and international perceptions. Domestically, it facilitated a smoother transition by employing a model that was perceived as both authentically Chinese and adaptable to contemporary expectations. Internationally, the choice signified a conscious effort to signal stability and continuity, assuaging fears of radical shifts in Chinese governance and policy. # Conclusion: A New Ming Dynasty within an Evolved Framework In essence, the adoption of the Beiyang Government model as the pathway to restoring the Chinese monarchy under the Imperial House of Zhu was a strategic maneuver that reflected a deep understanding of the socio-political fabric of post-CCP China. It was an attempt to reconcile the monarchist fervor ignited by the Yellow Sand Society with the pragmatic realities of governing a modern state. This nuanced approach aimed to resurrect the glories of the Ming Dynasty, not through a simple return to the past but through a progressive embrace of a future where imperial traditions and contemporary governance could coexist and flourish. In doing so, it crafted a new chapter in the annals of Chinese history, one where the phoenix of the Ming could rise anew from the ashes of the 20th-century turmoil, ensconced within a framework that had once envisioned a similar rebirth."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: Why did the restored the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China as an restored Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China ruled by the surviving descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as the Chinese imperial family instead of Yuan Shikai’s descendants ruling over post-CCP, post-PRC Han China maintain the name “People’s Republic of China” in English despite being a Empire?","completion":"**Chapter Thirteen: Namenclature of Continuity - The Paradox of the \\"People's Republic of China\\"** In the aftermath of the monumental second Xinhai Revolution, the landscape of China underwent an unprecedented transformation. The resurgence of imperial rule under the auspices of the Imperial House of Zhu, facilitated through the Beiyang Government's framework, presented a unique conundrum in terms of state identity and international representation. Amidst this backdrop of revival and reinvention, the decision to retain the English name “People's Republic of China” (PRC), despite the nation's metamorphosis into an empire, stands out as a significant and deliberate choice. This chapter delves into the multifaceted reasoning behind this paradoxical decision, exploring its implications for both the domestic and international milieu. # Historical Continuity and Legitimacy The preservation of the \\"PRC\\" nomenclature was first and foremost a strategic maneuver aimed at ensuring historical continuity. In a nation deeply rooted in millennia of history, the abrupt jettisoning of a name associated with the country for nearly seven decades could have induced a sense of dislocation and instability. Maintaining the name “People's Republic of China” served as a symbolic bridge connecting the new imperial era with the recent past, offering a semblance of continuity amidst sweeping changes. # International Recognition and Diplomatic Pragmatism On the international stage, the name “People's Republic of China” carried with it significant diplomatic recognition and a plethora of treaties, memberships, and obligations. Navigating the complex web of international relations necessitated a degree of pragmatism. Retaining the established nomenclature minimized potential confusion and disruption, ensuring that the transition did not adversely affect China's standing, agreements, or its role within global institutions such as the United Nations. # Domestic Identity and Inclusiveness The choice also reflected a nuanced understanding of domestic identity politics. The term \\"People's Republic\\" resonated with principles of sovereignty residing with the people - a notion that retained considerable appeal among the populace. By keeping this designation, the restored Empire of China under the Imperial House of Zhu signaled its commitment to serving the collective welfare of its citizens, attempting to transcend the historical elitism often associated with imperial rule. This approach aimed to foster a sense of inclusiveness and shared destiny among the diverse demographics of post-CCP China. # Economic Continuity and Confidence Economically, the PRC had established itself as a burgeoning superpower, with its name synonymous with rapid growth and development. Changing the name could have jeopardized the perception of economic stability and continuity, potentially unsettling markets and international investors. By maintaining the “People's Republic of China” designation, the new regime aimed to project economic stability and confidence, reassuring both domestic and international stakeholders of its commitment to ongoing development and prosperity. # Reinterpretation of the Republic Concept Finally, retaining the name “People's Republic of China” allowed for a creative reinterpretation of the concept of a republic within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. The restored Empire of China sought to present itself as a modernized monarchy that, while drawing legitimacy from historical tradition, was also responsive to the needs and aspirations of its people. In this context, the term \\"Republic\\" was re-envisioned to emphasize a social contract between the monarchy and its subjects, promising governance in service to the public good. # Conclusion The decision to retain the name “People's Republic of China” encapsulates the complexities and contradictions inherent in the process of reconciling a revived imperial heritage with the demands of contemporary governance. This choice underscores a pragmatic approach to statecraft, aiming to balance respect for historical legacies with the need for international recognition, economic stability, and domestic cohesion. Far from being a mere relic of the past, the name serves as a testament to the adaptive strategies employed by the restored Empire of China in carving out its identity within the rapidly evolving landscape of the 21st century."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: And how was the first Republic of China’s and the Empire of China’s shared National Assembly restored through the highest organ of state power of the People’s Republic of China and also the only branch of government in China with all state organs from the State Council to the Supreme People’s Court (SPC) being subservient to it per the principle of unified power, the National People’s Congress with the CCP subsequently being [the CCP] reabsorbed [the CCP] into the YCP soon after, with the YCP replacing the CCP as the dominant political organization [the YCP] in China?","completion":"**Chapter Fourteen: Legislative Continuity and Political Transformation - The Restoration of the National Assembly** In the aftermath of China's dramatic political upheaval, following the second Xinhai Revolution, the nation stood at a crossroads between its imperial past and the modern governance structures established under the People's Republic of China (PRC). One of the most crucial aspects of this transition was the restoration of the National Assembly, a body that once embodied the legislative ambitions of both the early Republic of China and Yuan Shikai's short-lived Empire of China. This chapter explores the intricate process of reconstituting the National Assembly, utilizing the institutional framework of the PRC's highest organ of state power, the National People's Congress (NPC), and the political realignment that followed. # The National People’s Congress: A Framework for Restoration The National People's Congress, established under the PRC, represented the epitome of state authority, overseeing all other branches of the government, from the State Council to the Supreme People’s Court (SPC). The centralized power vested in the NPC provided a critical institutional framework that could be adapted to facilitate the restoration of the historical National Assembly. In the transformative wake of the second Xinhai Revolution, the decision to restore the National Assembly was driven by both a desire to reconnect with historical legislative practices and to establish a unified, representative body capable of addressing the complexities of the newly reformed state structure. To achieve this, the existing machinery of the NPC was repurposed and restructured to reflect the broader, more inclusive representation reflecting the ideals of the restored Empire of China under the Imperial House of Zhu. # The Repurposing of the NPC The process began with a comprehensive reform of the NPC’s operational mechanisms, aiming to incorporate elements of the historical National Assembly while maintaining the integrity and functionality of the state’s highest legislative body. This reformation ensured that the newly restored National Assembly would retain the NPC's authority over other state organs, adhering to the principle of unified power, thereby securing legislative supremacy within the government framework. The newly constituted National Assembly was envisioned as a modern incarnation of its predecessors, embodying the legislative aspirations of both the early Republic and the briefly restored Empire. It was structured to facilitate broader participation, representing the diverse ethnic, regional, and social constituencies of post-CCP China, a move that underscored the commitment to inclusiveness and national unity. # The Political Realignment: CCP’s Absorption into the YCP Concurrent with the institutional reformation was a poignant political realignment. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which had wielded unrivaled authority for decades, was reabsorbed into the Young China Party (YCP), an entity with historic roots extending to the nationalist movements of the early 20th century. This reabsorption marked a significant reshuffling of China's political landscape, with the YCP emerging as the preeminent political organization within the country. This transition was facilitated by a confluence of factors, not least of which was a growing sentiment within segments of the CCP that recognized the need for a political evolution in line with the broader national transformation. The incorporation of the CCP into the YCP represented a merger of ideologies, blending the CCP's socialist principles with the YCP's nationalist and reformist agenda. This amalgamation was positioned as a unifying force, aimed at galvanizing the nation's political energies toward rebuilding and modernization. # The YCP and the Restored National Assembly The YCP, armed with a freshly consolidated political mandate, assumed a leading role in shaping the legislative agenda of the restored National Assembly. This body, reborn from the structures of the NPC, embarked on a mission to lay the legislative groundwork for post-CCP China, navigating the challenges of governance, regional integration, and socio-economic development. This new era of legislative activity underscored the commitment to a governance model that respected China’s imperial heritage while embracing the democratic ideals of representation and accountability. The National Assembly's restoration, facilitated through the existing framework of the NPC and coupled with the political realignment heralded by the YCP's ascendancy, marked a pivotal moment in China's ambitious journey toward a harmonized synthesis of its historical identity and contemporary exigencies. # Conclusion The restoration of the National Assembly through the transformation of the National People’s Congress and the political realignment encapsulates a deliberate effort to rejuvenate China’s legislative mechanisms and political organization. This move not only paid homage to China's rich legislative traditions but also represented a forward-looking endeavor to craft a governance structure capable of addressing the multifaceted demands of a rejuvenated empire, all within the continuum of ensuring stability, prosperity, and unity in post-revolutionary China."},{"prompt":"Resumen y aspectos importantes de la película \\"El código enigma\\"","completion":"\\"El código enigma\\" (título original en inglés: \\"The Imitation Game\\") es una película biográfica de drama y suspenso dirigida por Morten Tyldum y estrenada en 2014.

La película detalla el impacto devastador de la persecución que sufrió debido a su orientación sexual, incluyendo su condena en 1952 por \\"indecencia grave\\" y la castración química a la que fue sometido como alternativa a la prisión. 4. **Narrativa Estructural**: La película emplea una narrativa no lineal, alternando entre varios períodos de la vida de Turing: su adolescencia en la escuela, donde forja una relación cercana con un compañero de clase; sus esfuerzos durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial; y la investigación policial en la década de 1950 que conduce a su condena por homosexualidad. 5. **Reconocimiento y Controversias**: \\"El código enigma\\" recibió críticas generalmente positivas por su actuación, dirección, banda sonora y guion. Fue nominada a múltiples premios, ganando el Óscar al Mejor Guión Adaptado. Sin embargo, la película también enfrentó críticas por su precisión histórica y la representación de ciertos aspectos de la vida de Turing y su trabajo. 6. **Legado de Turing**: Más allá de su valor como entretenimiento, la película ayudó a aumentar la conciencia sobre la vida y el legado de Alan Turing, incluyendo su papel fundamental en la historia de la informática y su trágico destino en manos de las leyes anti-homosexualidad de la época. Su historia ha sido un catalizador para discusiones sobre la justicia y el reconocimiento de las contribuciones de las personas LGBTQ+ en la historia. \\"El código enigma\\" no solo cuenta la historia de un genio atormentado y su maquinaria revolucionaria, sino que también invita a reflexionar sobre temas de justicia, reconocimiento y la valoración de la diversidad humana."},{"prompt":"Cuantas convenciones tenía enigma","completion":"La máquina Enigma, utilizada por los nazis durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial para cifrar comunicaciones militares, es conocida por su complejidad y por el vasto número de configuraciones posibles que ofrecía, lo cual la hacía extremadamente difícil de descifrar. La cantidad exacta de configuraciones posibles (a veces referidas como \\"convenciones\\") dependía del modelo específico de Enigma y de cómo se usaba. Para dar una idea de esta complejidad, aquí están algunos detalles sobre las configuraciones de la más común Enigma militar usada por los nazis: 1. **Rotores**: La máquina tenía tres (o en algunas versiones, cuatro) rotores seleccionables de un conjunto. Cada rotor podía ser colocado en 26 posiciones iniciales. La versión con tres rotores ofrece (26^3 = 17,576) combinaciones iniciales posibles, únicamente por la selección inicial de los rotores. 2. **Anillo de ajuste**: Cada rotor tenía un anillo que podía ser ajustado a 26 posiciones. Esto, combinado con los rotores, incrementaba enormemente la cantidad de configuraciones posibles. 3. **Reflector**: El reflector (o \\"Umkehrwalze\\") también podría ser cambiado en algunas versiones más avanzadas, ofreciendo aún más variaciones. 4. **Tablero de conexión (Steckerbrett)**: Este permitía que pares de letras fueran intercambiadas antes y después del paso del cifrado a través de los rotores, ofreciendo una capa adicional de complejidad. Con 10 cables en uso, hay (150,738,274,937,250) combinaciones posibles de enchufar esos cables. Tomando en cuenta solo algunos de estos aspectos, y asumiendo una Enigma con 3 rotores, sin considerar rotaciones adicionales del rotor durante el cifrado, se estima que el número de combinaciones posibles era superior a (10^{23}). Esta vasta cantidad de configuraciones posibles es una de las razones por las que inicialmente se consideró que Enigma era prácticamente indescifrable. Es importante notar que estas \\"convenciones\\" no se refieren a acuerdos o reglas formales, sino a la configuración técnica y las posibilidades combinadas que Enigma podía ofrecer para el cifrado de mensajes. La extraordinaria tarea de descifrar Enigma, lograda por Alan Turing y su equipo en Bletchley Park, involucró tanto la ingeniería inversa de la máquina como el desarrollo de métodos y máquinas (como la famosa \\"Bombe\\") para manejar estas astronómicas combinaciones."},{"prompt":"Напиши текст на 2500 слов на тему камешек и пушинка.","completion":"История о камешке и пушинке начинается в тихом уголке наивного, чарующего мира, где каждый объект, каждое создание несет в себе уникальную историю, урок или загадку. Камешек и пушинка, на первый взгляд, представляют собой сущности, не имеющие ничего общего: один - символ стойкости и непоколебимости, другой - легкости и свободы. Однако их история говорит о глубже лежащем единстве всего сущего, о взаимосвязи и о необходимости понимания друг друга, несмотря на кажущуюся разнородность. В одной далекой и живописной стране, где деревья шептались с ветром, а реки вели безконечные беседы с камнями, жил-был камешек. Не простой, а особенный. Он лежал среди зеленой поляны, окруженный тысячами других камней, но выделялся среди них своей гладкостью и блеском, словно был отполирован самими облаками. Каждый раз, когда солнечные лучи скользили по его поверхности, в воздухе возникали маленькие радуги, даря радость всему окружающему. Недалеко от этого места, среди облаков, жила пушинка. Она была частью большого и пушистого облака, которое витало по небу, неся дождь и тень, ласку солнца и свежесть ветра. Пушинка всегда мечтала увидеть мир с другой стороны, не с высоты птичьего полета, а ближе к земле, чтобы почувствовать все те чудеса, о которых так много слышала от ветра. Однажды, когда штормовые ветры раздирали небо на части, пушинка оторвалась от своего облака и, словно перышко, понеслась вниз, к земле, танцуя в воздухе и восхищаясь красотами того мира, который она раньше видела только с высоты. Ее путешествие завершилось на той же поляне, где покоился чудесный камешек. Приземлившись неподалеку от камня, пушинка легла на теплую землю, и тогда они впервые увидели друг друга. Камешек, привыкший к одиночеству и молчанию, был удивлен такой легкости и кажущейся хрупкости пушинки. А пушинка, в свою очередь, была очарована красотой и силой камешка, его мудростью и спокойствием. Их первая беседа была краткой, но наполненной любопытством. Камешек рассказал о своих днях и ночах на поляне, о прохладе утренней росы и тепле солнечных лучей. Пушинка же поделилась историями о небесных просторах, о величии грозы и красоте закатов, которые она видела с высоты. С того дня они стали неразлучны. Каждый день они обменивались историями, учили друг друга видеть мир глазами собеседника. Камешек рассказывал пушинке о земле, о камнях и о том, как важно быть крепким и надежным. Пушинка же учила камешек мечтать, показывала ему красоту легкости и перемен, рассказывала о свободе ветра. Со временем, камешек научился видеть красоту не только в статичном и вечном, но и в проходящем и изменчивом. Пушинка, в свою очередь, поняла ценность твердости и надежности, которые до того казались ей совершенно чуждыми. Эта история о камешке и пушинке является напоминанием о том, что всемирная гармония складывается из разнообразия. Каждое существо, каждый объект природы имеет свое предназначение и свою историю. Между небом и землей, легкостью и тяжестью, кажущейся хрупкостью и непоколебимой силой существует мост, по которому можно перейти, если научиться видеть красоту и ценность в отличиях. Камешек и пушинка продолжали жить вместе, обогащая мир своей уникальной дружбой. Они научились ценить каждый момент, проведенный вместе, и каждый раз находили что-то новое и удивительное в привычном окружении. Иногда, в спокойные вечера, когда ветер уносил их истории в дальние края, кажется, что даже сама природа замирает, чтобы послушать их рассказы. Через эту историю о двух таких разных, но таких близких друг другу существах, мы учимся видеть величие в малом, красоту в обыденном и важность сочетания противоположностей. В конце концов, камешек и пушинка напоминают нам, что именно в разнообразии кроется истинная гармония мира, а взаимопонимание и уважение к различиям делают этот мир лучше."},{"prompt":"Write a story, set in the Alpha and Omega (2010) universe, about Claudette, Runt, and Stinky, now adults, learning that Humphrey died of old age, and so Stinky is now the leader of his pack, as Humphrey's successor. Claudette, Runt, and Stinky then realize how cringey and embarrassing their names are, and then joke about how ridiculous and absurd it would be for a pack leader to be named Stinky. The three wolves then begin a quest to have their names changed to something less awkward. After the three wolves have their names changed successfully, Kate (elderly, but still alive) then apologizes for the names...but the trio isn't satisfied. They need an apology from the now-dead Humphrey. So, at night, they find the ghost of Humphrey. They then tell Humphrey about this, and Humphrey apologizes, and says he should have picked better names.","completion":"In the vast wilderness of Jasper Park, the news of Humphrey's passing echoed through the valleys and reached every corner of the forest. Claudette, Runt, and Stinky, now grown wolves with their own lives and stories, gathered to mourn the loss of their beloved father. With his last breath, Humphrey had left behind a legacy, and for Stinky, that meant stepping into the role of pack leader, a task he accepted with both honor and a heavy heart. As the three siblings sat under the moonlit sky, reminiscing about their father and the adventures they had shared, a sudden realization struck them like a bolt of lightning. \\"Stinky... I'm the leader of the pack, and my name is Stinky?\\" he uttered in disbelief, breaking the solemn mood. The realization opened a floodgate of laughter among them, the absurdity of the situation finally dawning on them. Claudette chuckled, \\"Imagine calling for a pack meeting and starting with 'I, Stinky, have gathered you here today.'\\" Runt joined in, adding, \\"And what about us? 'Claudette and Runt, the top advisors.' We sound like characters from a cheesy children's book!\\" Their laughter filled the air, a brief respite from their grief. Yet, beneath the humor lay a shared desire for change. Knowing they could never lead with names that evoked more giggles than respect, they decided it was time for a new chapter. They embarked on a quest to have their names changed, a journey that would take them through trials of self-discovery and affirmation of their identities beyond the shadows of their parents. After days of deliberation and consultation with the elders of the pack, including a somewhat reluctant but understanding Kate, they finally settled on new names. Stinky became Thorn, reflecting his sharp wit and unwavering determination. Claudette chose the name Aria, symbolizing her grace and agility. Runt, who had always felt his name belittled his contributions, proudly adopted the name Talon, signifying his newfound strength and bravery. With their new names, they returned to their mother, expecting a sense of fulfillment. Kate, though elderly, apologized for the names they were given at birth, a whimsical choice that had unintended consequences. However, the trio's satisfaction was incomplete. There was one more apology they needed—the one from Humphrey. Under the cloak of night, beside the very spot where Humphrey had been laid to rest, the siblings called out to the stars, hoping their father's spirit would hear them. To their astonishment, a gentle breeze stirred, and the ghost of Humphrey appeared before them, his eyes twinkling with a mixture of mischief and wisdom. Upon hearing of their plight, Humphrey's spirit couldn't help but laugh, a familiar and contagious sound. \\"Oh, my little ones, I never imagined those names would stick with you for so long. I'm sorry,\\" he said, his voice filled with warmth and regret. \\"I should have picked better names, names that suited the incredible wolves you would grow into.\\" The siblings, now standing before their father's ghost, felt a sense of closure wash over them. They realized that while names are a part of one's identity, it's the actions and the heart that truly define who they are. Forgiving Humphrey, they thanked him for his apology, and with his blessing, they were ready to embrace their roles in the pack and create a legacy far beyond what their names could ever define. As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, the ghost of Humphrey faded away, leaving behind a lingering sense of peace. Thorn, Aria, and Talon stood together, united not just by blood but by a shared journey towards acceptance and redemption. They were ready to lead, to protect, and to honor the memory of their parents, namesake and all, into the future."},{"prompt":"请缩短这个标题：青年立志与共创和谐：国之希望与个人责任","completion":"青年立志共创和谐：国希望与个人责任"},{"prompt":"将“国希望与个人责任”缩短为四字","completion":"国望个责"},{"prompt":"文言文中的“首先”，“其次”，“然后”，“最后”都怎么表示","completion":"在文言文中，表达逻辑顺序的词汇与现代汉语有所不同，以下是常见的文言文中表示“首先”、“其次”、“然后”和“最后”的词汇： 1. 首先：初、始 - 示例：始制其计（首先制定计划） 2. 其次：次、其次 - 示例：次及笄年（其次到了笄年） 3. 然后：乃、然后 - 示例：乃进其言（然后提出他的意见） 4. 最后：终、卒、后 - 示例：终不悔改（最后还是不悔改） 这些词语在文言文中的使用更为灵活和多样。因此，根据上下文的不同，同一个词语有时候可以用来表示不同的逻辑顺序。"},{"prompt":"编写一篇关于恒学实践，自我日新的文段","completion":"时光荏苒，世事变迁，唯有求知与自新，不可息也。古语有云：“温故而知新，可以为师矣。”此言不仅喻示着知识的积累，亦是对恒学不辍之态度的赞赏。在日复一日的学习与实践中，唯有恒学，方能使人日新。 昔孔子曰：“吾日三省吾身”，此乃自我日新之道也。在斯世浮沉，若欲立身处世，成一时之才，必须以恒学为基，以实践为途，方能时刻自省，日益精进。恒学不仅是对知识的不断探索和积累，更是对个人能力、思维方式的不断革新和提升。而实践，则是检验所学真理之唯一途径，亦是自我提升、日新其身的关键所在。 吾人生于世，应常思进取之心，持恒学实践之志。无论是古往今来的圣贤，抑或是身边的普通人，皆能以恒学自强，以实践自新，从而达到自我完善的境界。如同水滴石穿，不积跬步无以至千里，惟有日积月累之努力，方能在知识的海洋里遨游无碍，于人生旅途中自我成就。 故，恒学实践，自我日新，乃达成个人理想与社会责任之核心。愿吾辈青年，能执此心志，不懈努力，以期不负韶华，不负此生。"},{"prompt":"want to make podcast sniffet of 30-60 sec that may gone viral and clips should have climax that tie viewers till end so i am giving transcript of video so give cuttings without changing transcript of about 30-60 sec that have ability to go viral also give rating of viral out of 10 give all possible clips from this \\"How did you get here? I don't know, bro. If 2020 didn't come, I wouldn't be here. I don't have that much of a vacuum in my life. I was working every day. I was working on movies, songs, movies. And I wanted to be a hit in Bollywood. I was trying to prove myself. As soon as 2020 came, I sat down. Are you a part of Illuminati? If you think that I am a part of an organization that is very... If it's a secret, then the feeling is good. I can be a part of a secret society. What did you think of Kylie Jenner? She looked beautiful. I thought she was from Punjab. I didn't know where she was from. I thought she was from Punjab. What happened in your childhood? What was your mindset that you went so deep in life? I was 11 years old when I left home alone. I came to my uncle's village to live with him. He asked me to send him to the city. My parents said, yes, take him. I thought no one asked me. My connection was broken. Not just with my family, but with everyone. Friends, it was a very interesting conversation with a highly requested guest. The guest's name is Diljit Dosanjh. We had a lot of deep conversations with him. Of course, we had a lot of fun. So, please enjoy. It was a lovely episode of TRS. We had a very deep connection. All I want to say is make sure you go watch Chimkila on Netflix after you've seen this epic episode of TRS. TRS This is me holding back. Same to you. How are you brother? I'm very good. How are you? I feel very good sitting in front of you. I also feel very good. First tell me how are you today? I'm very good. I'm very thankful to Maharaj. I'm trying to become a good person. That's it. Why? Does anything change with time? Does a person's character change? That too is not in your hands. I have seen a lot of people who have reached a lot of small mistakes. Which sometimes a normal person may not have reached that much. I don't make such mistakes. So you can reach anywhere as long as you are in this body. So you can make any small mistake anywhere. There is a vacuum inside you. That you can make any mistake anywhere. You have reached anywhere. And I have seen a lot of... There are only a few people who have gone above 99. The rest are taken by the snake dust somewhere. Then zero. Snakes and laddus. It's a very amazing game. Sometimes when I look at the games, I feel that this is as deep as people didn't realize when they were kids. But there are some very deep things in the games. If you make one mistake, you'll slip. Straight to zero. Even if you've reached the end of the runway, and there's only one step that you'll cross, you can still make one mistake to get to zero. What happens in real life? What are the ladders? Opportunity? Sometimes, you deserve it, but you... I don't think I deserve a lot of things. I'll take my own example. I'm not a good singer. Nor did I go to an acting school. There are very good singers who put out perfect sounds. Putting out perfect sounds is a big thing in itself. And... I used to practice a lot. And I think music is very pure. Music is the purest form. And... The people who are in music are blessed, already blessed. No doubt you enjoy music, no doubt you are in the frequency of music. There is music in everything, but when music is made in rag, then it is very amazing. And the people who can perform it very well, they are already doing sadhana, who are doing music. So I don't think I am such a good musician, but still I get opportunities. I have never learned acting that well. Even then I am filming with Imtiaz Ali. I never even thought that I would film with him. This might have happened because of Chamkili. Chamkili gave me a chance. Otherwise, it is not necessary to take Imtiaz Ali's Diljit Ushaanj. They have a lot of other options. Are you a part of Illuminati? If I go to write this, then I will not be able to complete the English spelling. What is Illuminati? That was... Crown Chakra and Third Eye. Not Illuminati. If you think I am a part of a secret organization, then I have a good feeling. I can be a part of a secret society. I don't know how to write Illuminati. If I know the spelling, my spelling will be bad. I don't know what it is. That flow was... The flow of Crown Chakra and Third Eye was not the flow of Illuminati. Music? When we don't know about Illuminati, we don't even know what it is. If someone is there or not. Right? We don't know. And if we get to know easily, then it's a secret society. Those whose words are not secret are a secret society. Right? Aapko lagta hai ki ek rab hai aur ek shaitan hai? Maanta hu ki kuch evil toh rehta hai duniya. Ek onkar. Ek hi hai. Do ho hi nahi sakte bhaji. Do nahi ho sakte hai. Ek onkar ko maanta hu. Ek onkar hi hai bhaji. Bas uske upar nahi hai kuch. Uske upar bilkul nahi hai. Nahi par aap aur second team khadi mat karo. Hai bhi nahi koi. There is no second team. There is only one. It is his form. Like you are his form and I am his form. We all belong to him. There is only one. It is not like the devil's party is different and God's party is different. Then the devil's party is better. I am very strong. If you see it like that, then the devil's party is a very strong party. So you think that... I believe that there is one. There are no two. Is there such a thing in Coachella's backstage as well? No, no. What's up with Coachella? It's a very lovely thing. I mean, they were all our guys. Bangda dancers and we were all enjoying. Did you meet other artists? Yes, I met a lot of people. What do they talk about? Do they ask about India? Yes, they ask about India. What do they ask? Everyone wants to come. All the artists I meet, everyone wants to come to India. You have to start your own podcast. First, learn how to start a podcast. Through one podcast, you can get 20 short form videos for your social media. Real shots. But what you have to learn today is how to start podcasting. Your brother has brought a course for you. Definitely check out B.O.B.' Podcasting 101 course. How was the experience? Very good. Although I wasn't a deserving candidate. Why is that? No, I think so. Okay. It was God's will. It was God's will. But how did you like it? I liked it a lot. I knew it was a big thing. And it was the first time someone was going from India. So it was a big thing for me, 100%. I was like, I'll do my best. Was it a dream? Not a dream, but there was a checklist. Like there are a lot of other checklists. I don't know when. But I don't think I'll die before I turn 84. Until I turn 84. My birth is also of 84. So... All the dramas in life... You have to play all the games and go. All the rides. For every podcast, I watch a lot of interviews of my guests. Really? But the things that the guest has said... I listen to those things too. But where the guest has taken a gap... The spaces... There you get to know more... About someone's character. You are very good in your profession. We have done so many things. Very good. Very good. But you are very deep as compared to the normal person. And I think the success you got is actually because of the depth. Because the ability of an artist, the talent of an artist depends on its depth. This is my opinion. Okay. I would like to ask about your childhood. What happened in your childhood? What was your mindset that you became so deep in life? I was about 11 years old when I shifted from my home. I came to live with my uncle from a village. Which village? Ludhiana. From my village. At that time, he asked me to send him to the city. My parents said, yes, take him. I thought they didn't ask me. Will you go or not? Although my uncle asked, ask him if he will go. Why are you asking them? Take it, take it. I said, man, it's too much. No one asked me. They also thought very well that our son will go to the city from the village. He will learn something. And work. Every parent has the same thing that our child becomes successful. Now that success, what do they understand? That's a different method. What do they understand success? Their life is the same. Their schooling is the same. So they only see success. What did your parents want? That our child should succeed. Earn. So they sent this reason. I thought no one asked me. And like I like Diwali a lot. Was. Is. Say both. I liked Holi a lot. Is. Say this too. So I used to enjoy a lot in the village. When I went to the city. I used to live alone there. There was a small room upstairs. Na TV, na koi koi, kuch nahi. Main school jaata tha, wapis aa jaata tha. Aur meri paas bohot time tha. Aur aise bhi, mobile phone bhi nahi hota tha, ki aap roj phone karo. Aur ye bhi hota tha, ki yaar gaun phone kiya hai, matlab paise lagenge. Yaar gaun se bhi phone aega, to paise lagenge. To ye bhi sochta tha main, to phone bhi nahi karta tha jyada. To 10-11 saal, main mera connection, toot gaya family se. Main apni respect bohot karta ho mom ki, bohot, He is the strongest in our family. And my dad is so lovely. He never said anything to me. He never said anything to me about what I do or what I study in life. He said, you will get a house, you will get food and bread. The rest is your own life. So he is a saint for me. As lovely as his soul is. But my connection broke. Not just with the family, but with everyone. I got disconnected from everything. From the world? I got disconnected from everything. I didn't have any connection with anyone since I was 11 years old. Then what happened? That's it, I'm in front of you. How was your studies? It was good. It wasn't bad. I was a little weak in Maths. Obviously, I was weak in English. I'm still weak. I was good in Punjabi. What was your favorite subject? Punjabi. Why? Are you Punjabi? Something must have changed because of that subject. Like, my favourite subject was probably Maths. You were a very smart guy. No, I mean, I started seeing patterns because of Maths. I saw it all in music. It was music in my life. That's why I'm asking. That because of learning Punjabi language, did something change in music? I mean, what changed in your mind because of Punjabi? What do you think, this language... Is this made by a human being? Is this made by a human being? No. It's just downloaded. No language can make it. No math can make it. It's just downloaded. And all the things that are being downloaded, are being made for you. The things that you have to develop, are being made for you. So thank God I was born in Punjab. Thank God I learned Punjabi. And music came into my life. I was weak in Maths. I was weak in Maths. Even today I am weak. Even today I don't know how to fill the tax. What is happening? All these things. I get confused by these things. Do you like Physics? Who is that? I didn't learn Physics. I didn't learn Physics. I didn't learn Physics. Who is this? I mean, you are of that Universe type. I feel the same. I also feel the same. I feel that everything is inside you. If you close your eyes, everything is there. If you really close your eyes, the universe will listen to you. Just close your eyes and see for yourself. It really listens. 101%. Have you ever broken your heart? No, I have never broken my heart. Never? No, my heart never breaks. Have you ever broken your heart? Yes. So many times. Are you a lover? Yes. No, I'm not a lover. I've never broken my heart. You don't have a lover's heart? I do, but I don't have a broken heart. I mean, you were strong from the start. Yeah, bro. Ever since I told you that I came to the city after 10-11, it's settled. Has life ever broken your heart? No. No? No, never. Have you seen a failure in life? 100%. Who hasn't seen it? Teenage. Yeah, who hasn't seen it? You still see it today. Do you think an artist's life is easy? You're judged on every album, every film. It's not like you got a job. Now, this won't go, you'll go ahead of it. No, my album came out in 18 years. I was doing a wedding show then. I don't know if my teenage came or not, but I'm not such a good artist, I'm telling the truth. I mean, it's God's grace, but I know how much I can do. A person should know his limitations. What are your limitations? Very few. And I'm saying it's very good. I want to be zero. The more I become zero, the better. It's good, I'm not a very good artist. It's also very difficult to carry. It is difficult to carry that. Then you realize that you are good at it. Thank God. Thank you very much. Okay. Rehman sir came on the show. He basically said what you are saying. I asked him how do you listen to such songs? Because you listen to songs in your mind before making them. He said that there should be a beggar mentality. That this is my bowl and the bowl is empty. So in that empty bowl, God keeps giving. That's what will come. How will you receive now? This is the truth. This is what you are saying. This is the truth. How will you receive? You won't be able to receive the full amount. Are you enjoying films the most? Or music? Music. From the beginning. Films are by chance. This wasn't my career. Films are by chance. Are you trying to do deep films? No, I'm not trying. The films that are coming, I'll do them all. The films that come, I'll do one of them every year. The rest is music. I believe that because of Rehman sir's music, people's hearts have changed. That's his specialty. Very good. And the top musicians, I feel that everyone's specialty is that because of their voices, their tunes, people's hearts have changed. So this is the purpose of a musician. Similarly, what is the purpose of films? I don't know my purpose. Why is all this happening? Why am I a singer and why is all this happening to me? And where am I going? I don't know my own purpose. Did you think about it? No. I found out that I can't find out about it. How did you get here? I don't know, bro. I think maybe if 2020 hadn't come, I wouldn't have been so vacuumed in my life. I was working every day, doing movies, singing, doing movies. And I wanted to be a hit in Bollywood. I was trying to prove myself. As soon as 2020 came, I sat down and did everything. You say this in every interview. That after 2020, you'll be a different person. I'm not like that, bro. But what happened? It's very controversial, that's why it's not. I mean, some things should be private. That, I mean, what I used to think, it's the opposite of that. Did it show you anything? I mean, I've been drunk since then, bro. For a second, I'm not out of drunkenness. For a second, I'm not out of drunkenness. I'm telling you this. I mean, how much can someone get drunk on something? I've never been drunk on anything. I haven't drunk, I haven't smoked. I've never been drunk in my life. But there has been such a drunkenness, It's not even going for a second. And as much as I think someone can feel intoxicated, I'm feeling it right now. I'm in a lot of control. I thought now that the films are gone, the songs are gone, everything is gone. What do you mean? I mean, I thought, what happened to me? You mean, you lost interest in it? I felt like everything is gone now. Now, bro, you've taken over. Now, you won't be able to do anything. Now, whatever it is, it is. But it took me two months to settle down. And then I thought, I can work. And I can behave normally like this. I talked to Sarpreet Singh. So I learned a lot from him. And there are some podcasts that stay with me. I think about them. So he said, when we are talking about 10 Sikh Gurus, there was a commonality, which was a jyot. That is, there was an energy transfer in all of us. So I am thinking a lot about that light nowadays. I am also thinking that since my childhood, I have heard stories. And even then I used to feel inspiration. But when you reach the age of 30, you see these things from a different perspective. Because you understand things from an adult perspective. I don't know why but I have been thinking a lot about Guru Gobind Singh Ji. I don't know why. So all my actual Sikh friends, who grew up in Punjab, Feel ki unka Guru Gobind Singh ji ko dekhne ka nazarya halkese alag hoon. Like? Deeper understanding. Zyada understanding. Us perspective se pucha jaunga ki ek... Pehle toh mai chahta ho ki har Bharatiya ko unki kahaani toh at least jaanni chahiye. Jo log ab tak jaanteya par nahi bhi jaanteya. Isle wo wala podcast banaya. Par ek human level par kya jaanna chahiye. Muna apne... Ap mujhe kuch sikha ho. Bohot badi tyag ki bhavna hai bhai. Matlab... When the difference between one and the other ends, that's the thing. That is the quality of God. When everyone is like one. When you sacrifice your head for someone, that is the quality of God. He is God. When you destroy your entire family, that is the quality of God. This is not common. That's why He is God. So this is a very big thing. Obviously SGPC is already working on this. They have more authority, they can say things, they can tell people things. I am not a complete Sikh, so I think I should talk less about this. But the podcast you did was very good. A lot of people should know, a hundred percent should know. And sometimes I feel like, who are we to find out that? This is such a big thing. When it is his wish, he has to do it. If God wants, then all such lights should not be turned on. The life of Gurgobind Singh Ji, he sacrificed his entire family. His father, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, he even gave him his Sees. And the one who brought his Sees, Bhai Jaita Ji, his life was also a great journey. You should definitely read about him, Bhai Jaita Ji. So all these qualities are the qualities of God. It is a very big thing, Bhai Ji. I mean, to sacrifice oneself is a very big thing. It's a big thing to sacrifice your family. That's why He is our Guru. That's why He is our Lord. Okay. You have said in an interview, I think you are talking about your 20s. At that time, you said that when your career started, a song came out and after two years, there was a controversy about that song. Yes, there was a controversy. Then people tried to ruin your name. Well, it happens. I don't complain to anyone. How did you deal with him then? At that time, I was wondering why this is happening. But this is the process. This is the only way. And it's not like they want to hurt you. Or want to ruin you. Or want to ruin your career. No. This is your test. This will definitely happen. It's not their fault. It's just their job. It's your test. It's your test. Where are you standing? What will be your reaction? Your reaction. That will matter. Until then you will have your reaction. Until you understand that I am something. When I am nothing, then there is no tension. Sometimes you come to know that you are playing with me. So this is your test. It is not their fault. It can be anyone. A, B, C, D. It can be anyone. You don't judge them as a person. At any time, it can be anyone's duty that... It's your turn to react to it. And through you too, someone's reaction can be taken in this game. What happened first. What did you learn working in the Hindi film industry? About the world. I believe that if someone has gained so much fame in life, something special happens in the soul. No, I think there are a lot of special souls about whom you don't even know. Through you, something is happening that has to happen. If the world wants to be entertained by you, then that's all that's happening. Everything is special. No one is near, no one is far. And everyone is in his own form. We are all in his own form. There is nothing without him. Everything is special. This was the only specialty of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He made everyone a Singh. Everything is special. Everyone will sit together and eat. No king, no color. Everyone should be equal. Although this is not followed. But this was their motto. Everyone is special. Everyone is a special soul. If someone's duty is not in glamour, then it doesn't mean that he is not special. It's not like that. I believe so. I actually learned more about Urta Punjab from you. Really? Yes. I saw a lot of your interviews in that phase. You had to go as a person. I heard your name, but you had to go as a human being. You were talking a lot in Hindi in that phase, according to me. When you stay here for 2-3 months, then you start learning Hindi. If you don't stay here, then... My friends are all Punjabi, so I speak Punjabi in my routine. But otherwise, you stay here for 2-3 months in Bombay. It's a very tough life. How do people live in Bombay? It's very difficult. What do you think of this city? It's good. But it's very tough. The people who live here are saluted. It's a very tough city. What's the difference? In Bombay as compared to other cities? You should step out a little. I think why are people so stuck? Here? Anywhere. Talk about New York. It's the same. The game is the same. Whether you talk about New York or London. Or Mumbai. It's a very tough city. How are people surviving? It's amazing. The people who do it, it's a salute. The people who stay here. I can't stay here for long. B.K Shivani came on the show. He's a spiritual leader. When she came, I felt guilty. I felt bad about myself about something. The thing was that when I was praying, I didn't have anything to ask for. I wasn't asking for anything specific. And till that point, I always asked for something. Because I had no idea what to ask for. This is a very good stage. I didn't know that at that time. So I thought it was bad. This is a very good stage. I feel that you had reached there a long time ago. And a lot of people want to reach there. That you are submitting yourself in a way. I only regret one thing. That I didn't start yoga since childhood. I regretted this after 2020. I felt that no one told me. I mean. Yoga is a miracle. And it is a huge blessing. Yoga is a huge power. I felt that it was not my parents fault because it was not in their life. And there was no culture in our village. It was not culture at all. And when we used to watch yoga, we used to think that Ramdev ji is doing yoga. This is stretching. People are doing stretching. Yoga is not stretching. Yoga is the art of living an actual life. As you are in this profession, you know a lot about this profession, about podcasting. If I ask you this, you will get this view. So yoga is the life in which you are. Yoga starts in this life. And suppose you have started the podcast and you have not given the mic and you have not put the wire. And you are doing the podcast. Meaning you are speaking and no one is listening to you. This is the life without yoga. And I regret that the culture around me didn't even tell me about yoga. Where did you hear it from? It came. From the world? No, it came. Yoga came. Do you practice? I don't know what I do. Yoga came. Do you sit to meditate? I don't sit to meditate. If someone told me, that I never do yoga because I didn't know about it. Maybe I still don't know, but I don't do yoga. Yoga has come and yoga is happening. That's all I can say. Okay. So, you want to give the message that you should do yoga? Bro, I 100%. I mean, the way I regret, the new generation, don't call it a message. In English, it's called a message. A message is also a message, right? Request it. It will be better. Hmm. That there is nothing greater than yoga. If you can, then please teach your children yoga. Yoga is life. That is life. Everything will start from there. As an artist, you changed because of yoga? 100%. I changed everything. As an artist, leave it. I changed everything. This menu is different. After yoga. Did you start before 2020? No. I had zero knowledge about yoga. Even now, call it zero. For me, it was stretching. Like you were saying, this is how it is. Stretching is not yoga. Yoga, if you have a lack of words, you can use the word spiritual. Whatever heavy words you want to use, yoga is above all of them. At some point, I think this would have been a proper method. But today, it's over. We didn't get it in life. Neither in school, nor did our teachers ever tell us. It's not the family's fault, they never told us. There was no culture in yoga. No one told us. And I regretted it. That in 2020, if I want to race a supercar, I should have learned the cycle. I should have started with the basics. Yoga is a rocket. It will take you there. But you should be ready. What was the most intense experience on stage? Do you remember any? Is there any such experience? Yes. Music is a drug. You let yourself go a little and then you feel. But sometimes people are not ready to see you for that. You have to control. There is so much flow that you have to control yourself. Stay in control. There's a lot of flow in music. Why? What happens if you don't control it? The people you're showing, they're probably not ready. Do you feel the consciousness of the audience? Audience? 100%. That's when there's music. They're also in that same vibration. That's the vibration of music. When you're in a concert, when you're performing in a stadium or arena. That's what drives the music. For them and for the artist as well. The first thing lots of people said is performer. One of the best performers. Maybe some people have also said that you are a GOAT performer. Greatest of all time performer. I believe that even the best performers come out of the flow stage. So what is going on in your mind? When you are in front of such a big audience. What is going on? Because if you look at it in one way, you are controlling the energy of the entire audience. What do you want? What do you want for the audience? It is definitely that the person who is coming after buying your ticket, He takes out money from that and buys a ticket. And he wants the artist to look at him and smile at him and enjoy his music. So his smile, his happiness, when he goes out of the arena, he goes with him. And he thinks that the money I have spent on this guy is worth it. I enjoyed it a lot. It was the best moment of my life. Do you have a favorite song of your own? Something happens to you while you perform. When the first tune of the music plays, something happens to me. There's a track called Aar Naanak Paar Naanak. If you haven't listened to it, or if someone has, it's mine. I think it was made. For what reason? Maybe it had to be made through me, that's why it was made. I don't have a role in it. I don't have a hand in it. Things can be made through you. So it was like that. Have you ever been starstruck by meeting someone? Did something happen to you? The first day of the Hindi film shoot was with Kareena Kapoor ji. For me, it was like, I've seen this and that, I don't know what to do with these days. It was a good moment. What did you learn from that experience? She said a very nice thing. The staff with her came to me and said, my staff is a big fan of yours and wants to take a photo with you. It was a very big thing for me. I never thought that I would ever meet her in real life. Maybe that's why they said that our scene hadn't started yet. So the big artists cool you down when you're working with them for the first time. Were you nervous? I wasn't nervous. I was like, your Kareena Kapoor. That was the feeling. So they said a very nice thing. I understood when they asked me why I said that. To make the person feel. And she said a very good thing. I liked it. How does it feel to work with an international artist? It's great. I like it. Everyone is a human. Everyone is stuck in some sort of cycle. Everyone has their own demons. If I see someone's face for two minutes, I start seeing my own face. Meaning? If I keep looking at you for two minutes, I'll feel like I'm looking at myself. And then I start seeing my own shortcomings. If I am looking at this brother, I will look at him for 2-3 minutes and then I start seeing my own face. And I feel that this is me. This item that I am doing in front of me, I am shooting myself. There is a very deep religious thing that after a point a person starts looking at himself in everything. Boundaries melt. Are you saying this? If you say it deep and dharmic, it will be a big deal. If I say it normal, I even look at someone's photo. So I feel that this is me. This is me. Anyone's. Memes can also be made on this. It's very good content. Make a meme. Good content has also come. But this is the truth. Do you consume memes? I laugh a lot. That's why it's okay. I laugh a lot. Hmm. What did you feel when you saw Kylie Jenner? I felt like Punjab. I don't know where I felt like Punjabi. I felt like Punjabi. I felt like a Punjabi girl. I don't know where she is from. What is her speciality? Bro, there is one thing. There is one thing. There can be a lot of hate. She has made her life better. Look at the net worth of the person you're talking about. Whoever it is, whatever it is. Whatever he wanted, he took it. Whatever it is, he took it from a stand. He also made a product of his own. He also has a good net worth. So we don't blame anyone, everything is good for us. But I think the face looks like a Punjabi type, I think it looks like a Thambadi. Hold on to the vibe. No, I don't know what kind of person he is. Immediately. Yes, yes. After seeing it? Yes, yes. Have you improved this skill or was it there before? No, it came just now. After 2020. Before that, you were learning about the world. I was asleep. Say this, my life got wasted. 35 years got wasted. What you said about yoga, this is also a life skill. To check others a little bit. Yes. I feel, after a point. It's a self-protection skill. Let's call it protection. It's not protection? No, everyone is the same. It's the same with you and me. The way I think or the way you think. You are saying something. It is not necessary to connect with someone. Right? So then some people get hurt. You are sharing this career learning. It has happened with you before. That you said something and someone took it wrong. This is fine. Thank you. Now this is going straight. When it was published in the newspaper, then something else was published. That is, the person says something else, the context is different, then something else is published. I want to ask something about Chamkila. There is a slightly different question. Again, I will ask this with a lot of respect. I have asked Vicky Kaushal Bhai about the Sam Bahadur film. I asked him that it was Sam Manikshaw's biopic. Did Sam Manikshaw's energy feel on set? He said yes. Do you know what I am going to ask you? Did Chamkila Sir's energy feel? You are playing the character of Little. Their life story is very peculiar. Those people who don't know about their life. You should say what happened in their life in the end. Yes, everyone knows. On stage. Before the stage. Before the stage. Before the stage, they were killed. The stage was about to start. Generally, their life reached icon status. 100%. Chamkila is an icon. 100%. Now I'll ask you. Did you feel energy on set? 100%. Do you want to share anything after that? I don't know if it will be right for people or not, but I feel 100% energy. What I feel now is the role that I have played. Earlier I used to think that acting is okay, I will do it, there is no tension. For example, I did a film on Jaswant Singh Khalraji. I went to the set, I thought I will do it, it is not a big deal for me. I never took acting as I have to do it today. I never had such thoughts in my mind. I went to the set the first day and I said the dialogue and I didn't feel it. I didn't feel it. I felt guilty all night. I felt like I didn't go with the respect that I'm characterizing. The second day when I was getting ready again, I said, you do it yourself. No, I can't do it. From the second day, the director was caught. Same Chamkilla. We shot where Chamkilla was killed. Imtiaz sir shot at the same place. Exactly at the point where he fell when he was shot. And when I fell, you were also in my hand. You too have a wire. So I fell, you too have a wire on me here. And as soon as I fell, my hand is visible and blood is visible. On the ground. I fell down. I felt it all at once. I was the blood of this spark. I can feel it 100%. They were there. They were there at that moment, 100%. It's not like the slow moment that the camera shoots. What do they call it? High point? High rate? Whatever they call it. The camera man knows it's high speed. It was a camera that shoots very slow. When the bullet hit, I was falling. As soon as the blood fell on the ground, I remembered Chamkila. After that, I don't remember what happened. I don't know. It was cut after that. But 100% I felt that Chamkila's blood was falling at this very place. This was the podcast. Very good podcast. I hope some controversial, some spice, something like that came out. As a bro, can I say something? Please. I'll say two things. Please. First, I'll say something a little selfish. Next time, we'll talk again. At least, we'll talk again. Okay. Next time, I'll talk to you in my studio. Because the energy there is very different. Really? Yes. So, I feel that different things will come out. Okay, sure. So, this is a selfish request. 100%. Now, one thing. And I'll have a little kitchen. Yes. Kitchen? Yes. I will cook food for you too. I cook good food. What are you good at cooking? I cook everything. I cook everything except puddu. The world is full of puddu. Where did you learn to cook? This too wasn't in 2020. I was stuck in Bombay. And my sister didn't cook. So I thought I have to learn my art. One or two more. I learned from YouTube. Salt and pepper. Boy, I know how to cook very well. I don't know how to cook half of someone's food. I know how to cook very well. Do you know Chef Harpal Sokhi? I've heard his name. I'm a YouTuber chef. One of the first YouTubers on YouTube. I learned from him. You know how to cook? Yes. My channel started as a cooking channel. Really? Yes, a long time ago. Nine years ago. I'm not talking about a pro. No, no, no. I know how to cook for myself. But I think I'm good at it. What do you make? Whatever you want to make. What's your favorite? Whatever you want to make. First of all, I have to wear a tomato. Punjabi, but Indian. Same, same, same. They don't ask me that. I make whatever I want to eat. Same, same. I don't make roti. Then? Chawal. Okay. Always? It's okay. Okay. I eat bread and bread with it. I prefer roti to kati. I eat sabzi and dal. Hmm. Chal bada maa ke dekhye kaun, bada bada badiya. Aapki team ko khilayenge fir. Okay, done. Done. Okay. But maa kuch kena chahta hoon. I know ki aapko yeh shahad pata hoga, fir bhi maa ek baad dohra honga. Par har podcast ke baad kuch rub off ho jaata hai, guest ki wajah se, kyunki itni deep baate ho rahi hai. Aap sir maane detachment aur bhi zyada sikhi hai. Ki detach kaise ho jaata hai. Ki kuch bhi bura nahi hai, kuch bhi acha nahi hai. Bas drama chal raha hai. I hope ki audience ne bhi yahi sikha hai. So, actually what I want to say to you, I am not able to say it now. I am not getting the words. But basically, I just want to say thank you. And thank you for your time also. No, no, it was your thought. But it was a lot of fun. I mean, I asked you my own questions. And I don't get the chance to ask my own questions. I don't know if the audience will like this podcast or not. But it was a very raw conversation for me. Other than few moments. But mostly, it was just my own talks. You have to do some things for the content. But when you get a chance to do some things for your heart, it's the best day for me. So thank you. Very memorable day. I also liked it a lot. You are doing a very good job. And a lot of love and respect to your entire team. Thank you. Thank you, brother. Lots of love. So friends, this was today's conversation. Tell us in the comment section how you liked today's conversation. Because some people There are people who have 10, 20, 30 podcasts hidden in them. Diljit Dosanjh is one of those people. He is a special soul. He already knew it. After talking to him, I felt with more depth that this person is a special soul. That's all I will say in today's outro. Definitely go and watch Chamkeela on Netflix. And Ranveer and the team will be back very soon with another episode of TRS. We'll be right back.","completion":"Selecting 30-60 second clips that have the potential to go viral from a long, diverse, and rich conversation is based on identifying moments that are either highly emotional, surprising, deeply insightful, or funny.

Камешек, суров и непоколебим, лежал на обширной равнине уже многие века. Его поверхность была потрескавшейся от безжалостного палящего солнца, а края затупились под неумолчным напором ветров. Несмотря на это, камешек гордился своей стойкостью и твердостью, и с пренебрежением смотрел на все, что казалось ему непостоянным и слабым. Пушинка была простым созданием этого мира — легкой, незначительной, словно крохотный клочок облака, упавший на землю. Она была посажена ветром рядом с камешком одним весенним утром, когда природа пробуждалась от зимнего сна. С самого начала их непростых взаимоотношений камешек с презрением относился к пушинке, считая ее слабой и недолговечной. \\"Ты лишь игрушка ветра, брошенная здесь до следующего порыва,\\" - говорил камешек, гордо возвышаясь над мелкой, бестелесной пушинкой. Пушинка, однако, не унывала. Она видела мир иначе, чем ее сосед. Для нее каждый порыв ветра был приключением, каждый луч солнца — теплом, и каждый дождь — освежающей ванной. \\"А что ты видишь со своего места, камешек?\\" — спрашивала она с любопытством. Но камешек каждый раз отвечал одно и то же — что его место неизменно, взгляды тверды, и он не жаждет ничего нового. Прошло много времени. Ветры несли пушинку туда-сюда, даря ей возможность видеть далекие земли, встречать новых друзей и переживать невероятные истории. Однако, как ни странно, все эти путешествия приводили ее обратно к камешку. С каждым возвращением пушинка делалась мудрее, полнее переживаний и впечатлений, которыми спешила поделиться с камешком. Камешек же, в свою очередь, оставался на месте, но с каждым рассказом пушинки его сердце становилось чуть мягче, а мысли — чуть шире. Он начал задаваться вопросами о том, что за пределами его неподвижного мира, начал мечтать, как бы это было — увидеть рассвет с вершины горы или ощутить легкий прикосновение морской волны. В конце концов, камешку стало очевидно, что хотя он и обладает физической неподвижностью и крепостью, пушинка же обладает душевной свободой и гибкостью. Силой, которой не владеет камень — способностью путешествовать, видеть и чувствовать более широко. Камешек осознал, что мир не ограничивается его узким взглядом, и что каждое создание несет в себе нечто ценное, чем можно и нужно восхищаться. В ту ночь, когда звездное небо особенно ярко сияло над прериями, камешек, впервые за многие годы, пожелал пушинке доброй ночи. Он понял важность своей спутницы, как символа непредсказуемости и красоты жизни. История о камешке и пушинке — это история о стойкости и гибкости, о силе и красоте. О том, как два казалось бы совершенно разных существа обогатили жизнь друг друга, научились ценить момент и поняли, что каждое, даже самое незначительное существо или явление, несет в себе глубину и значимость. Так, камешек и пушинка продолжили свое существование, слушая шепот ветра и созерцая бескрайние просторы вместе, обогащая друг друга удивительными рассказами о жизни, мире и вселенной, вечно напоминая о важности осознанности, гибкости и открытости миру."},{"prompt":"유명한 명언을 알려줘","completion":"물론이죠. 다양한 분야에서 영감을 준 유명한 명언들이 많은데, 여기 몇 가지를 소개해 드리겠습니다: 1. \\"삶이 그대를 속일지라도, 슬퍼하거나 노하지 말라! 우리의 마음속 깊은 곳에서 조용히 기다리며 행복의 시간을 믿으라. 기쁨의 날이 반드시 올 것이다.\\" - 알렉산드르 푸쉬킨 2. \\"당신이 할 수 있다고 믿든 할 수 없다고 믿든, 믿는 대로 될 것이다.\\" - 헨리 포드 3. \\"인생에서 가장 중요한 일은 자신이 언제나 변할 수 있다는 것을 알고 있는 것이다.\\" - 레프 톨스토이 4. \\"당신의 시간은 한정되어 있습니다. 그러므로 그것을 남의 인생을 살아가는 데에 낭비하지 마십시오. 견해의 감옥에 갇히지 마십시오. 그것은 당신의 마음의 소리를 따라 살기 위해 다른 사람의 생각의 결과에 사는 것을 의미합니다.\\" - 스티브 잡스 5. \\"두려움을 느끼는 것은 정상이지만, 그것에 굴복해서는 안 됩니다. 가장 용감한 사람도 두려움을 느낍니다. 하지만 다른 누구도 아닌 바로 그 두려움에 맞서 싸우는 것이 그를 용감하게 만듭니다.\\" - 넬슨 만델라 6. \\"내일은 우리가 어제에 대해 오늘 걱정했던 날이다.\\" - 마크 트웨인 이 명언들이 여러분에게 영감을 줄 수 있기를 바랍니다."},{"prompt":"고사성어 알려줘","completion":"고사성어는 중국 고대의 역사, 문학, 철학 등에서 유래한 사자성어로, 교훈이나 지혜를 짧고 굵은 표현으로 전달하는 역할을 합니다. 여기 몇 가지 유명한 고사성어를 소개합니다: 1. 군계일학(群鷄一鶴): 무리 속의 닭들 중에서 한 마리 학. 평범한 사람들 사이에서 유독 뛰어난 사람을 가리킵니다. 2. 고진감래(苦盡甘來): 고생 끝에 낙이 온다는 뜻으로, 어려움을 겪은 끝에 즐거움이 온다는 의미입니다. 3. 절개부동(節槪不動): 결코 변하지 않는 굳센 의지를 가리킵니다. 원칙이나 정의를 위해 굽히지 않는 태도를 말합니다. 4. 이효상박(以孝上報): 부모에 대한 효도로 하늘에 감사함을 보고한다는 뜻입니다. 효도가 가장 큰 덕목 중 하나로 여겨진다는 의미를 담고 있습니다. 5. 난형난제(難兄難弟): 형제 간에 서로 뒤지지 않는다는 의미로, 비슷한 수준의 사람들 사이에 경쟁이 치열함을 비유적으로 나타냅니다. 6. 백지장도(白紙張圖): 흰 종이 위에 그림을 그린다는 뜻으로, 처음부터 시작한다는 의미입니다. 어떤 일을 전혀 새로운 마음가짐으로 시작하거나 기획하는 상황을 나타냅니다. 7. 일취월장(日就月將): 날이 갈수록 월이 갈수록 발전한다는 의미로, 계속해서 발전하고 성장한다는 긍정적인 의미를 담고 있습니다. 이처럼 고사성어는 단순한 사자성어를 넘어서 깊은 뜻과 지혜, 가르침을 담고 있어 다양한 상황에서 인용되곤 합니다."},{"prompt":"관용어 알려줘","completion":"관용어는 단어나 구의 문자 그대로의 의미가 아니라 전통적으로 정해진 특정한 의미로 사용되는 표현입니다. 한국어에는 많은 관용어가 있으며, 일상 생활 속에서 자주 사용됩니다. 여기 몇 가지 예를 들어 보겠습니다: 1. **눈에 넣어도 아프지 않다** - 매우 사랑스럽고 귀하게 여긴다는 의미입니다. 주로 자녀나 애인 등을 향한 깊은 애정을 표현할 때 사용됩니다. 2. **입에 발린 소리** - 진심이 담기지 않고 아첨하거나 남을 기쁘게 하려고 하는 말을 뜻합니다. 겉으로는 칭찬하는 것 같지만 실제로는 진심이 없는 말을 가리킬 때 사용합니다. 3. **배보다 배꼽이 더 크다** - 본래의 목적보다 부수적인 것이나 부가적인 것이 더 많은 비용이나 노력을 요한다는 의미입니다. 일이 예상외로 번거롭거나 비용이 많이 드는 상황을 설명할 때 쓰입니다. 4. **벼룩의 간을 쪼다** - 매우 작거나 하찮은 이익을 탐한다는 의미로, 지나치게 인색하거나 사소한 것에까지 집착하는 태도를 비판할 때 사용됩니다. 5. **호랑이도 제 말하면 온다** - 어떤 사람이나 일을 이야기하고 있을 때 그 사람이나 일이 갑자기 나타나는 경우에 쓰는 말입니다.

It is imperative to approach this subject with sensitivity and acknowledgment of the differing perspectives within Islamic tradition. The provided texts mention that Abu Bakr sent Umar ibn al-Khattab with the intention of enforcing the allegiance (Bay'ah) from those who were initially reluctant, which includes Ali (AS), Abbas, Zubair, and Sa'd ibn Ubada, who were staying in Fatima’s house. In \\"Al-'Iqd al-Farid\\" by Ibn Abd Rabboh al-Andalusi, it is disclosed that: \\"The ones who refrained from pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr were Ali, Abbas, Zubair, and Sa'd ibn Ubada. As for Ali, Abbas, and Zubair, they stayed inside Fatima's house until Abu Bakr sent Umar ibn al-Khattab to bring them out of Fatima’s house. He instructed him: if they refuse, then fight them. Umar approached with a flame intending to set their house on fire when Fatima met him and said, 'O son of Khattab! Have you come to burn our house?' He replied, 'Yes, or [else you must] enter into what the nation has entered.'\\" - (Reference: \\"Al-'Iqd al-Farid\\" by Ibn Abd Rabboh, Volume 3, Page 63, Egyptian edition) Similarly, the historian Abu al-Fida, Ismail ibn Ali ibn Mahmoud, reports a narration from Qadi Jamal al-Din and Imam Ibn Abd Rabboh which aligns with the account mentioned above: \\"Then Abu Bakr sent Umar ibn al-Khattab to Ali and those with him to bring them out of Fatima’s house, may Allah be pleased with her, and said: if they refuse, then fight them. Umar approached with something of fire intending to set the house on fire. Fatima, may Allah be pleased with her, confronted him and said, 'Where to, O son of Khattab? Have you come to burn our house?' He said, 'Yes, or [else you must] enter into what the nation has entered.'\\" - (Reference: \\"History of Abu al-Fida\\", Volume 1, Page 156, Egyptian edition) These accounts reflect a contentious period in the early Islamic community following the Prophet Muhammad’s death, leading to deep and longstanding divisions. The historical narrative surrounding the event is complex and interpreted differently within various Islamic traditions. Sunni scholars often contextualize these reports differently or question their authenticity, while Shia tradition holds these events as foundational grievances. It's crucial to approach these sensitive topics with a deep understanding of their historical, religious, and emotional significance to foster dialogue and respect among different Islamic schools of thought."},{"prompt":"a beautiful woman wearing white fur posing around an outdoor table in front of a coffee shop, in the style of natalia rak, focus on joints/connections, exaggerated facial features, duccio, dark brown and light blue, webcam photography --ar 94:125 --stylize 750, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, do not include the flags starting with '--' like (--ar --stylize) and its value, dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","completion":"Elegant Woman in White Fur by Coffee Shop Outdoor Table, Duccio-Inspired Art with Exaggerated Features"},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Elegant Woman in White Fur by Coffee Shop Outdoor Table, Duccio-Inspired Art with Exaggerated Features.

The Rebirth of a Nation As the crimson dawn of 15 April 1989 broke over the heart of Han China, an air of unease, pregnant with the promise of change, enveloped Tiananmen Square. Here, in the shadow of monuments chronicling centuries of imperial glory and revolution, a new chapter of defiance was about to be written. The populace, disenchanted with the rampant corruption and stifling control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), initiated a series of protests that would indelibly alter the course of their nation’s history. This was not merely a clamor for reform; it was the precursor to a revolution that echoed the spirit of 1911, aiming to unshackle the nation from the iron grip of a modern-day dynasty. The demands of the demonstrators were clear and resonated throughout the vast expanse of the PRC: an end to CCP corruption, democratic reforms, freedom of the press, speech, and association, social equality, and democratic input on economic policies. Yet, the ruling regime, ensconced in their stronghold of Greater Manchuria, responded not with dialogue but with the cold steel of oppression. As tanks rolled into Beijing between April and June 1989, the echoes of defiance were met with a massacre that stained the square with the blood of the hopeful. However, unlike the faded insurrections of the past, the brutal quelling of the protests did not extinguish the flames of rebellion. Instead, it ignited a fervor that swept through Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi, and Yunnan. This was not merely a protest; it was the modern incarnation of the Xinhai Revolution, with the CCP finding itself in the role once occupied by the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro, and the sprawling PRC empire standing in for the once-mighty Great Qing. The CCP’s reign, much like the Qing’s, crumbled under the weight of its own corruption and the unyielding spirit of those it sought to subjugate. Province by province, the dominion of the party fractured, giving way to the resurgence of a nation long thought lost to the annals of time. In the wake of the CCP's downfall, the disparate regions broke away, carving out their futures from the ruins of the old empire. Central to this rebirth was the restoration of the Beiyang Government-era Republic of China, albeit in a guise that few could have anticipated. The legacy of Yuan Shikai's short-lived Empire of China, marred by ambition and betrayal, was reborn under the most unlikely of banners - that of the Imperial House of Zhu. The Ming dynasty, once eclipsed by Manchu conquerors, found its phoenix in the form of the Yellow Sand Society, a group whose roots in militant self-defense, tax resistance, and romanticized monarchism traced back to the twilight years of the Qing. The Yellow Sand Society, having survived CCP attempts at suppression in 1980, emerged from the shadows as architects of the new era. Their unwavering commitment to restoring the glory of the Ming facilitated the reenthronement of the Imperial House of Zhu, marking an unprecedented return to monarchy in a land where republicanism and communism had reigned for nearly a century. In the newly reconstituted Empire of China, the society's influence was evident in every facet of governance and culture. The ideals of the Yellow Sand Society - a blend of ancient monarchist principles and modern aspirations for social justice - became the foundation of this new-old empire. Tax reforms prioritized the alleviation of peasantry burdens, while a revamped military doctrine emphasized self-defense and the protection of cultural heritage over expansionism. As the 21st century dawned on the Empire of China, the world watched with bated breath. Here was a nation that had traversed the spectrum of governance, from imperial rule to republic, through the dark valley of totalitarianism, and back to monarchy. Yet, this was not a simple return to the past; it was a reimagining of tradition in the context of contemporary values. The Empire of China stood as a testament to the resilience of its people and the enduring allure of their cultural legacy, a beacon of what could be achieved when the past and present melded to forge a future unbound by the constraints of history."},{"prompt":"Напиши текст на 3000 слов на тему камешек и пушинка.","completion":"Создать текст на 3000 слов на запрос \\"камешек и пушинка\\" в формате одного сообщения затруднительно из-за ограничений платформы, но я могу предложить вам краткое эссе на эту тему. Затем, если будет желание, можно расширить и развивать историю в разные стороны, добавляя детали, описания, диалоги и размышления. --- # Камешек и Пушинка: Путешествие к самопознанию В далёкой стране, на опушке величественного леса, где солнечные лучи едва пробивались через плотную крону деревьев, лежал маленький, но гордый камешек. Его поверхность была гладкой от многих лет, проведённых под натиском ветра и воды. Камешек привык к своему одиночеству и тяжёлой участи — быть вечно прикованным к земле. Однажды, когда бриз легко колыхал листья, к лесной опушке поднеслась нежная пушинка. Она беззаботно плыла по воздуху, играя с лучами солнца и танцуя в ритме природы. Пушинка была лёгкой и свободной, в отличие от камешка, заключённого в свою твёрдую оболочку. Пушинка приземлилась рядом с камешком, и начался их неожиданный разговор. Камешек рассказал о своих долгих годах в одиночестве, об утрате надежды на перемены и о том, как он завидовал облакам и птицам, свободно перемещающимся по небу. Пушинка же поделилась своей историей о путешествиях, о том, как она видела коралловые рифы, пустыни и заснеженные вершины. \\"Как же я хотел бы быть похожим на тебя, — вздохнул камешек, — свободным и лёгким. Мне кажется, ты никогда не чувствуешь грусти или одиночества.\\" \\"О, но это не так,\\" — ответила пушинка, — \\"Быть пушинкой не всегда легко. Да, я видела много удивительных мест, но мне часто приходится бороться с сильным ветром, сталкиваться с дождём и грозами, не имея возможности укрыться. Иногда я чувствую себя такой неуловимой и ненужной.\\" Этот разговор открыл камешку другую сторону свободы, которая была не так прекрасна, как ему казалось. С другой стороны, пушинка поняла ценность устойчивости и надёжности, которыми обладал камешек. Они узнали, что каждый из них вносит свою уникальную лепту в красоту мира, и что у каждого свои радости и испытания. \\"Может быть, важно не то, кем мы являемся на поверхности, — предположил камешек, — а то, как мы принимаем свою судьбу и что мы делаем, чтобы придать смысл нашему существованию.\\" \\"Да, и важны друзья, которые могут открыть тебе иные перспективы и помочь принять себя,\\" — добавила пушинка, касаясь камешка своей мягкой стороной. С тех пор камешек и пушинка стали неотъемлемыми друзьями. Они научились находить радость в малом — в тепле солнца, в каплях утренней росы, в пении птиц. Пушинка иногда улетала, но всегда возвращалась к своему другу, чтобы поделиться новыми историями. А камешек, хотя и оставался на своем месте, теперь видел мир по-другому, через рассказы пушинки. Эта необычная дружба напоминала, что каждое существо уникально и ценно, что сила духа не зависит от физической формы, и что настоящие друзья способны преодолеть любые барьеры. --- Такой текст служит интригующим началом для более глубокого и развёрнутого повествования о камешке и пушинке, подчёркивая важность дружбы, самопознания и взаимопонимания.

What began as a demand for an end to corruption within the Chinese Communist Party quickly escalated into a wide-ranging call for democratic reforms, freedom of the press, and civil liberties. This movement, however, was not merely a fleeting expression of discontent but a harbinger of profound change that would reshape the geopolitical landscape of East Asia. The protests, mirroring the revolutionary spirit of the Xinhai Revolution that had overthrown the Qing Dynasty nearly eight decades earlier, snowballed into an expansive uprising against the ruling Chinese Communist Party. As the echoes of dissent spread across the vast territories of China, the indomitable spirit of change ignited the suppressed aspirations of various ethnic regions, leading to a domino effect of declarations of independence from the central authority of Beijing. In the wake of the PRC's dissolution, a myriad of states emerged, each reclaiming their unique identity and governance systems, some of which harked back to eras before the Qing Dynasty. Tibet saw the restoration of its theocratic Buddhist monarchy under the Kingdom of Tibet, while in Central China, the historical legacy of the Tang Dynasty was revived in an Islamic sultanate that drew comparisons to the grandeur of past empires. Yunnan, embracing its distinct cultural heritage, reinstated the Bai-Han Dali Kingdom, and the vast expanses of East Turkestan saw the comeback of the Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate blend of the Kumul Khanate. The transformation was not confined to the peripheral regions. In the heartland of Han China, a monumental renaissance was underway. Influenced by the millenarian zeal of the Yellow Sand Society, a group that had long championed a return to the glory days of the Ming Dynasty, the phoenix of the Great Ming State rose from the ashes of the Communist Regime. This restored Empire of China, while officially retaining the nomenclature of the \\"People's Republic of China\\" for international diplomatic continuity, embraced the symbols and ethos of the Ming Dynasty, interwoven with elements reflecting the multi-ethnic legacy of the Beiyang Government's first Republic of China. The political landscape witnessed a dramatic reconfiguration with the remnants of the Chinese Communist Party rejoining the Young China Party, their ultra-nationalist left-wing ideology melding into the governance framework of the reconstituted Ming Empire. Meanwhile, across the straits in Taiwan, the remnants of the Kuomintang, bereft of their geopolitical leverage post-PRC, acquiesced to reunification under the restored Ming banner, cementing a poignant end to decades of division. The reconfiguration of power extended beyond the borders of China. Vietnam, a nation long shaped by the ebb and flow of Chinese influence, became the stage for another dramatic shift. Rogue elements from Nationalist China, seeking refuge and a new base of operations, masterminded the overthrow of the Communist regime in Vietnam, setting the stage for the re-establishment of the Republic of Vietnam. However, beneath the surface, a coalition of forces was at work to restore the Vietnamese monarchy under the Ngyuen dynasty, which, intriguingly, traced its lineage back to the Ming Dynasty, symbolizing a full-circle moment in the intertwined histories of China and Vietnam. The geopolitical reverberations of these transformations were colossal. Japan, seizing the moment, expanded its influence, reasserting control over Taiwan, the Pengu Islands, Sakhalin, the Kurils, and the Korean peninsula, simultaneously restoring its pre-war era protectorates of Manchukuo and Mengjiang, effectively reshaping the East Asian security and economic architecture. Amidst this tumultuous landscape, a new coalition, the East Asian Association, emerged, comprising the newly independent states and existing powers, all heralding a new era of cooperation and mutual respect, a beacon of stability in a world that had witnessed the eclipse of one of its most enduring empires. This period of rebirth and transformation marked not merely the fracturing of a monolithic state but the rekindling of diverse cultural legacies and governance models that had been suppressed under the banner of uniform communism. It was a testament to the enduring spirit of human resilience and the inexorable march towards self-determination and cultural rediscovery. This chapter in the annals of history, while fraught with conflict and upheaval, ultimately paved the way for a richer tapestry of nations, each contributing to a more nuanced and vibrant global mosaic."},{"prompt":"Write a *really* silly parody dialog script, set in the Alpha and Omega (2010) universe, about Kate and Humphrey coming across Stinky, Claudette, and Runt as adults, after they left their pack to start their own.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","completion":"**Origins of the Crimson Widow: The Redefined Saga of Natasha Romanoff** **Birth Year:** 1985, Leningrad, Soviet Union In an alternate universe, Natasha Romanoff was born not as an orphan destined for the Red Room, but as the cherished only child of two leading scientists in the Soviet Union, Mikhail and Elena Romanoff. Her parents were at the forefront of a covert operation named Project Perun, aiming to harness elemental powers and integrate them into the human body, with the goal of creating super soldiers to defend the motherland. **The Transformation:** 2001 At the age of 16, Natasha’s life took a drastic turn. A rival espionage agency infiltrated the secret facility where Project Perun was in progress. In the ensuing chaos, an experimental prototype — a device intended to imbue individuals with control over electric currents — was accidentally activated and merged with Natasha. While her parents were tragically killed during the attack, Natasha survived, but not as a mere mortal. The device had transformed her, gifting her with unparalleled control over electricity, enhanced strength, and reflexes beyond human limits. Realizing the potential threat she could pose, the Russian government confined her, intent on weaponizing her newfound abilities. Over several years, Natasha harnessed her powers, becoming a human weapon known as the Crimson Widow. **Escape to Freedom:** 2005 After years of servitude and secret missions under the guise of the Crimson Widow, Natasha grew disillusioned with her handlers' motives and the constant control over her life. In a daring escape that took her across continents, she defected, seeking asylum in the United States. **A New Beginning:** 2006-2010 In the U.S., Natasha's extraordinary abilities caught the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, who saw in her not a weapon, but a potential hero. After a period of scrutiny, she was recruited into S.H.I.E.L.D., where Natasha gradually transformed from a feared operative into a champion of justice. Using her alias, the Black Widow, she embarked on covert missions, fighting terrorism and threats of global magnitude. **Founding Avenger:** 2012 Natasha's prowess and unique abilities set her apart, making her a prime candidate for the Avengers Initiative. As one of the founding members, she played a crucial role in thwarting alien invasions, rogue AI uprisings, and inter-dimensional threats. Natasha's past as the Crimson Widow became a testament to her resilience and ability to change her destiny. **Sacrifice and Legacy:** 2025 In a climactic battle against a cosmic entity threatening Earth's existence, Natasha Romanoff, known to the world as the Black Widow, sacrificed herself to save millions. Her actions not only secured her place as a hero of Earth but also represented the possibility of redemption and transformation. **Beyond Death:** 2027 The legacy of Natasha Romanoff lived on through a foundation established in her honor, dedicated to helping those subjected to manipulation and control reclaim their lives and futures. The Black Widow became a symbol of hope, resilience, and the undying fight for freedom. This alternate origin story reimagines Natasha Romanoff not just as a spy but as a being of immense power and moral fortitude, whose journey from controlled weapon to global protector inspires generations."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

В силу текущих ограничений платформы, я не могу генерировать ответы неопределенно большой длины в одном сообщении."},{"prompt":"1000 слов","completion":"Прежде чем углубиться в тему тоски – этого многогранного, глубоко человеческого чувства, обладающего сложным палитрой эмоций и рефлексий, давайте начнем с определения. Тоска, казалось бы, недолговечное и неуловимое чувство, представляет собой состояние глубокой грусти, острого, болезненного ощущения неполноценности бытия, непостижимости мира и, порой, острой ностальгии по утраченным идеалам или несбывшимся мечтам. Она окутывает душу мглистым вуалем, сквозь который мир предстает в искаженном, иной раз трагическом свете. # 1. Философская грань тоски Философская трактовка тоски поднимает вопросы сущностных раздумий о человеческом существовании, его цели и закономерностях. Кьеркегор, метко называвший тоску \\"болезнью до смерти\\", подталкивает нас к размышлениям о неуловимости и непостижимости бесконечности человеческого духа. Тоска в этом ключе – глубинный маяк, освещающий наши внутренние бури и тьму, вызывая желание проникнуться вопросами бытия и его бесконечными горизонтами. # 2. Литературная и художественная грань В литературе и искусстве тоска украшена печальной красотой слов и красок. Великие произведения, такие как \\"Онегин\\" Пушкина или \\"Война и мир\\" Толстого, изобилуют персонажами, окутанными вуалью тоски по потерянному прошлому, иллюзорным мечтам, несбывшейся любви. В этих произведениях тоска выступает как средство погружения в глубины человеческой психики, раскрывая многослойность эмоций и переживаний. # 3. Социально-культурная грань Тоска может быть рассмотрена и как знак времени, отражение социокультурного контекста. В различные эпохи она могла означать разные вещи – от выражения интеллектуального протеста против буржуазного уклада жизни в эпоху романтизма до символа духовного одиночества и чувства чуждости в современном мире. В каждом обществе и культурном пространстве тоска приобретает свои уникальные оттенки, будучи отражением универсальных человеческих стремлений и разочарований. # 4. Психологическая грань С психологической точки зрения, тоска может рассматриваться как форма депрессии, сигнал тревоги от психики, указывающий на несоответствие между желаемым и действительным. Часто она связана с переживанием потери, как реальной, так и символической, и является признаком глубинного внутреннего конфликта. Однако, парадоксальным образом, именно через переживание тоски человек способен прийти к более глубокому самопознанию и осмыслению своих жизненных целей. # 5. Религиозная и духовная грань В религии и духовных учениях тоска может служить важным инструментом очищения души и приближения к Божественному. В христианском контексте она зачастую ассоциируется с понятием \\"страстной печали\\", которая, будучи принята и испытана, способствует духовному росту и приобретению мудрости. Тоска в данном аспекте выступает как чередование периодов духовных испытаний и прозрений, катарсиса и преображения. # Заключение Тоска, как видите, вечный спутник человечества, искус и мысли, насчитывает бесконечное множество оттенков, каждый из которых имеет свою глубину и многообразие. Это чувство, будучи сложным и многоаспектным, способно стать источником боли, и в то же время – катализатором для творчества, самопознания и даже духовного просветления. Умение проникновенно и целостно воспринимать тоску, постигать ее многочисленные грани и источники, как отражение нашей внутренней работы, так и отклик на внешний мир, предоставляет нам возможность более полного самоосознания и в итоге – гармонии."},{"prompt":"Write a hilarious explanation on why it would be impossible (and absurd) for Thomas the Tank Engine to take every fictional character ever created to the Moon so they can all play GameCube games together","completion":"The proposition of Thomas the Tank Engine, the steadfast locomotive protagonist of many children's narratives, embarking on an expedition to transport every fictional character ever created to the Moon for a mass GameCube gaming session is, on the surface, an idea that might make us all chuckle with delight or baffle at the absurdity. There are a plethora of reasons, rooted deeply in the comical and the ludicrous, as to why this undertaking would not just be impossible, but hilariously outlandish as well. First and foremost, we must consider the sheer logistical nightmare of such an endeavor. Thomas, being a train of admirable but decidedly Earth-bound design, lacks the necessary propulsion or life support systems to journey into outer space, not to mention land on the Moon. The image of Thomas chugging along through the vacuum of space, tracks magically laid in the cosmos, with his cheery face getting progressively more bewildered as he realizes he's left the cozy confines of Sodor far behind, is one that borders on the comically surreal. Even if we entertain the fantastical idea that Thomas has been fitted with the latest in space-travel technology, courtesy of some overly ambitious engineers from NASA with a penchant for children's literature, the next monumental challenge presents itself: corralling every fictional character ever created. From Elizabeth Bennet to Darth Vader, Sherlock Holmes to Pikachu, the sheer diversity and number of characters would pose an unfathomable task. Picture Thomas trying to organize an orderly queue of characters at Sodor's spaceport, attempting to check everyone's ticket (because let's be honest, he's a stickler for rules), while Godzilla is trying not to step on the Hobbits and Batman is in a heated debate with Hamlet about the ethics of vengeance. The mind boggles. Furthermore, even assuming that all these characters agree to participate and somehow manage to fit inside whatever space-bound contraption Thomas has become, there arises the question of GameCube logistics. Considering the power supply issues, the impracticality of setting up what would have to be the universe's largest TV screen, and the sheer number of controllers required, it’s hard not to laugh at the practicalities. And that's before we even get to deciding what game to play. Imagine the chaos of Link from \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" and Master Chief from \\"Halo\\" arguing over whether to play \\"Super Smash Bros. Melee\\" or \\"Mario Kart: Double Dash!!\\" Meanwhile, characters like Sherlock Holmes, who hail from a time before electricity, let alone video games, would be thoroughly bewildered, standing aside with a confused look on their esteemed faces. In essence, while the thought of Thomas the Tank Engine leading a motley crew of fictional characters on a lunar GameCube escapade is a delightful exercise in absurdity, the practicalities involved render it hilariously impossible. Such a scenario would test the very fabric of fictional and physical realities to their breaking points, leaving us all in stitches at the sheer, delightful ridiculousness of the idea. Remember, some tracks are better left untraveled, especially those leading directly into the vacuum of space with a cargo of eager gamers from across the fictional universe in tow."},{"prompt":"我在fl studio中导入了一个tom采样，我想通过钢琴窗使tomfill中的每个音有不同的音高(pitch)，但是最后他们却以相同的音高播放，我该怎么做","completion":"在FL Studio中，您可以使用Edison或Slicex将采样文件导入到钢琴卷中，并为每个音符设定不同的音高。以下是详细步骤： 1. 将您的tom采样文件导入到FL Studio中。 2. 在工程中选择Edison插件并将tom采样文件拖放到Edison窗口中。 3. 在Edison中，您可以将tom采样文件切割成单独的音符片段，然后拖放到钢琴卷中。 4. 在钢琴卷中，您可以通过拖动音符的位置改变它们的音高。您也可以在每个音符上使用Pitch按钮来精确调整音高。 5. 将这些音符排列成您想要的tom fill序列，并将其添加到您的歌曲中。 通过这种方式，您可以为每个tom fill中的音符设置不同的音高，从而实现您想要的效果。希望这能帮助到您！如果有任何疑问，请随时问我。"},{"prompt":"在钢琴窗中，拖动音符并没有改变他们的音高","completion":"抱歉，我之前给出的方法不够详细。让我们尝试另一种方法： 1. 将tom采样文件导入到FL Studio的播放列表中。 2. 在播放列表中找到您的tom采样文件，右键单击并选择“Open in new Fruity Slicer channel”。 3. 在Fruity Slicer插件中，您将看到tom采样文件被自动分割为不同的切片。 4. 单击“Mapping”选项卡，您将看到每个切片对应一个按键。 5. 您可以通过拖动这些按键来改变每个切片的音高。您也可以在每个按键上调整音高参数。 6. 将这些切片排列成您想要的tom fill序列，并将其添加到您的歌曲中。 通过使用Fruity Slicer插件，您可以更轻松地为每个切片设置不同的音高。希望这次能帮助到您！如有任何问题，请随时问我。"},{"prompt":"我希望可以通过在钢琴窗拖动实现音高变化","completion":"非常抱歉之前的回答并未解决您的问题。在FL Studio中，您可以尝试以下方法在钢琴卷中为每个音符设置不同的音高： 1. 将tom采样文件导入到FL Studio中并将其拖放到播放列表中。 2. 在FL Studio中创建一个新的采样器通道（Sampler Channel）。 3. 将该采样器通道添加到钢琴卷中。 4. 打开该采样器通道的编辑窗口，您将看到采样器控制界面。 5. 选中您想要调整音高的音符，并拖动该音符上方的“Pitch”控制杆来改变音高。您可以拖动控制杆向上或向下以调整音高。 6. 重复以上步骤为每个音符设置不同的音高。 7. 将这些音符排列成您想要的tom fill序列，并将其添加到您的歌曲中。 通过这种方法，您应该能够通过在钢琴卷中拖动音符来为每个音符设置不同的音高。希望这次能帮助到您！如有任何问题，请随时问我。"},{"prompt":"Create a completely different origin for Namor from Marvel Comics. Include key years, such as birth and death years.","completion":"**The Tale of Namor: The Ocean's Avenger** **Birth: 1901** In an alternate reality, Namor was not born to a human sea captain and an Atlantean princess. Instead, his origin is rooted in the mystical confluence of oceanic magic. During a rare celestial event in 1901, when the planets aligned and the sea levels surged higher than ever recorded, a solitary infant emerged from the ocean depths cradled in a giant clamshell. This infant, discovered by a humble fisherman on the shores of what would later be known as Atlantis, was unlike any other; he was marked with the sigil of the sea – a trident emblem glowing upon his brow, signifying his destiny as the Ocean's Avenger. **Early Years: 1901-1921** Raised among the Atlanteans, Namor grew under the tutelage of the realm's most learned scholars and fiercest warriors. Unlike the traditional tales of Atlantis being an isolationist kingdom, this version of Atlantis was a beacon of learning and diplomacy, striving to bridge the worlds of land and sea. Namor, with his unique heritage as a child of pure oceanic magic, became a symbol of hope and unity for both Atlanteans and the surface world. **Rise to Heroism: 1941** The true test of Namor's might came with the onset of World War II. Unlike his canon counterpart, who was often portrayed with a volatile temperament and shifting allegiances, this Namor was a steadfast protector of the innocent. His resolve was galvanized in 1941 when an Axis power, seeking to harness the mystical energies of Atlantis for their war effort, unleashed a devastating assault on the underwater kingdom. Namor, blending his mastery over the ocean with a compassionate leadership, rallied both Atlantean forces and surface world allies to repel the invaders. This victory solidified his reputation as a champion of peace and justice. **The Formation of a New Team: 1961** In the aftermath of the war and subsequent conflicts, Namor realized that threats to global security were becoming increasingly complex and required a united front. In 1961, he founded the Elemental Guardians, a coalition of heroes each representing a fundamental aspect of the natural world – Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit. As the embodiment of water, Namor led this team on various missions, thwarting plans to exploit or damage the natural world. This period was marked by adventures that highlighted environmental conservation and the interconnectedness of all living beings. **Legacy: 2001** Namor's death came not by the hand of a nemesis but through the passage of a century marked by battle, triumph, and ceaseless advocacy for the balance between man and nature. In 2001, during a ceremony commemorating his 100th year, Namor peacefully returned to the ocean's depths from whence he came, his body dissolving into a cascade of luminescent sea-life, signaling the rebirth of the ocean's magic. **Posthumous Influence** Namor's legacy persisted through the Elemental Guardians and the foundations of understanding he built between Atlantis and the surface world. His story became a legend; not just of a superhero, but as a reminder of our responsibilities to protect and respect the natural world. His sigil, once emblazoned upon his brow, became a universal symbol of unity and stewardship of the Earth, inspiring future generations to become custodians of the planet, much like Namor, the Ocean's Avenger, had been."},{"prompt":"Who are the members of the Elemental Guardians in this universe?","completion":"In this alternate universe where Namor, the Ocean's Avenger, leads the Elemental Guardians, the team is composed of heroes who embody the fundamental elements of the natural world. Each member not only represents their respective element but also brings unique abilities and insights that contribute to the team's mission to protect the Earth and its natural balance. Let's delve into the members of the Elemental Guardians: # 1. **Namor: The Water** - **Element:** Water - **Abilities:** Superhuman strength, aquatic abilities, control over sea life, and manipulation of water. - **Role:** As the leader, Namor is the heart of the team, driving their mission with his passion for protecting both the oceans and the surface world.

From battling pollution-spewing monsters to thwarting plans to exploit natural resources, the Elemental Guardians stand as a testament to the idea that unity and respect for the natural world are our greatest assets in safeguarding the planet. Their adventures forge deeper understandings of the delicate balance between humanity and nature, inspiring generations to come."},{"prompt":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun --ar 71:128","completion":"Imagine a breathtaking composition that radiates the dramatic intensity and elegance of Japanese samurai legends. Centered on a 71:128 aspect ratio, the artwork stretches horizontally, providing an expansive canvas to convey a narrative rich in tradition and aesthetic appeal. This piece, created with traditional Japanese ink (sumi-e), is a testament to the meticulous skill of the artist, capturing the essence of feudal Japan through nuanced brushwork. In the foreground, a samurai stands in a poised and dignified stance. The artist has masterfully utilized varying pressures of brushwork to outline the samurai's intricate armor, which is a depiction of careful craftsmanship, embodying both the physical and spiritual protection it offers. The helmet (kabuto), adorned with intricate details, suggests the samurai's rank and valor, while his face, partially obscured, hints at the stoicism and contemplative nature of these legendary warriors. The samurai's katana is drawn, its blade reflecting the last rays of the setting sun, which adds a layer of symbolism regarding the inevitability of life and death, and the honor in facing one’s destiny. The gradations of ink from deep black to soft grays illustrate the blade’s razor-sharp edge and the seamless skill with which it was forged. In the midground, delicate yet expressive brush strokes hint at a traditional Japanese landscape, blending with elements of nature that are iconic in such artworks. A gnarled cherry blossom tree in near silhouette bends gracefully against the weight of its history and beauty. Despite the fading light, a few petals are caught in a gentle breeze, symbolizing the fleeting nature of life, a theme often explored in the lore surrounding samurai. The background is dominated by the setting sun, depicted not with bold colors but suggested through a masterful gradation of ink from dark at the top to lighter shades, mimicking the fading light. This transition not only captures the literal sunset but also symbolizes the end of an era, the sun setting on the age of samurai. The mountains in the distance are executed with swift, confident strokes, indicating their permanence and stoic witness to the unfolding human drama. What enhances the atmospheric quality of this piece is the use of negative space, a hallmark of Japanese ink painting, allowing the viewer's imagination to fill in the details and engage more deeply with the scene. This technique ensures that the viewer's focus is drawn to the samurai and the poignant moment of contemplation and resolve against the backdrop of a fading day. In summary, this Japanese ink drawing is not just a visual representation but a narrative woven through intricate brushwork and deep symbolism. It invites the viewer into a moment suspended in time, between the ephemeral beauty of life and the enduring honor of the samurai's legacy."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Ответь на 700 слов. Распиши все грани тоски.","completion":"Тоска – это одно из самих сложных и многогранных человеческих чувств, переплетение душевной муки, усталости, неопределенности и тонкой нити надежды, которая всё ещё мерцает где-то в глубине. Чтобы полноценно охватить все грани этого состояния, стоит рассмотреть его под различными углами. **1. Эмоциональная грань тоски.** В эмоциональном плане тоска выступает как состояние глубокой печали и ностальгии. Это чувство утраты – потери чего-то важного, не всегда определенного, иногда даже невозможного. Тоска может приходить в виде внезапного порыва, напоминания о прошлом, о утраченных возможностях или о периодах жизни, казавшихся счастливее. В этом состоянии человек может ощущать себя уязвимым, одиноким, отстраненным от окружающего мира. **2. Физиологическая грань тоски.** Тоска не обходит стороной и тело человека. Она может сопровождаться усталостью, снижением энергетики, спазмами в животе, изменениями аппетита, бессонницей или, наоборот, повышенной сонливостью. Затяжная тоска нередко приводит к снижению иммунитета, проблемам с концентрацией внимания, даже к депрессии. **3. Когнитивная грань тоски.** На уровне мышления тоска вызывает зацикленность на негативе, невозможность сосредоточиться на текущих задачах, частую смену настроения. Мир воспринимается сквозь призму своего внутреннего состояния, всё вокруг кажется более серым и безрадостным. Человек, погруженный в тоску, склонен к переживанию, анализу прошлых событий, исканию причин своего состояния. Иногда это приводит к философским размышлениям о смысле жизни, человеческой судьбе и вечности. **4. Психологическая грань тоски.** Тоска тесно связана с ощущением собственной несостоятельности и бессилия перед лицом обстоятельств. Это состояние вызывает стремление к изменению, но в то же время – страх и неуверенность в будущем. В психологическом плане тоска может становиться триггером для саморазвития, поиска новых интересов и занятий, изменения образа жизни. Она может побудить к творчеству, воплощению идей, которые в другое время могли бы остаться лишь мечтами. **5. Социальная грань тоски.** Тоска влияет и на социальное взаимодействие. В этот период человек может отдаляться от друзей и близких, изолировать себя, отказываться от участия в социальной жизни. Или, наоборот, искать поддержки, сострадания, понимания среди окружения. Важным является умение выражать свои чувства и признавать их, делиться своими мыслями и переживаниями с другими, что помогает лучше понять самого себя и найти пути выхода из состояния тоски. **6. Духовная грань тоски.** Для некоторых тоска становится своеобразным духовным поиском, стремлением к разгадке глубинного смысла существования. Это состояние может побудить к изучению религиозных и философских учений, медитации, практикам самопознания. Через тоску человек способен прикоснуться к вечным вопросам бытия, по-новому взглянуть на отношения с миром и с собой, найти новые ответы и ощутить внутреннее обновление. **Заключение** Таким образом, тоска – это богатый и сложный мир внутренних переживаний, который заставляет нас на некоторое время остановиться и по-другому посмотреть на жизнь, прислушаться к себе, переоценить прошлое и по-новому взглянуть в будущее. Это чувство представляет собой не только испытание, но и возможность для личностного роста, самопознания и духовного развития."},{"prompt":"FY 2025 Platform Vision One Ideagen Begins Here MyGen A personalized Ideagen Experience • Apps • Support • Learning • Content • Productivity MyGen in 2024-2025 What are we achieving this fiscal year? • Single sign-on across products, support, content, learning • At least 4 integrated products • Release of content cloud marketplace • 10% of customers using more than 1 product • Growth & strategic products using common UI/UX • Business intelligence foundations • A published rolling 12-month roadmap for IHOME Single Identity & Sign-On • Best in class industry standard authentication provider • Open ID and SAML • Federation • A single Ideagen Identity • User synchronization Product Integrations Ideagen Risk Management & Ideagen Internal Audit • Authentication • Licensing • Alerts, Notifications, Reminders • Training EHSQ Cloud • Authentication • Alerts, Notifications, Reminders • Training Product Integrations Ideagen WorkRite Ideagen PleaseReview Ideagen Op Central Easy App Access • Apps you have • Apps your org has • Apps that are useful to you Productivity in one place • Quick actions available in your products • Required actions, tasks, and notifications visible and accessible Learning • Provide customers with an integrated support, content, and learning experience • Access material relevant to their products quickly • Lay the foundation for certifications and learning gamification Support • Access to knowledge base • Open and follow up on support tickets Content Cloud Marketplace Slide Subtitle • Provide access to content relevant to a customer’s needs and work to a purchasable library 10% customers using more than 1 product ~6% 10% ~20% Current State FY24 FY25 Target Future State (FY26+) This includes active interaction with learning and content Growth & Strategic Products Common UI/UX Helix • TBD Business Intelligence Foundations Insights • TBD Published 12 month roadmap Always up to date and available in Aha!

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","completion":"**Title:** The Mystic Quartet **Origin Story Overview:** In the year 2024, amidst a world increasingly blending technology with ancient mysticism, four daring explorers uncover a hidden temple in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. Unknown to the world, this temple, dating back to the early 1500s, houses the convergence point of Earth's mystic ley lines, a knot of unfathomable arcane energy. The explorers, while initially seeking historical artifacts, find themselves thrust into an ancient ritual that alters their very essence, giving them powers beyond the scope of human comprehension. Thus, they become the Mystic Quartet. **Members and Origins:** 1. **Dr. Rachel Storm \\"The Elemental\\" (1990 - )** - **Origin:** A renowned environmental scientist, Rachel led the expedition to uncover the impact of climate change on hidden ecosystems. During the ritual, she gains the power to manipulate the elements of nature—fire, water, air, and earth. With her profound connection to the planet, she vows to protect it from both mystical and human threats. 2. **Mark Richards \\"The Phantom\\" (1988 - )** - **Origin:** A former special forces operator turned thrill-seeking explorer, Mark's past is as shadowy as his new abilities. He gains the power of invisibility and intangibility, allowing him to pass through solid objects and become unseen to the naked eye. Using his strategic mind and combat skills, he becomes the untraceable protector of the innocent. 3. **Susan \\"Sue\\" Grimm \\"The Guardian\\" (1992 - )** - **Origin:** Originally a medical doctor who dedicated her life to helping indigenous tribes and remote populations, Sue joined the expedition to find new plants for medicinal research.

He is granted the power to teleport across vast distances and dimensions, becoming a living nexus point. His flair for dramatics and boundless curiosity often lead the team into uncharted territories. **Team Formation and Philosophy:** The ritual in the temple not only bestows them with powers but also binds their fates together, compelling them to become protectors of the natural and supernatural worlds. They adopt the name \\"The Mystic Quartet\\" and dedicate their lives to exploring the unknown realms, safeguarding the balance between the mystical and the material, and combating threats that seek to disrupt the harmony of existence. **Key Events:** - **2024:** The team discovers the hidden temple and undergoes the transformation. - **2025:** The Mystic Quartet thwarts a dimensional incursion by elder demons seeking to invade Earth. - **2026:** They establish the \\"Nexus Foundation,\\" a front for their operations, aimed at researching, preserving, and integrating ancient magic and wisdom with modern society to create a harmonious future. - **2028:** The team faces a moral dilemma when confronted with a technomancer villain whose vision of eradicating human suffering by controlling free will challenges their beliefs in the sanctity of independence and the complexity of human nature. **Legacy:** The Mystic Quartet not only represents a new dawn of heroes melding the mystical with the superhuman but also embodies the belief that understanding and synergy between different realms can lead to a more profound guardianship of all existence. Through their adventures, they inspire a new generation to explore, respect, and protect both the seen and unseen aspects of the world."},{"prompt":"i want yo build agents using langchain, but not using open ai api","completion":"If you're looking to build agents using LangChain without relying on the OpenAI API, you have several alternative options for setting up your language models. LangChain, developed by Llama, is designed to facilitate the creation of LLM (Large Language Model)-powered applications, and it's adaptable to use with various language models besides those provided by OpenAI. Here's a general approach to build agents with LangChain without using the OpenAI API: # 1. Choose an Alternative Language Model First, you need to select an alternative language model. Some popular choices include: - **Hugging Face Transformers**: Offers a plethora of pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, and EleutherAI’s models amongst others. These models are open-source and can be used freely or with their API. - **EleutherAI Models**: Known for GPT-Neo and GPT-J, these are powerful open-source alternatives to GPT-3. They can be downloaded and run locally or on cloud servers. - **BLOOM by BigScience**: Another robust and open-source model that’s considered a good alternative for multilingual applications. # 2. Install LangChain and Dependencies Ensure you have LangChain and other necessary libraries installed. Depending on the language model you choose, you might need specific packages (like Hugging Face's \`transformers\`) installed in your environment. # 3. Configure LangChain to Use the Selected Model LangChain is designed to be model agnostic, so you’ll need to configure it to interface with your chosen language model. This typically involves specifying the model’s API endpoints if using a hosted model, or details on how to run the model locally if you’re not using an API. For local models, ensure you have the necessary computational resources; large models require significant GPU memory. # 4. Implement Your Agent With LangChain and your language model setup, you can start implementing your agent. LangChain provides a variety of tools for integrating language models into applications, from simple chatbots to complex decision-making agents. Use LangChain's abstraction layers to build your application logic without worrying about the underlying model mechanics. # Tips for Building: - **Resource Management**: Running large language models can be resource-intensive. Consider efficiency and resource requirements when choosing your setup. - **Documentation and Community**: Make use of the documentation provided by LangChain, Hugging Face, or other model creators. Community forums and GitHub issues are also great resources for solving specific problems. - **Compliance and Ethics**: When switching from OpenAI to other models, keep in mind the ethical considerations and potential biases in these models. Always strive for responsible AI use. By following these steps, you should be able to leverage the versatility of LangChain to build agents powered by alternative language models to OpenAI's offerings. Remember that the landscape of LLMs and tools like LangChain is rapidly evolving, so staying updated with the latest developments can unlock even more possibilities."},{"prompt":"can I use llma 2 with langchain?","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, direct references to \\"Llama 2\\" specifically in the context of LangChain or integration capabilities with LangChain were not explicitly detailed in publicly available sources or documentation. However, considering the nature and purpose of both technologies, it's important to understand how LangChain operates to assess the possibility of integrating any large language model, including variations or successors to LLaMA (if that's what \\"Llama 2\\" refers to). LangChain, developed to enable the creation and deployment of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), is designed with modularity and flexibility in mind. This means it's built to be compatible with a wide range of LLMs, assuming those models can be interfaced with through APIs or are accessible for local deployment. # Steps for Using a New LLM with LangChain: If you're looking to use an LLM (potentially referred to as \\"Llama 2\\" in your case) with LangChain, here are general steps that can be taken, based on the capabilities and architecture of LangChain as well as the accessibility of the LLM: 1. **Confirm the Model’s Accessibility**: Ensure that the model you intend to use (e.g., \\"Llama 2\\") is accessible either through an API or available for download and local deployment. For downloadable models, you'll also need to ensure you have the infrastructure to support it, particularly for large models that require significant computational resources. 2. **Understand the Model’s API or Interface**: If the model can be accessed via API, familiarize yourself with the API documentation to understand how to make requests to the model. For locally running models, ensure you understand how to load and interface with the model within your environment. 3. **Integrate with LangChain**: LangChain provides abstractions for interacting with LLMs, but you may need to write some custom integration code to connect LangChain with your specific LLM if direct support isn’t already provided. This might involve: - Writing custom adapters or wrappers that allow LangChain to communicate with your LLM using the expected inputs and outputs. - Configuring LangChain settings to point to your model’s API endpoints or to use the model locally within your application’s environment. 4. **Test and Iterate**: Once you've set up the initial integration, thoroughly test the functionality to ensure that your LLM is correctly processing inputs and returning expected outputs within the context of your LangChain-powered application. 5. **Stay Updated on Developments**: Both LangChain and the landscape of LLMs evolve rapidly. Keep an eye on updates from LangChain, which might add direct support for new models, and from the developers or community around the LLM you're using. Given the rapid pace of development in AI and machine learning, direct support for newer models like a hypothetical \\"Llama 2\\" can emerge over time, either from the LangChain developers themselves or from the community through plugins or contributions. It’s also worth engaging with the respective communities (e.g., GitHub, forums, Discord) for the latest information and potential third-party integrations."},{"prompt":"How does coq10 affect heart rate","completion":"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a naturally occurring substance that plays a critical role in the generation of energy within cells, particularly in the mitochondria. It is found in every cell of the body but is particularly concentrated in organs that require a lot of energy, such as the heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas. The effect of CoQ10 on heart rate can be indirect and is more related to its impact on overall heart health and function rather than directly altering the heart rate in a typical scenario. Here are some ways CoQ10 can influence heart health, which could indirectly affect heart rate: 1. **Energy Production:** By enhancing energy production in heart muscle cells, CoQ10 supports the heart's ability to pump blood more efficiently. An efficient heart may not need to work as hard to maintain adequate circulation, which can indirectly impact heart rate, especially under stress or during physical activity. 2. **Antioxidant Properties:** CoQ10 serves as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by harmful molecules known as free radicals. This is particularly important in the heart, where oxidative stress can contribute to heart disease and heart failure. By defending against oxidative damage, CoQ10 may help maintain healthy heart muscle tissue and function. 3. **Improvement of Heart Failure Symptoms:** Some research suggests that CoQ10 supplements can improve symptoms and reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in people with heart failure. Heart failure often leads to an increased heart rate because the heart tries to compensate for its decreased ability to pump blood effectively. By potentially improving heart function, CoQ10 supplementation might indirectly help normalize heart rate in heart failure patients. 4. **Blood Pressure:** There is evidence to suggest that CoQ10 may have a modest effect on lowering blood pressure in people with hypertension. High blood pressure can strain the heart and affect its rate. Thus, by helping to reduce blood pressure, CoQ10 might also have an indirect effect on heart rate stabilization in individuals with hypertension. It's important to note that while CoQ10 supplementation can have benefits for heart health, it is not a cure-all and should be considered a complementary approach rather than a primary treatment for heart conditions. Anyone considering CoQ10 supplements for heart health or any other purpose should consult with a healthcare provider to ensure it's appropriate for their situation, especially if they are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions. Additionally, the impact of CoQ10 on heart rate and health can vary from person to person based on individual health status and the presence of specific cardiac conditions."},{"prompt":"In an otherwise healthy 65 year old male who has a slow heart rate, how might it affect them?","completion":"If we're considering an otherwise healthy 65-year-old male with a naturally slow heart rate, a condition known as bradycardia, adding CoQ10 supplementation into the equation needs careful consideration. Bradycardia is typically defined as a heart rate that's too slow—usually under 60 beats per minute. While it can be a sign of efficient heart function in well-trained athletes, in others it may cause insufficient blood flow to meet the body's demands. # Direct Impact of CoQ10 on Bradycardia There isn’t direct evidence that CoQ10 significantly affects the heart rate to either increase or decrease it markedly in people with bradycardia, particularly if they are not suffering from heart disease or other conditions. CoQ10 primarily supports heart health by improving energy production in cells, offering antioxidant protection, and potentially improving heart muscle function. # Potential Considerations 1. **Energy Production**: CoQ10 could help improve the overall energy utilization of the heart, which might make it more efficient in cases where there's not an intrinsic problem with the heart's electrical conduction system. For an individual with bradycardia, this might mean more effective pumping action rather than an increase in heart rate. 2. **No Direct Effect on Rate**: Since CoQ10 doesn't directly increase the heart rate, it's unlikely to cause significant changes in an otherwise healthy person. It's more about supporting heart function and overall cardiovascular health. 3. **Consulting Healthcare Providers**: For anyone, especially those over 60 considering CoQ10 supplementation, it's crucial to consult healthcare providers. This is even more important for individuals with bradycardia or other heart conditions, as the interplay between supplements, existing conditions, and medications needs expert evaluation. 4. **Monitoring**: If a decision is made to proceed with CoQ10 supplementation, monitoring its effects on heart function, energy levels, and overall wellbeing is wise. Any adverse effects or significant changes should prompt a reassessment of the supplementation. # Conclusion In an otherwise healthy 65-year-old male with bradycardia, CoQ10 supplementation might offer benefits in terms of heart muscle efficiency and energy production without directly affecting the heart rate. However, its use should be personalized, weighing potential benefits against any risks, and ideally, it should be undertaken under medical advice. The impact of CoQ10, like any supplement or medication, can vary widely among individuals, and what works for one person may not work for another."},{"prompt":"anatomy of the skull bones and and important clinical relations and significances, and all foramens and locations with the contents of each one ,","completion":"The human skull is a complex structure made up of several bones that are categorized into two main parts: the neurocranium and the viscerocranium. The neurocranium, also known as the cranial vault, encases and protects the brain, whereas the viscerocranium, or facial skeleton, comprises the bones supporting the face. Understanding the anatomy of skull bones, including the foramina (singular: foramen) and their contents, is crucial in clinical practice for diagnosing various neurovascular conditions, performing surgical interventions, and understanding the pathophysiology of certain diseases. # Neurocranium Bones: 1. **Frontal Bone:** Forms the forehead and the upper parts of the orbits. Clinically, frontal sinusitis can lead to frontal headaches. 2. **Parietal Bones (2):** Located on the sides of the cranium. They are involved in protecting the brain and its vasculature. 3. **Temporal Bones (2):** Contain the middle and inner ear structures. Temporal bone fractures can affect hearing and balance. 4. **Occipital Bone:** Contains the foramen magnum, where the brain connects to the spinal cord. Fractures or lesions here can be fatal. 5. **Sphenoid Bone:** A complex bone located at the base of the skull. The sella turcica, part of the sphenoid, houses the pituitary gland. 6. **Ethmoid Bone:** A spongy bone that forms part of the nasal cavity and the orbits. Ethmoid sinusitis can lead to ethmoid headaches. # Viscerocranium (Facial Skeleton) Bones: 1. **Mandible:** The lower jaw, crucial for mastication. Dislocation or fractures can affect eating and speech. 2. **Maxillae (2):** Form the upper jaw, part of the orbits and nasal cavity. Maxillary sinusitis is a common condition affecting the sinuses. 3. **Zygomatic Bones (2):** Cheekbones, which also contribute to the orbit. Fractures can affect vision and facial structure. 4. **Nasal Bones (2):** Form the bridge of the nose. Fractures are a common injury. 5. **Lacrimal Bones (2):** Small bones forming part of the orbital wall. They are associated with tear drainage. 6. **Palatine Bones (2):** Form part of the hard palate and nasal cavity. Abnormalities can affect speech and swallowing. 7. **Vomer:** The bone forming part of the nasal septum. Deviations can lead to breathing difficulties. 8. **Inferior Nasal Conchae (2):** These contribute to the nasal cavity. They play a role in conditioning inhaled air. # Notable Foramina and Their Contents: 1. **Foramen Magnum (Occipital Bone):** Contains the spinal cord, vertebral arteries, and meningeal layers. It's crucial as it connects the brain with the spinal cord. 2. **Optic Canal (Sphenoid Bone):** Transmits the optic nerve (CN II) and ophthalmic artery. Lesions here can lead to vision loss. 3. **Superior Orbital Fissure (Sphenoid Bone):** Contains cranial nerves III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), V1 (ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal), and VI (abducens) and the superior ophthalmic vein. Affects eye movements and sensations. 4. **Foramen Rotundum (Sphenoid Bone):** Transmits the maxillary nerve (CN V2). Affects facial sensation. 5. **Foramen Ovale (Sphenoid Bone):** Contains the mandibular nerve (CN V3). Affects mastication and facial sensation. 6. **Foramen Spinosum (Sphenoid Bone):** Contains the middle meningeal artery, which is important in epidural hematomas. 7. **Jugular Foramen (Between the Temporal and Occipital Bones):** Contains the jugular vein, glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), vagus nerve (CN X), and accessory nerve (CN XI). Involves swallowing, taste, and movements of the head. 8. **Internal Acoustic Meatus (Temporal Bone):** For the facial nerve (CN VII) and the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), affecting hearing and balance. This overview outlines the fundamental anatomy of the skull bones, notable foramina, and their clinical significance. Knowledge of these structures is vital for diagnosing and managing numerous conditions affecting the head and neck."},{"prompt":"basal skull bones","completion":"The base of the skull, also known as the cranial base or skull base, comprises several bones that form the floor of the cranial cavity, providing support for the brain and offering passageways for arteries, veins, and nerves. The skull base is complex and can be divided into three main regions: the anterior cranial fossa, the middle cranial fossa, and the posterior cranial fossa. Each of these areas supports different parts of the brain and contains specific foramina for the passage of neurovascular structures. # Anterior Cranial Fossa The anterior cranial fossa is the most forward of the three. It supports the frontal lobes of the brain and consists of parts of three bones: 1. **Frontal Bone**: Primarily the orbital part that forms the roof of the eye sockets. 2. **Ethmoid Bone**: Contributes to the floor of the anterior fossa, particularly through the cribriform plate, which is perforated by olfactory nerve filaments. 3. **Sphenoid Bone**: Specifically, the lesser wing of the sphenoid, which forms a part of the boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae. # Middle Cranial Fossa The middle cranial fossa is deeper and situated posteriorly to the anterior fossa, housing the temporal lobes of the brain. This fossa comprises parts of the sphenoid bone and the temporal bone: 1. **Sphenoid Bone**: - The body of the sphenoid, including the sella turcica, which houses the pituitary gland. - The greater wings of the sphenoid, which partially form the floor of the middle cranial fossa and contribute to the lateral wall of the skull. 2. **Temporal Bone**: - The squamous part and the petrous part contribute to the middle cranial fossa. The petrous part is particularly significant as it contains the internal acoustic meatus, which allows the facial nerve (CN VII) and the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) to pass. # Posterior Cranial Fossa The posterior cranial fossa is the deepest and largest of the three, accommodating the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. It consists of the following bones: 1. **Occipital Bone**: Including the basilar part and the foramen magnum, the largest foramen, through which the spinal cord, vertebral arteries, and meningeal structures pass. 2. **Temporal Bone**: Specifically, the mastoid part, which borders the posterior fossa and contains the mastoid air cells. 3. **Sphenoid Bone**: The body continues posteriorly to contribute to the clivus, which slopes backward to meet the basilar part of the occipital bone. # Clinical Significance Understanding the anatomy and relationships of the basal skull bones is crucial in several clinical contexts: - **Neurosurgery and orthopedics**: For interventions targeting brain tumors, vascular anomalies, or traumatic injuries. - **Otorhinolaryngology**: In treating conditions related to the ear, nose, and throat, such as sinus surgery or addressing skull base tumors. - **Neurology and neurovascular conditions**: Diagnosing conditions like basilar invagination, Chiari malformations, or cranial nerve impairments. The intricate arrangement and the number of critical structures passing through the foramina of the skull base underscore its importance in both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of medical practice."},{"prompt":"which is severer the rhinorrhea or otorrhea and why ?explain specifically","completion":"The severity between rhinorrhea (discharge from the nose) and otorrhea (discharge from the ear) often depends on the underlying cause rather than the condition itself. Both symptoms can range from mild and self-limiting to indicators of severe underlying health issues. However, when considering potential complications and the underlying causes, otorrhea can be associated with conditions that might be seen as more severe due to their direct impact on hearing and the risk of intracranial complications. Here's a comparison based on underlying causes, potential complications, and why otorrhea might be considered more severe in specific contexts: # Rhinorrhea Rhinorrhea implies a runny nose, which is a common symptom of conditions like colds, allergies, sinus infections, and even changes in weather. Most of these conditions are benign and self-limiting: - **Allergic Rhinitis:** Often caused by an allergic response to pollen, dust, or other allergens. Typically not severe but can affect quality of life. - **Common Colds and Infections:** Viral infections are a common cause of rhinorrhea. While uncomfortable, they usually resolve without severe complications. - **Non-allergic Rhinitis:** Triggered by factors like weather changes, spicy food, or medications. Again, not typically severe. # Otorrhea Otorrhea, or ear discharge, can be associated with more specific and sometimes severe conditions: - **External Otitis (Swimmer's Ear):** An infection of the outer ear canal, which can be quite painful but is usually manageable with treatment. - **Chronic Otitis Media:** Long-term infections of the middle ear can lead to persistent discharge. Chronic infections can deteriorate hearing over time and potentially lead to more severe complications such as mastoiditis (infection of the mastoid bone) or cholesteatoma (an abnormal skin growth in the middle ear). - **Skull Trauma:** Otorrhea can indicate a basilar skull fracture, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks through the ear. This condition could be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. # Why Otorrhea Can Be Considered More Severe: - **Direct Impact on Hearing:** Ear infections and conditions leading to otorrhea can directly affect hearing, sometimes permanently. - **Potential for Serious Complications:** While complications can arise from severe nasal discharge (e.g., sinus infections leading to meningitis), otorrhea due to middle ear infections or skull fractures can lead to immediate and severe complications, including brain infections (e.g., abscesses, meningitis) or persistent CSF leaks. - **Indicator of Trauma or Intracranial Issues:** Otorrhea, especially if it involves CSF (clear fluid), can indicate severe trauma or skull base fractures. CSF otorrhea requires urgent evaluation and intervention to prevent life-threatening infections like meningitis. In conclusion, while both rhinorrhea and otorrhea can range from benign to severe, the potential for direct hearing impact, the nature of the underlying causes of otorrhea, and the severe complications associated with them often make otorrhea a more concerning symptom. It's essential to consider the context, accompanying symptoms, and the individual's health history when assessing severity. Immediate professional evaluation is recommended for any persistent, unusual, or severe cases of otorrhea or rhinorrhea."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],B={key:0},G={key:1};function N(o,e,h,m,n,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",j,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),a("div",z,[(t(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(t(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
