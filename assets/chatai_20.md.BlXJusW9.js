Since profits are distributed according to the capital subscribed, we can set up the following proportion for A's share: A's share of profit / Total profit = A's share of capital / Total capital (805 / 2415) = ((1/3)X / X) Solving for X in the above equation is unnecessary because X will cancel out. Let's simplify the left side of the equation: 805 / 2415 = 1/3 To find the fraction that C subscribes, we need to find Y.

Let (B) be the midpoint of ( overparen{AC} ) which we colored blue. 4. **Consider Polarity**: Now, consider the diametrically opposite points ( A', B', C' ) to (A, B, C), respectively: - If ( A' ) is a red point, then (AA') is a diameter, satisfying the problem condition. - Similarly, if ( C' ) is a red point, then (CC') is a diameter. - If both (A') and (C') are blue points, ( B' ) must be a red point (since three consecutive blue points are not possible). 5. **Contradiction Approach**: Suppose there does not exist a pair of diametric red points. Now consider the minor arc ( overparen{AB'} ) subtending ( angle ACB' ) with length 2018. 6. **Arc Analysis**: For ( overparen{AB'} ), we determine the number of segments of each category: Let ( n_{1} ) be the number of segments of length 1, ( n_{2} ) be the number of segments of length 2, ( n_{3} ) be the number of segments of length 3: [ 2018 = n_{1} + 2n_{2} + 3n_{3} ] Similarly, for arc ( overparen{CB'} ): [ 2018 = n_{1}' + 2n_{2}' + 3n_{3}' ] 7. **Opposite Arc Consideration**: Each arc of length 1 on ( overparen{AB'} ) has endpoints opposed to the arcs of adjacent points opposite on ( overparen{CB'}): Resulting in: [ n_{1} = n_{3}', quad n_{1}' = n_{3} ] 8. **Deriving an Equation**: The total number of arcs of length 1 is 673: [ n_{1} + n_{1}'= 673 Rightarrow n_{1} + n_{3} = 673 ] Plugging into our equations: [ 2018 = n_{1} + 2n_{2} + 3(673 - n_{1}) ] Simplifying we find: [ 2018 = n_{1} + 2n_{2} + 2019 - 3n_{1} ] [ 2n_{2} = 2n_{1} - 1 ] Which gives an inherent contradiction since (2n_{2}) must be even.

Prove that there exists a *way* such that if the person move according to it, then he can arrive to the room E of any building.","completion":"To prove that there exists a \\"way\\" ( P ) such that if a person moves according to it, then he can arrive at the room ( E ) from room ( S ) in any building, we need to consider the properties of the building and the movement rules. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - The building is a connected graph where rooms are nodes and doors are edges. - Room ( S ) has exactly one door, making it a leaf node in the graph. - Room ( E ) is another node in the graph. - The sequence ( P ) consists of infinite ( L ) and ( R ) instructions. 2. **Graph Theory Insight:** - Since the building is connected, there is a path from ( S ) to ( E ). - The challenge is to find a sequence ( P ) that guarantees reaching ( E ) regardless of the building's structure. 3. **Binary Representation Approach:** - Consider the binary representation of the move number ( n ). - If the sum of the digits of ( n ) in binary is even, move right (( R )); if odd, move left (( L )). 4. **Constructing the Sequence ( P ):** - Let ( P_n ) be determined by the sum of the digits of ( n ) in binary. - For example, ( P_1 = R ) (since ( 1 ) in binary is ( 1 ), sum is odd), ( P_2 = L ) (since ( 2 ) in binary is ( 10 ), sum is even), and so on. 5. **Proving the Sequence Works:** - We need to show that this sequence will eventually lead to ( E ). - Since ( S ) has only one door, the first move is deterministic. - For subsequent moves, the sequence ( P ) ensures that all possible paths are explored due to the nature of binary representation. 6. **Exploration of All Paths:** - The binary sequence ensures that every possible combination of left and right turns is covered. - This exhaustive exploration guarantees that the path to ( E ) will be found. 7. **Conclusion:** - The sequence ( P ) based on the sum of binary digits ensures that the person will eventually reach ( E ).

To solve the problem, let's break down the steps: 1. **Reinterpret the problem in combinatorial terms:** - We are asked to find the number of ways to partition a 1 times 12 board using red, blue, and green tiles. - Suppose we use a total tiles, with b blue, and c green tiles. - Then, the equation is a + b + c = 12 with the condition a geq 6. 2. **Expression for the number of ways:** - The number of ways to arrange a total tiles where b are blue, c are green, and (a - b - c) are red is given by the multinomial coefficient: binom{a}{b, c, a - b - c} = frac{a!}{b!c!(a - b - c)!}. 3. **Setting up the recursion:** - Let a_n be the number of ways to tile a 1 times n board with red, blue, and green 1 times 2 tiles. - We can derive the following recursion: - If the first piece is a red 1 times 1 tile, it leaves a 1 times (n-1) board. - If the first piece is a blue or green 1 times 2 tile, it leaves a 1 times (n-2) board. - This gives us the recursive relation: a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}. 4. **Find the base cases:** - For n=1: We have only one way to place a single red 1 times 1 tile, so a_1 = 1. - For n=2: The board can be covered with two red 1 times 1 tiles, one blue 1 times 2 tile, or one green 1 times 2 tile, hence a_2 = 3. 5. **Solving the characteristic equation:** - The characteristic equation for the recursion a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2} is: t^2 - t - 2 = 0. - Solving for t, the roots are t = 2 and t = -1. 6. **General solution for a_n:** - The general form of the solution is: a_n = A cdot (-1)^n + B cdot 2^n, - Using the initial conditions a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 3, we solve for A and B: - For n = 1: 1 = A(-1)^1 + B cdot 2^1 = -A + 2B, - For n = 2: 3 = A(-1)^2 + B cdot 2^2 = A + 4B. 7. **Solve the system of equations:** - We have the system: [ begin{cases} -A + 2B = 1, A + 4B = 3. end{cases} ] - Adding the two equations, we get: 3A + 6B = 3 implies A + 2B = 1. - Using A + 4B = 3: A + 4B = 3 implies (1 - 2B) + 4B = 3 implies 1 + 2B = 3 implies 2B = 2 implies B = 1. - Substituting B into A + 2B = 1: A + 2 cdot 1 = 1 implies A + 2 = 1 implies A = -1. 8. **Express a_n using A and B:** - Thus: a_n = -frac{1}{3}(-1)^n + frac{2}{3} 2^n = frac{2^{n+1} + (-1)^n}{3}. 9. **Evaluate for n = 12:** - Substitute n = 12: a_{12} = frac{2^{12+1} + (-1)^{12}}{3} = frac{2^{13} + 1}{3} = frac{8192 + 1}{3} = frac{8193}{3} = 2731. # Conclusion: Hence, the final answer is: boxed{2731}."},{"prompt":"the arithmetic sequence left{ {{a}_{n}} right}, it is known that ({{a}_{2}}+{{a}_{6}}+{{a}_{10}}=15) and ({{a}_{4}}+{{a}_{5}}+{{a}_{6}}+...+{{a}_{12}}=99).

The perpendiculars from points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) to the sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) are the same as the perpendiculars to the same sides at points ( A_2, B_2, C_2 ).

It is easy to verify that: [ 0 leqslant v < beta. ] Furthermore, if there exist other integers u' and real numbers v' such that: [ alpha = beta u' + v', quad text{with} quad 0 leqslant v' < beta, ] then by comparing both expressions for alpha, we have: [ beta (u - u') = v' - v. ] The left-hand side of this equation is an integer multiple of beta, hence the absolute value of its magnitude is either 0 or at least beta: [ |beta (u - u')| geqslant beta, ] whereas the right-hand side |v' - v| is strictly less than beta, which implies: [ |v' - v| < beta. ] This forces u = u' and v = v'. Thus, the uniqueness of u and v is proven. 2. **Returning to the Original Problem** By the above lemma, for any k = 1, 2, ldots, n, we can write: [ k = a_k x + b_k quad text{and} quad k = c_k (x + 1) + d_k, ] where: [ a_k = leftlfloor frac{k}{x} rightrfloor, quad 0 leqslant b_k < x, quad c_k = leftlfloor frac{k}{x+1} rightrfloor, quad 0 leqslant d_k < x+1. ] 3. **Expression Setup** Let: [ S = sum_{k=1}^{n}left(a_k x - c_k (x+1)right). ] Then each term can be simplified as follows: [ a_k x - c_k (x+1) = (k - b_k) - (k - d_k) = d_k - b_k. ] Hence, the sum S becomes: [ S = sum_{k=1}^{n}(d_k - b_k). ] 4. **Partition and Index Set Definition** Let: [ I = { 1 leqslant k leqslant n mid d_k > 1 }. ] Define a function f as: [ f(k) = k - c_k - 1. ] When k in I, we have: [ k = c_k (x+1) + d_k > c_k + 1. ] Hence, [ 0 < f(k) < n, ] implying f maps the set I to the set {1, 2, ldots, n}.

From 2c = 2, we find c = 1. 2. Using e = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2}, we substitute c = 1 to get frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{2}, which gives us a = 2. 3.

So, we have three unknowns (the hours worked by each person) and two equations: 1. x + (x + 20) + y = 90 (where y represents the hours worked by the third person) 2. The ratio of the hours worked by the three people is x : (x + 20) : y We can simplify the first equation to find y: 2x + 20 + y = 90 2x + y = 70 y = 70 - 2x Now we have the hours worked by the third person in terms of x. We need to find a value of x that makes sense in the context of the problem. Since the total hours are 90, and the hardest working person worked 20 hours more than the least, x must be less than 35 (because if x were 35, the hardest working person would have worked 55 hours, and that would leave no hours for the third person).

Let q be the probability that a seed does not germinate, so q = 1 - p = 0.1. Since 1000 seeds are sown and each seed that fails to germinate requires the planting of 2 additional seeds, we can model X as a sum of individual random variables, where each random variable corresponds to the additional seeds needed for each original seed sown. The outcome of each seed can be thought of as a Bernoulli trial, with a \\"success\\" meaning the seed fails to germinate (since that would contribute to X). Therefore, X follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 1000 and q = 0.1. To find the mean (expected value) E[X], use the formula E[X] = n cdot q cdot t, where t is the number of additional seeds needed per seed that fails to germinate. In this case, t = 2, so we have: E[X] = n cdot q cdot t = 1000 cdot 0.1 cdot 2 = 200.

For this problem, the line must pass through at least three distinct points. 3. **Direction Vectors**: The direction of a line can be described by a vector (a, b, c), where a, b, c are integers that describe how we move from one point to another along the line. For the points to be within bounds and the line to pass through exactly three points, a, b, c must be chosen such that the line does not extend beyond this range when moving from one point to another. 4. **Finding Valid Vectors**: Since the line should pass through exactly three distinct points, the maximum step size for each component of the vector should be such that the third point (i+2a, j+2b, k+2c) is still within the grid. We restrict a, b, c to values in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. 5. **Counting Distinct Lines**: Each vector (a, b, c) where a, b, c in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} and not all zero, gives a potential direction for lines.

However, if 11 guests show up, the (frac{1}{10})-sized pieces would need to be further divided to ensure each of the 11 guests gets an equal portion of the pie. 4.

By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( a^{p_i-1} equiv 1 pmod{p_i} ), ( b^{p_i-1} equiv 1 pmod{p_i} ), and ( c^{p_i-1} equiv 1 pmod{p_i} ). Thus, ( S(K_M) equiv 1 + 1 - 1 equiv 1 pmod{p_i} ). As ( M rightarrow +infty ), ( S(K_M) ) will have a prime factor not in ( E ), contradicting the finiteness of ( E ). - **Case 2**: ( exists i ), ( p_i ) divides ( c ) but not ( a ) nor ( b ). The same argument as in Case 1 applies because ( S(K_M) equiv a^{K_M} + b^{K_M} - c^{K_M} equiv 1 + 1 - 0 equiv 2 pmod{p_i} ), and as ( M rightarrow +infty ), ( S(K_M) ) will have a prime factor not in ( E ). - **Case 3**: ( exists i ), ( p_i ) divides ( a ) and ( b ) but not ( c ). Then ( S(K_M) equiv 0 + 0 - c^{K_M} equiv -c^{K_M} pmod{p_i} ). Since ( c notin {a, b} ), ( c ) is not divisible by ( p_i ), and thus ( S(K_M) ) will have a prime factor not in ( E ). - **Case 4**: ( p_i ) divides ( a ) or ( b ) (but not both) and ( p_i ) does not divide ( c ). Without loss of generality, assume ( p_i ) divides ( a ). There exists a smallest positive integer ( T ) such that ( p_i mid S(T) ). Let ( U ) be the maximal integer such that ( p_i^U mid S(T) ). Then ( p_i^U mid b^T - c^T ). If ( p_i mid S(X) ), then ( p_i mid b^{X-T} - c^{X-T} ). By induction, ( T ) divides ( X ). Thus, ( b^{zT} - c^{zT} = (b^T - c^T)((b^T)^{z-1} + dots + (c^T)^{z-1}) ). Since ( b^T equiv c^T pmod{p_i} ), the second factor is ( z(c^T)^{z-1} pmod{p_i} ). Hence, ( n = p_i T ) is the smallest positive integer such that ( p_i^{U+1} mid S(n) ). By induction, ( n = p_i^r T ) is the smallest positive integer such that ( p_i^{U+r} mid S(n) ).

We can refer to Cases 1, 2, 3, or 4 by factoring out such ( p_i )'s in ( S(n) ). By considering all cases, we see that our assumption that ( E ) is finite leads to a contradiction.

D: xy12 is a quadratic binomial.","completion":"To evaluate each statement, let's analyze them one by one: **A**: For the monomial ab, the coefficient is implicitly 1 because any term without a visible coefficient has a coefficient of 1. The degree of a monomial is the sum of the exponents of all its variables. Here, a and b each have an exponent of 1, so the degree is 1+1=2. Thus, the statement that the coefficient is 0 is incorrect. The correct statement should be: The coefficient of the monomial ab is 1, and its degree is 2. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it states the coefficient is 0. **B**: For the monomial -2^{3}a^{2}b^{3}, the coefficient is -2^{3} = -8, not -2. The degree is the sum of the exponents of a and b, which is 2+3=5. The statement incorrectly identifies the coefficient as -2 and the degree as 6. The correct statement should be: The coefficient of the monomial -2^{3}a^{2}b^{3} is -8, and its degree is 5.

The correct statement should be: The terms of the polynomial -4a^{2}b+3ab-5 are -4a^{2}b, 3ab, and -5. Therefore, option C is incorrect. **D**: The expression xy-12 is indeed a quadratic binomial. A quadratic binomial is a polynomial of degree 2 with two terms. Here, xy has a degree of 2 (1 from x and 1 from y), and -12 is a constant term.

This ( a ) represents the count of occurrences of a number from ( L_i ). - This number that appears ( a ) times in ( L_i ) will lead to the number ( a ) appearing at least ( a ) times in ( L_{i+1} ). 4. **Monotonic Properties and Reductions**: - Observing a single column through every line, every entry after the first is non-decreasing because the frequency representation does not reduce. - More formally, if ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{2018} ) are the numbers in ( L_1 ), then the numbers in ( L_2 ) start to show how many times each number from ( L_1 ) appears, and this frequency count representation tends to organize. 5. **Stabilization Towards a Fixed Point**: - Each line created has a sum of elements equal to 2018. - The transformation from one line to the next does not indefinitely increase since each transformation reflects frequency counts which are bounded by the initial 2018 elements. - Because this sequence is bounded and monotonic (in the sense of stabilization), it must eventually become constant. 6. **Summing It Up**: - If the process did not stabilize to identical lines, it would imply that we continue to get an increasing sequence of sums, which contradicts the invariant sum of 2018. - Therefore, the only possible eventuality is that after sufficient repetitions, we achieve a line that mirrors itself upon transformation. # Conclusion: Hence, after sufficient applications of the described transformation, all lines will become identical.

Step 1: Choose the two elements for the intersection We start by choosing 2 elements out of the 5 elements in S to be in the intersection of the two subsets. The number of ways to choose 2 elements from 5 is given by the combination formula binom{n}{k}, where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose.

Each of these elements can either go to the first subset, the second subset, or both. However, since we need the union of the two subsets to be S, each element must be in at least one subset. This gives us 2^3 = 8 ways to distribute the remaining 3 elements across the two subsets. Step 3: Correct for over-counting Since the order of choosing the subsets does not matter, any pair of subsets (A, B) is considered the same as (B, A). Thus, we have over-counted by a factor of 2.

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation: 1. **Identification of the Shape**: We are given a polygon, but the details suggest that this polygon exhibits properties of containing rectangles with right-angled corners. 2. **Key Property of Rectangles**: The property used here is that if you draw a line through the intersection of the diagonals of a rectangle, this line will divide the rectangle into two parts of equal area, owing to central symmetry. 3. **Application on Provided Shape**: - Consider the given shape as comprising two distinct rectangles. 4. **First Rectangle Analysis**: - Draw the diagonals of the first rectangle. - Identify the point of intersection of these diagonals. - This point is the center of symmetry of the rectangle. 5. **Second Rectangle Analysis**: - Repeat the same steps for the second rectangle. 6. **Drawing the Dividing Line**: - Now, draw a straight line that passes through both centers of symmetry identified in steps 4 and 5. - This line is guaranteed to divide the entire figure into two regions of equal area because it leverages the central symmetry of the two rectangles involved. 7. **Verification**: - It is critical to ensure that the dividing line intersects all boundaries correctly and connects the centers of symmetry as required for any ratios of side lengths. 8. **Diagrams for Better Understanding**: - Refer to the diagrams provided in your materials which show the intersecting points of diagonals and the final dividing line passing through these points, ensuring equal partition. Using these steps, the figure can be reliably divided into two polygons of equal area.

We are required to find the value of (a + b + c + d) and the smallest number among (a, b, c, d). Part (a): 1. To find (a + b + c + d), we sum all six given sums: [ (a + b) + (b + c) + (c + d) + (d + a) + (a + c) + (b + d). ] 2. Since three sums are 23 and three are 34, we have: [ 3 times 23 + 3 times 34. ] 3. Simplify the expression: [ 3 times 23 + 3 times 34 = 69 + 102 = 171. ] 4. On the other hand, the sum of all six given sums can also be written as: [ 3(a + b + c + d). ] This is because each variable (a, b, c, d) appears three times. 5. Equate the two expressions and solve for (a + b + c + d): [ 3(a + b + c + d) = 171, ] [ a + b + c + d = frac{171}{3} = 57. ] Thus, (a + b + c + d = 57).

This implies (a + b), (a + c), and (b + c) are all distinct sums which contradicts the condition that there are exactly three sums equal to 23 and three sums equal to 34. 3.

Consider the three possible cases where there are exactly two distinct values: - Case 1: (a = b = c < d). - Case 2: (a = b < c = d). - Case 3: (a < b = c = d). 5. For Case 1 ((a = b = c < d)): [ a + b = b + c = a + c = 2a quad text{and} quad a + d, b + d, c + d = a + d. ] The system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 2a = 23 a + d = 34 end{array} right. ] This equation is not solvable in natural numbers as (a) would need to be a non-integer. 6.

Thus, a=sqrt{3} and b=1. Hence, the equation of ellipse C is frac{x^{2}}{3}+y^{2}=1. (II) Proof: If the slope of line AB exists, let the equation of line AB be y=kx+m. Substitute this into the equation of the ellipse, and eliminate the variable to get (1+3k^{2})x^{2}+6kmx+3m^{2}-3=0. Hence, x_{1}+x_{2}=-frac{6km}{1+3k^{2}} and x_{1}x_{2}=frac{3m^{2}-3}{1+3k^{2}}. Since the circle D with AB as its diameter passes through the origin, overrightarrow{OA}cdotoverrightarrow{OB}=0. This implies x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=0. Substitute the expressions for x_{1}+x_{2} and x_{1}x_{2} into this equation to get 4m^{2}=3(k^{2}+1). Thus, the distance from origin O to line AB is d=frac{|m|}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}}=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. If the slope of line AB does not exist, by the symmetry of the ellipse, x_{1}=x_{2} and y_{1}=-y_{2}.

Assume the center of the star is denoted by (S). 2. **Figure Out the Internal Angle at Each Vertex**: - When we draw lines connecting each vertex of the heptagram to the center (S), we effectively form several isosceles triangles (e.g., (triangle ASC, triangle BSD, ldots, triangle GSB)). 3. **Calculate the Central Angles**: - Each of these isosceles triangles shares a vertex at (S) with an angle (gamma) formed by the central segments to each adjacent pair of vertices. - The central angles sum to (360^circ). Given 7 points, each sector angle at the center (S) can be calculated geometrically: [ gamma = 2 times frac{360^circ}{7} ] 4. **Angle (alpha) within the Triangle**: - The angle we need, (alpha), is part of isosceles triangle (triangle ASC). If we look at (triangle ASC), the vertices (alpha) are the angles at (A) and (C). - Given that each vertex angle in these isosceles triangles must sum with the angle (gamma) to (180^circ), we can state: [ 2alpha + gamma = 180^circ ] - Substitute (gamma) from the unit circle information: [ 2alpha + 2 cdot frac{360^circ}{7} = 180^circ ] - Simplifying the angle relationship: [ 2alpha + frac{720^circ}{7} = 180^circ ] [ 2alpha + frac{720^circ}{7} = 180^circ ] [ 2alpha = 180^circ - frac{720^circ}{7} ] - Further simplifying: [ 2alpha = 180^circ - frac{4 times 180^circ}{7} ] [ 2alpha = 180^circ left(1 - frac{4}{7}right) ] - Solving for (alpha): [ 2alpha = 180^circ left(frac{3}{7}right) ] [ alpha = 90^circ left(frac{3}{7}right) ] [ alpha = frac{270^circ}{7} ] - Convert to degrees: [ alpha approx 38^circ 34' 17'' ] Therefore, the measure of the angle (alpha) in the regular seven-pointed star is: [ boxed{38^circ 34' 17''} ]"},{"prompt":"The ratio of the number of games won to the number of games lost by the High School Harriers is 7/3.

To solve this, let's analyze the constraints: - Each pair of vertices (a, b) where a + b = 101 implies these are connected in G. 5. There are only 50 such pairs, because a ranges from 1 to 50 and b would be 100, 99, ldots, 51 respectively. 6.

Now, if we choose 51 vertices, then: - There are less than 50 pairs that sum to 101, meaning there are at least n - 50 vertices that do not have another vertex that sums to 101 in the subset of chosen vertices. 8. If we have these vertices, the number of vertices \`not in pairs\` is given by n - 50. 9.

To prove that infinitely many elements of this sequence can be written in the form (a_m = x cdot a_p + y cdot a_q), where (x) and (y) are suitable positive integers and (p neq q), let's proceed with the following steps: 1. **Diophantine Equation Approach**: Recall that if (d) is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (a_p) and (a_q), then Bézout's identity states that there exist integers (x') and (y') such that: [ d = x' cdot a_p + y' cdot a_q ] Since (a_p) and (a_q) are positive integers, we can ensure that (d neq 0). Without loss of generality, let us consider (d = 1) because we can always consider ( frac{a_p}{d} ) and ( frac{a_q}{d} ). 2. **Finding (a_m)**: Suppose (a_p) and (a_q) are two distinct elements of the sequence such that: [ gcd(a_p, a_q) = 1 ] We need to find infinitely many (a_m) that can be expressed as: [ a_m = x cdot a_p + y cdot a_q ] for some positive integers (x) and (y). 3. **Constructing Sequence Elements**: Start constructing elements of the sequence by choosing pairs (a_p) and (a_q) such that (p neq q) and (gcd(a_p, a_q) = 1). Note that since the sequence is strictly increasing, for any fixed (p), there are infinitely many (q > p) such that (a_q) can be chosen. 4. **Infinite Solutions**: Given that for any relatively prime (a_p) and (a_q): [ a_p leq a_m leq a_q ] with (x) and (y) as positive integers, increasing values of (x) and (y) generate increasingly larger (a_m) values that remain within the bounds of the sequence. Thus, since there are infinitely many choices of (p) and (q) where (gcd(a_p, a_q) = 1), and for each pair, infinitely many positive values of (x) and (y) satisfying (a_m = x cdot a_p + y cdot a_q), we conclude that: # Conclusion: [ boxed{ text{there are infinitely many } a_m text{ of the form } x cdot a_p + y cdot a_q text{ for suitable } x text{ and } y, text{ where } p neq q.} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of 2^{2005} times 5^{2007} times 3?","completion":"To find the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of 2^{2005} times 5^{2007} times 3, we can simplify the expression step by step: First, we recognize that 2 times 5 = 10, which is a base of our decimal system. This simplification helps us to directly find the decimal representation of the product. We proceed as follows: [ 2^{2005} times 5^{2007} times 3 = (2 times 5)^{2005} times 5^2 times 3 ] Since 2 times 5 = 10, we substitute this into the equation: [ = 10^{2005} times 5^2 times 3 ] We know that 5^2 = 25 and multiplying it by 3 gives 75.

The key to solving this problem lies in two aspects: using basic inequalities and the relationship with extremal values to find the values of the parameters, and using the method of differences and the properties of midpoints to find the slope of the line containing the chord.

There are two exhaustive scenarios to consider: a. The set includes a specific element (say the n^{th} element). b. The set does not include the n^{th} element. 3. **Choosing k elements when the n^{th} element is included**: If the set of k elements includes the n^{th} element, we then need to select the remaining k - 1 elements from the first n - 1 elements. The number of ways to do this is given by binom{n-1}{k-1}. 4. **Choosing k elements when the n^{th} element is excluded**: If the set of k elements does not include the n^{th} element, we then need to select all k elements from the first n - 1 elements.

Consider ( f(1) ). Let ( f(1) ) have the prime factorization ( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ), where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are distinct prime numbers and ( e_1, e_2, ldots, e_k ) are their respective positive integer exponents. 3. **Behavior with Powers of 2**: Consider the values ( f(2^e) ) where ( e ) is a positive integer.

Assume ( n ) has the prime factorization: [ n = p_{1}^{a_{1}} p_{2}^{a_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{a_{k}} ] where ( k geq 1 ), and ( p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{k} ) are distinct primes, and ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} ) are positive integers. 3.

First, we find out how many crayons Francine has in the boxes. Since she has a total of 85 crayons and 5 of them are loose, the crayons in the boxes amount to: [85 - 5 = 80] So, Francine has 80 crayons in the boxes. 2.

Now, we calculate the total number of loose crayons that need to be placed in boxes. Francine and her friend together have: [5 + 27 = 32] So, there are 32 loose crayons in total. 4. Finally, to find out how many more boxes they need for the loose crayons, we divide the total number of loose crayons by the number of crayons each box can hold: [32 div 16 = 2] Therefore, they need 2 more boxes for the loose crayons.

We need to determine if it is possible, after several moves, to make all glasses stand upright. In one move, we can flip any four glasses. Step 1: Establishing Initial Condition Initially, all 7 glasses are upside down. Let's denote upside down by ( U ) and upright by ( R ). So, initially, we have: [ UUUUUUU ] Step 2: Observing Parity Change Each move involves flipping 4 glasses. Let’s analyze how the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of upside-down glasses changes when we flip any 4 glasses. Consider a group of 4 glasses. Let ( k ) be the number of upside-down glasses among these 4 glasses. Since glasses can only be in two states (upside-down or upright), we have: [ k in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ] After flipping these 4 glasses: - The ( k ) upside-down glasses will become upright. - The ( 4-k ) upright glasses will become upside-down. Thus, for these 4 glasses: - Number of upside-down glasses after flipping: [ 4 - k ] We need to find the change in the number of upside-down glasses: [ Delta text{(upside-down glasses)} = (4 - k) - k = 4 - 2k ] Step 3: Understanding the Effect on Parity Since ( 4 - 2k ) is always an even number (as the difference of an even number and even multiple of ( k )), the number of upside-down glasses can only change by an even number. Thus: [ Delta n_u = 4 - 2k = 0, 2, -2, 4, -4, -6 ] Where ( n_u ) is the number of upside-down glasses. Step 4: Initial Parity and Desired Parity Initially, there are 7 upside-down glasses (( n_u = 7 )), which is an odd number. To achieve all glasses upright, we need 0 upside-down glasses (( n_u = 0 )), which is an even number. Consequently: - Parity of initial state = odd - Parity of final state = even However, from step 3, we observed flipping 4 glasses does not change the parity of the number of upside-down glasses (it always changes by an even number). Step 5: Implication Since the parity of the number of upside-down glasses does not change (remains odd), it is impossible to achieve an even number of upside-down glasses (0, specifically). # Conclusion Since the number of upside-down glasses cannot change parity and remains odd throughout, we cannot convert all upside-down glasses to upright.

Notice that (wh) is even if at least one of (w) or (h) is even. Therefore, the pairs with at least one even dimension are counted. For (w) from 1 to 49: - If (w) is even, (h = 50 - w) can be anything (even or odd), and it makes the area even. - If (w) is odd, (h = 50 - w) must be odd to make the area even. Counting the solutions: - Half of the numbers from 1 to 50 are even (there are 25 even numbers in this range). - Half of the numbers from 1 to 50 are odd (likewise 25), but odd (w) leads to odd (h) making the product odd, not even.

The number of students taking French is 41, and the number of students taking German is 22. However, 9 of these students are taking both courses. So, if we simply added 41 and 22, we would be counting those 9 students twice.

To satisfy this condition, the least value allowed by neg p, which is -3, must be less than or equal to 'a'. Simultaneously, the greatest value allowed by neg p, which is 1, must be the ceiling for 'a'. However, since neg p is not a necessary condition, 'a' can be exactly 1 but it cannot be less than 1.

This is because the behavior of an even function on the positive side of its domain is the mirror image of its behavior on the negative side. 2. Given alpha and beta are interior angles of an acute triangle, their sum must be greater than 90^{circ}. This can be expressed as alpha + beta > 90^{circ}. 3.

For linear functions, the sign of the slope determines the direction of change in y as x increases. Since the slope is negative, y decreases as x increases, irrespective of the value of x. Therefore, this function satisfies the given condition for all x, including when x < -1. 2. **Function ②: y = frac{1}{x}** This function represents an inverse proportion. For x < 0, as x increases (moves towards zero), the value of y becomes more negative, indicating that y decreases as x increases. This behavior aligns with the condition for x < -1, as the function is defined and exhibits the described behavior in this domain. 3. **Function ③: y = -x^2 + 1** This is a downward-opening quadratic function. For x < 0, as x increases (moves towards zero), the value of -x^2 becomes less negative, causing y to increase. This behavior contradicts the given condition, as y increases with an increase in x for x < -1. **Conclusion:** Functions ① and ② satisfy the condition \\"when x < -1, the value of the function y decreases as x increases\\", while function ③ does not. Therefore, out of the three functions, two functions meet the criteria. **Probability Calculation:** The probability that a randomly selected function from the three given functions satisfies the condition is the ratio of the number of functions that satisfy the condition to the total number of functions.

We denote this monthly decline rate as x%, which means that each month, the earnings are multiplied by (1-x), where x is expressed as a decimal. Given that the earnings were 200 million US dollars in July and dropped to 98 million US dollars by September, we can model the situation with the following equation, considering the earnings decline over two months: 1. Start with the initial earnings in July: 200 million US dollars. 2. Apply the decline rate for August: 200(1-x). 3. Apply the decline rate again for September: 200(1-x)(1-x) = 200(1-x)^2. 4. Set the September earnings equal to the given value: 200(1-x)^2 = 98. Therefore, the equation that represents the situation is: 200(1-x)^2 = 98 Encapsulating the final answer: boxed{200(1-x)^2 = 98}"},{"prompt":"a sequence of Fibonacci numbers, 8 consecutive numbers are chosen.

The problem is asking us to prove that the sum of these 8 consecutive Fibonacci numbers is not a Fibonacci number. 2. **State the relevant equation from the referenced problem (problem (underline{3.113})):** From the problem, we are given the following equality: [ F_{n} + F_{n+1} + F_{n+2} + ldots + F_{n+7} = F_{n+9} - F_{n+2} ] 3. **Explain the inequality involving Fibonacci numbers:** We need to show that the sum F_{n} + F_{n+1} + F_{n+2} + ldots + F_{n+7} is not a Fibonacci number. To do this, consider the given equality: [ F_{n+9} - F_{n+2} ] 4. **Verify the inequality and boundary conditions:** We analyze the inequality: [ F_{n+8} < F_{n+9} - F_{n+2} < F_{n+9} ] - (F_{n+8}) is the 8th next Fibonacci number from (F_n). - (F_{n+9} - F_{n+2}) should be within the range of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers to determine it's not a Fibonacci number. 5. **Break down and explain the conditions and constraints:** For a number (A) to be a Fibonacci number, it must be exactly equal to some (F_{k}) for some (k). However, we see: [ F_{n+8} < F_{n+9} - F_{n+2} < F_{n+9} ] Given that (F_{n+8}) and (F_{n+9}) are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, no other Fibonacci number lies strictly between them by the definition of the Fibonacci sequence (each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones and grows larger monotonically). 6. **Conclude with the derived fact:** Since (F_{n+9} - F_{n+2}) is not a Fibonacci number (it strictly falls between two consecutive Fibonacci numbers), the sum of the 8 consecutive Fibonacci numbers (F_{n} + F_{n+1} + ldots + F_{n+7}) also cannot be a Fibonacci number, because those sums exactly satisfy the conditions of the equation and fall within non-Fibonacci bounds.

Let's denote the numbers as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2018} ) arranged in a circle. 2. **Distinct Remainders Property:** Consider the sum of any 8 consecutive numbers ( a_i, a_{i+1}, ldots, a_{i+7} ). Since each sum needs to give a distinct remainder when divided by 2018, we will reason about the overall sum of these numbers. 3. **Counting the Cyclic Sums:** Since the numbers are arranged in a circle, there are exactly 2018 such sums of 8 consecutive numbers. 4. **Overall Sum Representation:** Let ( S ) be the sum of all numbers from 1 to 2018: [ S = 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 2018 = frac{2018 cdot 2019}{2} = 2018 cdot 1009. ] 5. **Summing All Group Sums:** The total sum of all these 2018 groups of 8 consecutive numbers actually counts each number exactly 8 times. Therefore, the total sum of all sums of these 8 numbers is: [ 8S = 8 cdot (1 + 2 + cdots + 2018) = 8 cdot 2018 cdot 1009. ] 6. **Partition the Total Sum:** On the other side, let’s consider the remainders when these sums are divided by 2018. Since there are 2018 such sums and each should give a distinct remainder between 0 and 2017, their sum is equivalent to the sum of the first 2018 numbers taken modulo 2018: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + 2017 = frac{2017 cdot 2018}{2} ] Reducing modulo 2018 gives the sum of the first 2018 numbers: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + 2017 = frac{2017 cdot 2018}{2} equiv 0 pmod{2018}. ] 7. **Contradiction:** Now consider the discrepancy: from our rearrangement assumption, we have: [ 8 cdot 2018 cdot 1009 equiv k pmod{2018}, ] where ( k ) is the sum of remainders from ( 0 ) to ( 2017 mod 2018 ). We get: [ 8 cdot 2018 cdot 1009 equiv k equiv 0 pmod{2018} ] Here, the right-hand side is an even number (as every term ( 8 times text{an integer} )). But the earlier arrangement argument states ( sum_{i=0}^{2017} i equiv 1009 pmod{2} ), an odd number. 8. **Conclusion:** As there is a contradiction where the sum of all sums should be odd (since each sum modulo different remainders should be odd), we conclude that our initial assumption is false. Thus, it is not possible to arrange the numbers 1 through 2018 in such a manner.

Adding these inequalities gives us: [frac{15}{8}a + frac{10}{7}c < b + d = 500.] 3. Multiplying through by 8 and 7 to clear the denominators, we get: [15a + 16c < 5600.] 4. Let M = a + c, which represents the total points Beta scored over the two days. We want to maximize M. Subtracting 16M from both sides of the inequality gives us: [5a < 5600 - 16M.] 5.

The ( n )-th roots of unity are ( zeta^0, zeta^1, ldots, zeta^{n-1} ). 3. **Polynomials ( R_k ):** Define the polynomials ( R_k(x_1, ldots, x_n) = sum_{j=1}^n x_j^k ). These polynomials will be used to construct ( P ). 4. **Lemma 0:** For all positive integers ( k < n ), it holds that ( zeta_1^k + zeta_2^k + cdots + zeta_n^k = 0 ). 5. **Lemma 1:** If ( a_1, ldots, a_n in mathcal{S} ), then ( R_k(a_1, ldots, a_n) = 0 ) for all ( k ) in ( D ) (the set of positive proper divisors of ( n )) if and only if ( a_1, ldots, a_n ) are pairwise distinct. **Proof of Lemma 1:** - If ( a_1, ldots, a_n ) are pairwise distinct, then ( R_k(a_1, ldots, a_n) = 0 ) for all ( k < n ) by Lemma 0. - Conversely, write ( a_j = zeta^{e_j} ) for ( 0 leq e_j < n ). Let ( R(x) = x^{e_1} + x^{e_2} + cdots + x^{e_n} ). Since ( R(zeta^k) = R_k(a_1, ldots, a_n) = 0 ) for all ( k in D ), ( R ) is divisible by every cyclotomic polynomial ( Phi_{n/k} ) for ( k in D ). Thus, ( R ) is divisible by their product: [ prod_{k in D} Phi_{n/k} = frac{x^n - 1}{x - 1} = 1 + x + cdots + x^{n-1}. ] - Since ( deg R leq n - 1 ) and ( R(1) = n ), it follows that ( R(x) = 1 + x + cdots + x^{n-1} ), implying ( a_1, ldots, a_n ) are pairwise distinct. 6. **Constructing ( P ):** Consider the polynomial: [ P(t, x_1, ldots, x_n) = sum_{k in D} t^k R_k(x_1, ldots, x_n). ] For ( a_1, ldots, a_n in mathcal{S} ), ( P(t, a_1, ldots, a_n) ) is a polynomial in ( t ). By Lemma 1, this polynomial vanishes identically if and only if ( a_1, ldots, a_n ) are pairwise distinct. 7. **Degree of ( P ):** The degree of ( P ) is determined by the largest proper divisor ( d ) of ( n ). Alternatively, it is ( frac{n}{p} ), where ( p ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). 8. **Verification:** - **First Approach (Allen Liu):** Suppose ( deg P < d ). Consider the polynomial: [ Q(y_1, ldots, y_p) = sum_{j=1}^p P(zeta_j y_j, zeta_{p+j} y_j, ldots, zeta_{p(d-1)+j} y_j). ] If ( b_1, ldots, b_p in mathcal{T} ) (the set of ( d )-th roots of unity), then ( Q(b_1, ldots, b_p) = 0 ). By Lemma 2, ( Q ) vanishes identically, leading to a contradiction. - **Second Approach (Authors):** Let ( mathcal{P} ) be the set of polynomials of the form ( sum_{k=1}^{n-1} Q_k R_k ) with ( deg P < n ). Using Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, we show that ( mathcal{P} = mathcal{Q} ), the set of polynomials vanishing on all permutations of ( zeta_1, ldots, zeta_n ). This leads to a contradiction if ( deg P < d ).

(If (P_{n}=0), then the sequence simply terminates.) Let (N) be the number of starting positions (P_{0}) on the (x)axis such that (P_{0}=P_{2008}).

The line ell_n with slope 1 passing through P_n intersects the hyperbola mathcal{C}, and P_{n+1} is defined as the orthogonal projection of the intersection point onto the x-axis. 2. **Intersection analysis**: The line ell_n has the form y = x - x_n. Substituting this into the hyperbola's equation, we get: [ (x - x_n)^2 - x^2 = 1 ] Solving for x gives the point of intersection. Let this intersection point on mathcal{C} be (x_{n+1}, x_{n+1} - x_n). Since it lies on the hyperbola, we have: [ (x_{n+1} - x_n)^2 - x_{n+1}^2 = 1 ] Rearranging this equation for x_{n+1}: [ x_{n+1} = frac{x_n^2 - 1}{2 x_n} ] 3. **Recursive sequence relation**: To gain insight into x_n, note that if we choose theta_0 in (0, pi) such that cot theta_0 = x_0, then define theta_n = 2^n theta_0. Using the double-angle formula for cotangent, we have: [ cot (2 theta_n) = frac{cot^2 theta_n - 1}{2 cot theta_n} ] This shows: [ x_{n+1} = cot(2 theta_n) ] By induction, we deduce that x_n = cot(theta_n) = cot(2^n theta_0). 4. **Periodic sequence condition**: Given P_0 = P_{2008}, this means x_0 = x_{2008}. Thus: [ cot theta_0 = cot (2^{2008} theta_0) ] Hence: [ 2^{2008} theta_0 = kpi + theta_0 quad text{for some integer } k ] Which simplifies to: [ theta_0 = frac{kpi}{2^{2008} - 1} ] We need theta_0 in (0, pi), so k must be any integer between 1 and 2^{2008} - 2 (inclusive). 5. **Count possible starting positions N**: There are 2^{2008} - 2 such values of k. Now we need the remainder of this number when divided by 2008. 6. **Computing the remainder using number theory**: The modulus 2008 = 2^3 times 251.

If ( f(x) ) were always positive or always negative, because (sin x > 0) for all ( x in (0, pi)), the integrals would not equal zero: [ int_0^pi f(x) sin x , dx neq 0 ] This contradicts the given condition that the integral is zero. 4. **Assume one sign change**: Suppose ( f(x) ) changes sign exactly once at ( x = k ). Let us consider ( g(x) = sin(x - k) ). The function ( sin(x - k) ) changes sign exactly once at ( x = k ). 5. **Analyze the integral**: Now consider the integral: [ int_0^pi f(x) sin(x - k) , dx ] Using trigonometric identities and by breaking down the integral: [ int_0^pi f(x) sin(x - k) , dx = cos k int_0^pi f(x) sin x , dx - sin k int_0^pi f(x) cos x , dx ] 6. **Substituting zero integral conditions**: Given: (int_0^pi f(x) sin x , dx = 0) and (int_0^pi f(x) cos x , dx = 0) Therefore: [ int_0^pi f(x) sin(x - k) , dx = cos k cdot 0 - sin k cdot 0 = 0 ] 7. **Contradiction**: Since ( sin(x - k) ) and ( f(x) ) change sign exactly once in the interval ((0, pi)), the integral (int_0^pi f(x) sin(x - k) , dx ) cannot be zero. This contradicts our assumptions. 8. **Conclusion on sign changes**: Therefore, ( f(x) ) must change sign at least two times in the interval ((0, pi)). Since ( f(x) ) changes sign, it must be zero at least twice in ((0, pi)).

Represent the boundary of the region by ( f(theta) ) for ( 0 leq theta leq pi ) and (-g(theta)) for ( 0 leq -theta leq -pi ). 2. **Moments about the x-axis**: Integrating moments about the x-axis: [ int_0^pi f(theta) sin theta , dtheta = int_0^pi g(theta) sin theta , dtheta ] Let ( h(theta) = g(pi - theta) ), equivalent to: [ int_0^pi h(theta) sin theta , dtheta = int_0^pi g(pi - theta) sin theta , dtheta ] Thus: [ int_0^pi (f(theta) - h(theta)) sin theta , dtheta = 0 ] 3. **Moments about the y-axis**: Similarly, integrating moments about the y-axis: [ int_0^pi f(theta) cos theta , dtheta + int_0^pi g(theta) cos theta , dtheta = 0 ] Since ( h(theta) = g(pi - theta) ), we get: [ int_0^pi (f(theta) - h(theta)) cos theta , dtheta = 0 ] 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the first part's result, ( (f(theta) - h(theta)) = 0 ) needs at least two zeros in ((0, pi)), meaning ( f(theta) = g(pi - theta) ).

We can then determine the sign of the expression in each interval divided by the critical points: - When a < -1 , both factors are negative, so the expression is positive. - When -1 < a < 3 , one factor is negative and the other is positive, which makes the expression negative. - When a > 3 , both factors are positive, so the expression is positive.

Extend ( BD ) through ( D ) and drop a perpendicular from ( C ) to this extended line, let the foot of the perpendicular be ( E ). Since ( BD ) is a median and ( angle ABD = 90^circ ), ( angle CED = 90^circ ) as well. 5. Since ( angle ABD = angle CED = 90^circ ) and ( angle BDA = angle EDC ) (vertical angles), ( triangle ABD cong triangle CED ) by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. 6. From the congruence ( triangle ABD cong triangle CED ), it follows that ( AB = CE ). Given ( AB = 2 ), we have ( CE = 2 ). 7.

Since ( triangle ABD cong triangle CED ), ( ABCE ) forms a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, ( BE = 2 times BD = 2 times sqrt{13} = 2sqrt{13} ). 9. Using the Pythagorean theorem in ( triangle BCE ): [ BC^2 = BE^2 + EC^2 ] Substituting the values ( BE = 2sqrt{13} ) and ( EC = 2 ): [ BC^2 = (2sqrt{13})^2 + 2^2 = 4 times 13 + 4 = 52 + 4 = 56 implies BC = sqrt{56} = 2sqrt{14} ] 10.

The volume of a cylinder (V_cylinder) is given by the formula: V_cylinder = π * r^2 * h where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder. Given that the diameter of the cylinder is 6 cm, the radius (r) is half of that, which is 3 cm. The height (h) of the cylinder is also given as 6 cm. Now, let's calculate the volume of the cylinder: V_cylinder = π * (3 cm)^2 * 6 cm V_cylinder = π * 9 cm^2 * 6 cm V_cylinder = 54π cm^3 Now, let's assume that the volume of the sphere (V_sphere) is equal to the volume of the cylinder since the material is the same. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula: V_sphere = (4/3) * π * r^3 where r is the radius of the sphere. Since V_sphere = V_cylinder, we have: (4/3) * π * r^3 = 54π cm^3 Now, we solve for the radius (r) of the sphere: r^3 = (54π cm^3) / ((4/3) * π) r^3 = (54/4) * 3 cm^3 r^3 = 13.5 * 3 cm^3 r^3 = 40.5 cm^3 Now, we take the cube root of both sides to find the radius: r = (40.5 cm^3)^(1/3) Using a calculator, we find that: r ≈ 3.42 cm Since the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, the diameter (d_sphere) is: d_sphere = 2 * r d_sphere ≈ 2 * 3.42 cm d_sphere ≈ 6.84 cm Therefore, the diameter of each sphere made from the material of the cylinder is approximately boxed{6.84} cm."},{"prompt":"The coordinates of the point A(1,2) with respect to the yaxis are ______.","completion":"To find the coordinates of the point A(-1,2) with respect to the y-axis, we follow the characteristics of symmetry in the Cartesian coordinate system.

Since every single person in Johnstown drives to work and there are 80 people, there are 80 cars. Each car pollutes 10 pounds of carbon a year, so the total pollution from cars is: 80 cars * 10 pounds/car/year = 800 pounds/year Now, let's calculate the reduction in carbon pollution when 25% of the people start taking the bus. 25% of 80 people is: 0.25 * 80 = 20 people These 20 people will no longer be driving their cars, so the reduction in pollution from cars is: 20 cars * 10 pounds/car/year = 200 pounds/year However, we are told that the town emits 100 fewer pounds of carbon per year, not 200.

For the shoes: Lyra paid 480 after a 20% discount. This means that 480 is 80% of the original price of the shoes (since 100% - 20% discount = 80% of the original price). Let's call the original price of the shoes S. We can set up the following equation: 80% of S = 480 0.80 * S = 480 S = 480 / 0.80 S = 600 So, the original price of the shoes was 600. For the dress: Lyra paid 350 after a 30% discount. This means that 350 is 70% of the original price of the dress (since 100% - 30% discount = 70% of the original price). Let's call the original price of the dress D. We can set up the following equation: 70% of D = 350 0.70 * D = 350 D = 350 / 0.70 D = 500 So, the original price of the dress was 500. Now, to find the combined original price of the pair of shoes and the dress, we add the original prices of both items: Original price of shoes (S) + Original price of dress (D) = Combined original price 600 + 500 = 1100 Therefore, the combined original price of the pair of shoes and the dress was boxed{1100} ."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=ln x frac {1}{2}ax^{2}+x, where ainmathbb{R}.

Thus the black checker needs to move: [ 2011 - 3 = 2008 ] squares to reach the last cell. 3. **Effect of Different Moves:** - Regardless of choosing run or fight, the black checker always moves precisely one square to the right each move. - Therefore, the game will always last exactly 2008 moves to move the black checker from the 3rd cell to the 2011th cell. 4. **Configurations and Differentiation:** - Each **run** does not change the number of white checkers compared to the initial state. - Each **fight** adds exactly one new white checker to the grid. - Therefore, the number of white checkers on the board is determined by the number of fights Rachel chose during the 2008 moves. 5. **Counting the Different Configurations:** - Let ( f ) be the number of fights chosen out of the 2008 moves. - Since every choice of ( f ) from ( 0 ) to ( 2008 ) results in a different number of white checkers added, the number of distinct final configurations corresponds directly to the number of fights. - The number of fights, ( f ), can range between ( 0 ) and ( 2008 ) inclusive, meaning there are: [ 2008 - 0 + 1 = 2009 ] possible values for ( f ). # Conclusion: Hence, there are ( boxed{2009} ) different final configurations possible."},{"prompt":"Michael bought some crates of egg on Tuesday.

We know that one side is 25 feet and the area is 260 square feet. To find the other side, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length × width We have one side (width) as 25 feet, so we can solve for the length (l): 260 square feet = l × 25 feet l = 260 square feet / 25 feet l = 10.4 feet Now we know the field is 25 feet by 10.4 feet.

Let the angle ( angle BOC ) be ( y ): [ BC^2 = OB^2 + OC^2 - 2 cdot OB cdot OC cdot cos(y) ] - And let the angle ( angle AOD ) be ( y ): [ DA^2 = OA^2 + OD^2 - 2 cdot OA cdot OD cdot cos(y) ] 4. **Sum these equations as well**: - Adding these equations: [ BC^2 + DA^2 = (OB^2 + OC^2 - 2 cdot OB cdot OC cdot cos(y)) + (OA^2 + OD^2 - 2 cdot OA cdot OD cdot cos(y)) ] This simplifies to: [ BC^2 + DA^2 = OA^2 + OB^2 + OC^2 + OD^2 - 2 cdot cos(y) cdot (OB cdot OC + OA cdot OD) ] 5. **Compare the two equations**: - For (AC) and (BD) to be perpendicular, we need the angles (angle AOB) and (angle COD) to be (90^circ). Hence, (cos(x) = 0). - This simplifies: [ AB^2 + CD^2 = OA^2 + OB^2 + OC^2 + OD^2 ] and: [ BC^2 + DA^2 = OA^2 + OB^2 + OC^2 + OD^2 ] - Thus, if (x = 90^circ): [ AB^2 + CD^2 = BC^2 + DA^2 ] 6. **Converse condition**: - If ( AB^2 + CD^2 = BC^2 + DA^2 ): - This implies: [ 2 cdot cos(x) cdot (OA cdot OB + OC cdot OD) = 2 cdot cos(y) cdot (OB cdot OC + OA cdot OD) ] - Note that ( cos(x) ) or ( cos(y) ) must be zero since the sums are equal and positive product terms otherwise. - If they are zero, angle ( x ) or ( y ) must be ( 90^circ ): [ x = 90^circ text{ or } y = 90^circ ] - Hence ( AC perp BD ) under the given conditions. # Conclusion [ boxed{AB^2 + CD^2 = BC^2 + DA^2 iff AC perp BD}"},{"prompt":"Two numbers have a HCF of 16 and a certain product.

To find the exact count of five-digit numbers divisible by 7, we consider the range from the smallest five-digit number to the largest: 10000 div 7 approx 1428.57 quad text{and} quad 99999 div 7 approx 14285.57. Thus, the multiples of 7 from 1429 to 14285 are: 14285 - 1428 = 12857 text{ total five-digit multiples of 7}.

Prove that (p) is divisible by (6k1).","completion":"Given the expression: [ frac{p}{q} = 1 - frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-1} ] we aim to prove that ( p ) is divisible by ( 6k - 1 ), where ( 6k - 1 ) is a prime number. Let's rewrite and decompose the expression in the following steps: 1. First, rewrite the sum by splitting into parts: [ 1 - frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-1} ] can be rewritten as: [ 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-1} - 2left(frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{6} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-2}right) ] 2. Notice that: [ 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-1} ] is the harmonic sum up to ( frac{1}{4k-1} ), and: [ frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{6} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-2} ] is half of the harmonic sum up to ( frac{1}{2k-1} ). 3. Hence, the original expression simplifies by subtracting these sums: [ = left(1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-1}right) - left(1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{2k-1}right) ] [ = frac{1}{2k} + frac{1}{2k+1} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-1} ] 4. The number of terms in the sum (frac{1}{2k} + frac{1}{2k+1} + ldots + frac{1}{4k-1}) is even. 5. Now, we can group these terms in pairs in the following manner: [ frac{1}{2k+s} + frac{1}{4k-1-s} text{ for } s = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 2k-1 ] 6. Indeed, for each pair: [ frac{1}{2k+s} + frac{1}{4k-1-s} = frac{(2k+s) + (4k-1-s)}{(2k+s)(4k-1-s)} = frac{6k-1}{(2k+s)(4k-1-s)} ] 7. Since (6k-1) is prime and given that the numerators of these fractions collectively sum up with (6k-1) being a factor: Each term in the form is: [ frac{6k-1}{(2k+s)(4k-1-s)} ] Thus, the sum of these terms yields a number whose numerator is divisible by (6k-1). # Conclusion: Hence, ( p ) in the fraction (frac{p}{q}) must be divisible by (6k-1): [ boxed{p text{ is divisible by } 6k - 1} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider the pentagon formed by joining the points in order: (0,0), (2,1), (3,3), (1,4), (0,2), and back to (0,0).

Hence, there is at least one color that has fewer than (100) chips. 3. **Number of Neighbors for Each Color**: - The maximum number of neighbors for any chip of a specific color is bounded by the total number of chips minus one (since we are placing them on a circle, each chip has exactly two neighbors). - Hence, if there are fewer than (100) chips of any color, these chips can form segments with other colors but not with themselves more than (99) times. 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**: - Consider the color, let's call it color (A), which has fewer than (100) chips. - The chips of color (A) are placed around the circle. Since there are (200) different colors and each chip of color (A) could potentially be next to at most (198) other chips (excluding itself), there must be some color (B) among the remaining (199) colors that is not adjacent with color (A) consecutively.

According to the given information, the watch was sold at a loss of 21%. This means the selling price (SP) at a loss is 79% of the cost price (since 100% - 21% = 79%). So, we can write the first equation as: SP at a loss = 0.79 * CP We are also told that if the watch was sold for Rs. 140 more, there would have been a gain of 4%. This means the selling price at a gain is 104% of the cost price (since 100% + 4% = 104%). So, we can write the second equation as: SP at a gain = CP + 140 = 1.04 * CP Now, the difference between the selling price at a gain and the selling price at a loss is Rs. 140. Therefore, we can write: SP at a gain - SP at a loss = 140 1.04 * CP - 0.79 * CP = 140 0.25 * CP = 140 Now, we can solve for CP: CP = 140 / 0.25 CP = 560 So, the cost price of the watch is Rs. boxed{560} ."},{"prompt":"A cistern of a certain length and 4 meters wide contains water up to a depth of 1 meter 25 cm.

Each fisherman in the first group caught 13 fish, so the total number of fish caught by the first group is: [ 13x ] 4. Each fisherman in the second group caught 5 fish, so the total number of fish caught by the second group is: [ 5y ] 5. Each fisherman in the third group caught 4 fish, so the total number of fish caught by the third group is: [ 4z ] 6.

Now, the total investment is the sum of investments by A, B, and C, which is 2x + (2/3)x + x = (7/3)x. The profit is distributed among the partners in the ratio of their investments.

[ A equiv k (mod 7) ] 3. **Understanding the change issue:** - Neznayka received ( C ) as change and he received one more coin than he used to purchase the item. - Since every coin leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, the change ( C ) in terms of modulus 7 can be expressed as: [ C equiv k + 1 (mod 7) ] 4. **Expressing the purchase price in terms of ( A ) and ( C ):** - The price of the purchase is the difference between the total paid amount ( A ) and the change received ( C ): [ A - C = A - (k + 1) equiv k - (k + 1) equiv -1 (mod 7) ] - Since subtracting 1 modulo 7 is the same as adding 6: [ A - C equiv 6 (mod 7) ] 5. **Finding the minimum possible positive value for the purchase price:** - The smallest positive value that satisfies ( A - C equiv 6 (mod 7) ) is: [ A - C equiv 6 text{ fertings} ] Therefore, the smallest possible price of the purchase is: [ boxed{6 text{ fertings}} ] Example to illustrate: - Neznayka pays with 1 coin of 1 ferting and 1 coin of 50 fertings, totaling: [ 1 + 50 = 51 text{ fertings} ] - He receives change in the form of 3 coins of 15 fertings, totaling: [ 15 times 3 = 45 text{ fertings} ] - Therefore, the purchase price is: [ 51 - 45 = 6 text{ fertings} ] The reasoning holds correctly with the coins and modulus arithmetic, ensuring that the smallest possible purchase price is indeed 6 fertings."},{"prompt":"The circle inscribed in triangle ABC touches the sides AB, BC, and AC at points C_1, A_1, and B_1 respectively.

Recall the property of tangents from a common external point to a circle: the lengths of tangents drawn from a single point to the points of tangency are equal. Therefore, we can write: [ AC_1 = AB_1, quad BA_1 = BC_1, quad CB_1 = CA_1 ] 2. Given ( AC_1 = BA_1 = CB_1 ), we can use these equalities to deduce that point ( C_1 ) is the midpoint of side ( AB ).

Given the recurrence relation: a_{n+1} a_{n} - a_{n}^{2} = 1, we note that a_{n} neq 0 for any ( n ). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: a_{n+1} = a_{n} + frac{1}{a_{n}}. 2.

First brother: \\"My brother has an orange-suit card.\\" We are also given the principle that if both brothers have cards of the same suit, one brother tells the truth and the other lies. Otherwise, if the cards are of different suits, they either both tell the truth or both lie. 1. **Assumption: Both cards are of the same suit.** - Given this assumption, one of the brothers must be lying. - Since they both claim their name is Treljalya, according to our principle, one of them is lying about their name, indicating that both cards are indeed of the same suit. 2. **Determine the suit of the cards:** - Suppose both cards are **purple**. - If both cards are purple, then the first brother's second statement (\\"My brother has an orange-suit card.\\") must be false. - If this statement is false, the first brother's first statement (\\"My name is Treljalya.\\") is also false.

Since the sum of each repeating subsequence is zero (i.e., a_{6k+1}+a_{6k+2}+a_{6k+3}+a_{6k+4}+a_{6k+5}+a_{6k+6}=0), we can pair the terms of S_{2002} in groups of 6 to cancel them out. The sum S_{2002} can thus be simplified to only consider the last incomplete subsequence: S_{2002} = a_{1999} + a_{2000} + a_{2001} + a_{2002}. The indices 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 correspond to the positions 6k+1, 6k+2, 6k+3, and 6k+4 respectively, for some integer k.

We need to analyze two scenarios based on whether (Delta < 0) or (Delta > 0), since (Delta = 0) does not produce distinct roots and not relevant for different points: - When (Delta < 0), i.e., (4m^2 - 4 < 0), we solve: [ 4m^2 < 4 implies m^2 < 1 implies -1 < m < 1 ] In this range, the roots (x_3) and (x_4) of the equation (x^2 + 2mx + 1 = 0) are complex conjugates and lie on a circle in the complex plane. Moreover, since the imaginary part of (x_3) and (x_4) is not zero and distinct from the real parts (x_1) and (x_2), this results in the points forming the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral. - When (Delta > 0), i.e., (4m^2 - 4 > 0): [ 4m^2 > 4 implies m^2 > 1 implies m < -1 text{ or } m > 1 ] In this case, the roots (x_3) and (x_4) are real and distinct. These roots must form endpoints of a circle on which the complex-conjugate points (x_1 = 1 + i) and (x_2 = 1 - i) lie. For this to be true, substituting (x_1 = 1 + i) and (x_2 = 1 - i) into the circle equation generated from equation roots will give us the condition for (m). Let's form the circle equation: Suppose ((x_3 + x_4) = -2m) and (x_3 x_4 = 1), for (x_1, x_2) on: [ (x-x_3)(x-x_4) + y^2 = 0 ] Substituting in: [ x_3 + x_4 = -2m, quad x_3 x_4 = 1 quad Rightarrow quad x^2 + y^2 - (x_3+x_4)x + x_3 x_4 equiv x^2 + y^2 + 2mx + 1 ] For ((1, pm 1)): [ 1 + 1 + 2m + 1 = 0 implies 3 + 2m = 0 implies m = -frac{3}{2} ] Based on both cases analyzed, the possible values for ( m ) are ( -1 < m < 1 ) or ( m = -frac{3}{2} ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{-1 < m < 1 text{ or } m = -frac{3}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"the positive arithmetic geometric sequence {a_n}, a_1a_5+2a_3a_6+a_1a_11=16.

Petya and Vasya take turns placing chips on empty cells of the board, starting with Petya. The player who makes a move resulting in every (4 times 4) square on the board containing at least one chip wins. We need to determine if there is a strategy guaranteeing a victory irrespective of the opponent's moves, and if so, which player has it. 1. **Initial Considerations**: - The board is of size (2020 times 2021), so it has (2020 times 2021) cells in total. - The aim is to ensure that each (4 times 4) square on the board has at least one chip. 2. **Key Idea**: - Vasya must play in such a way that Petya never achieves a win on his next move. Specifically, Vasya should always place his chip in some (4 times 4) square that remains partially empty, extending the game without letting Petya win immediately. 3. **Empty (4 times 4) Squares**: - If after each move by Petya, the board has at least two non-overlapping (4 times 4) squares with empty cells, Petya must place a chip in one of these squares. - Vasya can always place his chip in the other non-overlapping (4 times 4) square, thus ensuring Petya doesn't win. 4. **Critical Scenario**: - Suppose at some stage, the board is such that there are only two empty non-overlapping (4 times 4) squares left. When Petya places his chip, one of these squares will have at least one chip, leaving one (4 times 4) square completely empty. - Now, Vasya places his chip in this last (4 times 4) square. This ensures both remaining squares have at least one chip and the game continues. 5. **Conclusion: Cheating Detection**: - Suppose there are less than two pairs of non-overlapping (4 times 4) squares to choose from. This means all remaining (4 times 4) squares on the board overlap in such a way that placing a chip in one affects others. - If any placement exists where Petya can place a chip leading to all (4 times 4) squares getting filled, Vasya can block this by ensuring such placement completes at his turn. - Petya places a chip such that overlapping configurations leave some (4 times 4) squares with empty slots. Vasya's next move targets these coordinates, blocking immediate completion and securing his win eventually when configurations condense. Combining all these, Vasya can always ensure Petya's move won't satisfy the winning condition. Therefore, playing optimally, Vasya will always win regardless of Petya's actions.

It's made up of 78 squares, with an overall length of 12 inches. This means that the hexagon extends 12 squares along its longest diagonal. The hexagon also has two widths, 8 inches and 6 inches, which correspond to 8 squares and 6 squares respectively. To find out through how many squares the diagonal from the left-most point to the right-most point passes, we can use the fact that the diagonal will pass through at least one square in each column of squares along its length. Since the hexagon is 12 inches long, there are 12 columns of squares along the diagonal.

We begin by noting that the equations given are: [ begin{cases} a^3 + c^3 = 2 a^2 b + c^2 d = 0 b^3 + d^3 = 1 a b^2 + c d^2 = -6 end{cases} ] 2. From the second equation, ( a^2 b + c^2 d = 0 ), we can deduce: [ a = pm sqrt{frac{-d}{b}} c ] 3. We further analyze ( a ) and ( c ) from the equation ( a^3 + c^3 = 2 ). Since ( a^3 + c^3 = 2 ) and ( a b^2 + c d^2 = -6 < 0 ), at least one of ( a ) or ( c ) must be positive and the other negative: [ min{a, c} < 0 < max{a, c} ] 4. Given the above, we can assume ( a = -sqrt{frac{-d}{b}} c ). Let ( x = -sqrt{frac{-d}{b}} ), which gives us ( a = x c ). 5. Substituting ( a = x c ) into the equation ( a^3 + c^3 = 2 ) yields: [ 2 = a^3 + c^3 = c^3 (1 + x^3) ] [ 2 = c^3 (1 + x^3) ] [ c^3 (1 + x^3) = 2 ] 6. Let us consider the fourth equation ( a b^2 + c d^2 = -6 ). Substituting ( a = x c ) results in: [ -6 = a b^2 + c d^2 = x c b^2 + c d^2 ] [ x b^2 + d^2 = frac{-6}{c} ] 7. Combining these gives: [ (x b^2 + d^2)^3 = left(frac{-6}{c}right)^3 = -108 cdot (1 + x^3) ] Thus, [ -108 (1 + x^3) = left(d^2 left(x frac{b^2}{d^2} + 1 right)right)^3 = d^6 left(frac{1}{x^3} + 1 right)^3 = d^6 left( frac{1 + x^3}{x^3} right)^3 ] 8. Simplifying the assumption that ( x^3 + 1 neq 0 ), we arrive at: [ d^6 (1 + x^3)^2 = -108 x^9 ] [ d^6 (1 + x^3)^2 = -108 x^9 ] 9. Substituting: [ x^3 = left(-sqrt{frac{-d}{b}}right)^3 = -sqrt{frac{-d^3}{b^3}} = -sqrt{frac{b^3 - 1}{b^3}} ] [ (1 + x^3)=1-sqrt{frac{b^3 - 1}{b^3}} ] 10. Thus, [ (1+sqrt{frac{b^3-1}{b^3}})^2=-108left(sqrt{frac{b^3-1}{b^3}}right)^{3} ] [ y=sqrt{frac{b^3-1}{b^3}} ] [ b^3 = frac{1}{1-y^{2}} ] [ left(frac{1}{1-y^{2}}-1right)^2 (1-y^2)^2=108y^3 ] 11.
